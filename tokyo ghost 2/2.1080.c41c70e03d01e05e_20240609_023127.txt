Episode 4
Doctor! Mr. Iba!
Enough! I'm done!
Get out!
But...
Mado!
You'll pay for what you did!
Let's do this, Mado!
Shinohara!
I have to...
Arima!
I had a dream
When I was born
I lived so beautifully
In the city of the Earth
We stood up and laughed
The rainbow that swallowed the paint
I wanted to be embraced by you
But I couldn't walk alone
We laughed together
But I couldn't give you my love
And I couldn't touch you
I broke it with words
The game was over
Someone died in the far away city
TAKISKI GUL
Where's Mr. Arima?
He wasn't here last time
Oh, baby
We have a meeting of special investigators
He's not one of those who respects such things
He never respected
Even Mr. Shinohara came
He barely recovered
I...
I dressed up easily, so don't worry
Yeah
Let's go
Boss
Mr. Arima didn't come
I see
Well, okay
Let's start our meeting
Yes
After the battle in the 11th district, the 9th and 10th also captured Aogir
They captured them because many of our people died fighting in the 11th district
Oh, boy
If you called me earlier, Aogir wouldn't have run away
I'm not a boy for you
Judging by the reports, the 10th and 9th districts were captured by a group from Aogir
who were also reported to be one-eyed gul
Also, this one-eyed one is involved in the murder of the Mada investigator from the 20th district
So, Aogir also has a base in the 20th district?
Yes
Check this out, Mr. Shinohara
Okay
Damn it
Maybe we should take a break?
You're still young
You're right, Nishiki
Help me with the movies too
Mr. Koma, can I leave him here?
Yeah, sure
Can I help you, Mrs. Arima?
Sure
Help me with the movies too
Mr. Koma, can I leave him here?
Yeah, sure
Can I help you, Mrs. Arima?
Sure
Can I help you, Mrs. Arima?
Yeah
Listen, Hinami
Do you want to take a break?
But I'm not done yet
If you want to take a break, you can trust me with work
Damn, it hurts!
Hitare! Hitare!
Ouch!
Where did you get that piece of shit from?
Hitare! Hitare!
Hey!
Damn it!
You damn parrot!
Stop!
Nishiki, maybe you should calm down
Oh
By the way, where's Toko?
At the university, of course
She's a graduate
And where did she decide to go?
Kami
To my university?
She won't give up
To let you know, the entrance is very high
She wants to get into it
You should help her
Well, I think I can help
But why Kami?
Oh
Really?
Now she needs a goal
To which she can strive
Oh, great!
So you can work again
I need to prepare for the exams, so I won't work much
Still, be careful
Those guys haven't been caught yet
But they can attack you again
Don't worry
If they come to me, I'll do this to them
You're talking nonsense again
I'm kidding
Okay, then let's break them together
I'm kidding, I'm kidding
It's impossible
What? Education evacuation?
I heard they were already in the 9th and 10th districts
What? Really?
It's scary
Gole are being fed by people
Why do these gole even exist?
They should have died sooner
Dumbasses
Probably the next goal for Aogiri will be the 3rd or the 13th district
Maybe Aogiri wants to capture Tokyo from the west?
Yeah, we've seen that option too
But I'm asking you to send people to every district
At the 23rd as well?
To your boss?
As to Koklia
Based on the situation, there's no doubt that the owl has started to act
Plus, he controls the tree of Aogiri
I don't intend to repeat the nightmare of ten years ago
CCG will destroy both the owl and Aogiri
I don't intend to repeat the nightmare of ten years ago
CCG will destroy both the owl and Aogiri
Has it become smaller?
Yeah
So it's the owl
I didn't notice
Ten years ago we were already fighting with him
I remember
The legendary hunt for the first owl
I think the owl was a little bigger than now
Then a lot of investigators died
When I fought with him for the second time, many people were injured
But no one died
Probably with age the owl becomes smaller
Do you think he's an old man?
No, not at all
Shinahara
What if...
Let's not talk about it yet
Okay
We don't need to panic now
Shinahara investigator, a letter for you
Oh, you sent it right here?
Yes, I'm a messenger from Mr. Seida
I see, good luck
Thank you, have a nice day
Is he a new worker?
Yes, from district 20
A very capable guy
Have a nice day
Move, let's go
Let's go
Ready
Maybe you should stop it already
What?
You're an investigator
What if people don't get it right?
I'm sick of it already
Maybe I should sew up this talkative mouth?
Huh, Seida?
Listen, don't build something cool here just because you've been promoted
I'm against you being an investigator of the second rank like me
I see you always fight
Mr. Shinahara
Oh, Mr. Shinahara
Shinahara
Hi
Are you okay already?
Fortunately, I'm pretty strong
Shinahara, you're pretty good
Rumors don't lie
Oh, Hodge
Thank you for helping me while I was away
You're welcome
By the way, where's Amon?
He said he'd go to Mr. Mada's grave
I see
And I wanted to tell you that he's going to have a new partner
I see
I'm reporting
Joro is still hiding
There are clues about Gurman
Also, the search for the rabbit and those who help him continues
And also
I've been promoted to Senior Investigator today
Hey
What did you forget about my father's grave, Kataro Amon?
Who are you?
I see
You don't know yet
I'm your new partner, investigator of the second rank, Mado Akira
Mado?
Nice to meet you, Senior Investigator, Kataro Amon
Investigator of the second rank, Mado Akira
I've been working here since today
Nice to meet you
You're going to work with Akira, Amon?
Yes
What did she forget here?
You look good, Investigator Takizawa
Do you know each other?
We studied together in the academy
Akira was better in class, and Seido was second after her
Leave them
I see
I'm Suzuya Juzo
Nice to meet you, Mado
Nice hairpins
Nice to meet you, Juzo
At the meeting of special investigators, it was decided that the main task is to eliminate Aogiri and eliminate the owl
I think first of all, one-eyed Gul will come to the 20th district
Be aware that if he is one of the leaders of Aogiri, then he can have a base in this area
So be careful
If he is a member of Aogiri, then there is a possibility that Aozora and Gurman will also be in it, right?
No, it's unlikely
And why?
As always, my intuition told me about Investigator Mado
If my intuition does not suit you, I will ask you to be silent, Investigator Takizawa
Looking at the data about the brutal attacks on the 20th district, you will see a number of facts
In the case of Aozora in the last six months, there was no such thing
So
Did they move to another district?
No
Most likely she is dead
Well, then it explains everything
Stop, she?
All the victims are young men
Therefore, I assumed that it was her
According to the data in the last three years, it can be seen that from a certain point on, the brutal attacks stopped sharply
Because our Senpai work well
Let me finish, Investigator Takizawa
And also, judging by the records, at that time, none of the employees were promoted
At that time, in the 20th district, there were groups of hooligans, such as black dogs and N
But in the last ten years, there was no word about them
Since then, animal attacks have been rare, up to the very appearance of Aozora
Well, what are you leaning towards?
It is possible to guess that at the moment the hooligans of the 20th district are in charge of the group of hooligans
In fact, Aozora violated the rules by committing numerous violent attacks, which attracted even more investigators
Do you want to say that Aozora killed such an organization?
Yes
And this organization is Aogiri?
I didn't say that, I just said that it was possible
Then what do you say about the hooligans?
Why are you so angry, Investigator Takizawa?
The hooligan group in the 20th district is a good idea, Akira
We will continue the investigation in the hope that this group will lead us to Aogiri
Check all this as soon as possible, Mrs. Akira
Mr. Hojo!
That's why I was against Mada!
Akira, I understand, we studied together and all that, but try to get along with him
Yes, no problem
Listen, Akira, now I am your boss, show more respect in words, okay?
I try to speak as simply as possible, politeness takes away a lot of energy
What?
For example, could you, and please, you can say for 0.9 and 0.3 seconds, save 0.6 seconds
Let's say, asking you about something 10 times a day, in a year you can lose 2000 seconds, in minutes it is about 33 minutes
What can be done in 33 minutes depends on the person, but still it is a lot
Therefore, let's forget about the trifles and engage in the investigation
Investigator Amon
I am impressed, she is the daughter of Mada
I doubt that we will get along
Well, to begin with, invite her for lunch
I am sure that by drinking a little and talking, you will find a way to get along with her
I know, this is your first time, but everything will definitely work out
Yes, thank you very much
Lunch, then
Okay
Akira
What?
How about having a snack after work?
I'll be free in 10 minutes
Okay
No answer
I'm sorry, but I don't eat after 9 pm
Thank you for inviting me
Please forgive me, I need to finish the report
Well, Amon
What's wrong with you, boy?
What's wrong with you, boy?
What's wrong with you, boy?
What's wrong with you, boy?
What's wrong with you, boy?
Well, nothing
I see
I'm sorry for the delay
I'm sorry I'm so late, Eriko
It's okay, it's okay
I'm always glad to study with you, Toka
Thank you
Okay, I'll try my best until I win
I'll try my best until I win
But why did you suddenly want to study?
Huh?
Well, how to say
Decided?
Where are you going to go?
Well, to Kamen, probably
What?
Only smart people study there
Why? Why?
Why Kamen?
Eriko
I see, Toka
Good luck
You will study with your boyfriend
Idiot, he's not my boyfriend
Come on
Wait, Eriko
Sweetie
It's not like that
Bye
Let's go, one-eyed
Yes
Let's go
Let's go
Let's go
Let's go
Over me
Over me
Kaneki
Yes?
