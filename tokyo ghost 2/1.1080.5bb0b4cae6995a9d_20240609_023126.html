The game is over
Someone died in a faraway town
Tokyo Ghoul
So the guy who took my hand 10 years ago is here?
I see you have achieved a lot
I think you should take your hand off
How was it with your boss?
Special investigator Shinohara
Iwa
Yes
You will stay here, Hirako
Yes
Take care of the rest of them
Go with them, Amon
Amon
I will stay with you
It's an order, man
Do it
I will stay
Let me fight
You are famous and you will not die here
Go
I will not run away
Then do not interfere
Yes
I'm sorry, Hirako
I understand
By the way, where are your quinks?
Already on us
This organization is bad
Get out of there, stupid Ayato
Are you hanging out with people?
Megumi, damn you
Do you really like playing with people?
Forgetting that you are a monster
Since your wings are so fragile, I will tear them off
Is it a prototype or not?
But this arata protects well
Yes
We would have died with armor of ten years ago
Yeah
Did we win?
Yes
Looks like we lost
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine and ten
What?
Isn't it too much protection?
Buta
Hold on to him
Dulce
The ability to heal after losing half of your body
is not enough
It's not enough
It's not enough
The ability to heal after losing half of your body
is not enough
It's not enough
The ability to heal after losing half of your body
is not enough
Amazing vitality
I'd like to try it
Are we pursuing?
It tastes like shit
The world rules
Everything is decided by the superior power
You are weak
That's why you lost
Just like your father
Ivo
Yes
Ivo
How long can we survive with this armor?
Shall we go to the lab?
Let's do it
No problem
Okay, arata
Do it
Let's go
Yes
Cool
Kwing and Kakutja
Kakutja?
Can they hold on?
Incredible power
We won't let you eat
Shinohara
It bites me
Bad luck
At this pace
I will be eaten
What a cruel weapon
People attack and kill each other
Everyone tries to justify himself
thinking that he is right
But there is no reason to kill someone
Because the process of killing someone is evil
What?
If there is such a thing as a soul
then it is unlikely that it will help you
Ivo
Father
Even now you call daddy
He is dead
Kaneki
Kaneki
Kaneki
It's my fault
I'm sorry
Why are you so stupid?
Kaneki
I'm fine, senpai
Take care of Toki
Something in your face has changed, one-eyed bastard
I thought you died a long time ago
Since you are Toki's brother
I won't kill you
I won't kill you
That's why Bukashki and Zanteiku are so annoying
Bastard
So he became stronger?
It's not time yet
Yes
Listen
Do you want me to tell you a secret?
What?
What are you talking about?
What are you really doing in Aogir?
You can't know that
Shut up and listen
I'm telling you now
Bastard
Everything is for protection, right?
The most precious to you
You are strong
If you wanted, you would have killed me a long time ago
What do you want to do so much that you even entered Aogir?
I'll kill you
Nura
Hey, let me go, Nura
Hey
Nura
Nura
Nishio
Kaneki
What's going on?
Let's hurry
Yeah
Watch out
Mr. Shinahara, Mr. Kuraiba
Yeah, we're fine
You and Hirako find the shelter
We'll catch up with you when we take off the armor
Yes, sir
I wonder if we're going to die
I'm sorry
I'm not good at anything
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
You're probably one of Kaneki's friends
Kaneki's friends?
Yeah, Monsignor
Let's go
Everyone step back
Step back
Run faster
This way
Nura
Shit
Senpai, take care of Toki
Okay
Where are you going?
Hey
Kaneki
Nishiki
Sister
Let's go
It's dangerous here
Yeah
Kaneki
The others didn't come back?
Did they really die?
Mr. Tatara, do you think how many died?
I think about two hundred
Then we have to kill for these two hundred
Yeah
Looks like everything's fine
Yeah
Let's go
Kura
Shira
My lovely nest was destroyed
I understand people's desire and all that
But think about us too
I know
I was absent for a long time
So I decided that it's time to finally show up
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
It's time to finally show up
Clowns always laugh last
Right?
Ivo
Yeah
Did you notice too?
Was that a trap?
Yeah
Damn
Shinohara
About that owl
About that owl
But it's okay
You fought too, didn't you?
I'm sorry
Report on the losses
Where's my report?
Only about half of them are still alive
Damn it
That owl
Shira
Shira
Shira
Shira
Shira
Shira
Shira

Shira
Shira
I'm fine
Find the boss
Right
Listen...
when we get back do something about your hair.
What are theell you want?
Anything, member of the community.
Listen, when we get back, do something with your hair.
If you walk around the cafe like that, you're hardly going to help us.
Toka, I'm not going back to Anteika.
What? What? What are you talking about?
I'm going to Algeria.
I'm going to Algeria.
I'm going to Algeria.
I'm going to Algeria.
I'm going to Algeria.
I'm going to Algeria.
I'm going to Algeria.
I'm going to Algeria.
I'm going to Algeria.
