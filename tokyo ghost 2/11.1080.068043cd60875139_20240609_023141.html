What are you doing?
Why are we even fighting?
I don't know.
I don't want to fight you.
But...
Mada, are you asleep?
I'm sorry.
I'll take care of it myself.
Help Detective Amon and the fourth unit.
But...
You were ordered to cover them!
Follow me!
Do you think I'm the same as she is?
Don't compare us.
I didn't even know her.

Will you call me by your name?

If we had met under different circumstances, we would have talked from the heart.
Even if you lose your arm and leg, fight.
That's what Mr. Mada said.
Sorry, Aker. I lost.
He did it.
He's here.
Well, guys, our business is bad.
Yes, I understand.
It looks like Arima has arrived.
What?
Well, we can lose, right?
Hi.
What's wrong with them? Are they scared?
I'm scared.
I need to go back to Anteiko.
I'm alive.
For a long time.
Guys, guys.
I will save you.
