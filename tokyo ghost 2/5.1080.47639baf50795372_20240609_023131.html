        <pre>They will continue to kill us.
I hope you will remember this and will put it to the full.
That's all for me.
Thank you for watching.
See you next time.
Detective Amon.
Be brave, Shizuku.
Can a girl become a good detective?
Like you?
Of course.
One day we will definitely work together.
Kawakami, Shizuku, Yasuhisa, Kurona and Nashara.
It's so easy to kill a person.
Yes.
Rei?
Ah, Kurona and Nashara.
Good evening.
You didn't go to Shizuku's funeral.
Don't you feel sorry for her?
Why would I?
Think about it, she's dead.
Don't say that, it sounds disgusting.
Isn't it the same as having lunch or playing with her?
Rei, if you're joking, laugh.
Damn, I'm sick of it.
Joking?
Does it look like it?
Rei!
People die every day in the world.
She is only one of them.
It's like a classmate meeting.
Rei!
I'm Juzo.
Tell me, why did you decide to become a ghoul?
Shut up.
You'll understand soon.
I even changed my name so that they would take you.
CCG.
They're really choked.
Oh.
It's nothing personal, Rei.
It's mutual.
Please don't be offended by me.
Kurona!
I'm fine.
I'll heal now.
Will you heal?
Do you have enough time?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Someone died in a faraway town.
That was fast, but...
The hell...
Please, enjoy this 45 more times!
It opened!
I killed a lot of Ghouls.
So I know how much time it takes to cut you down.
I know.
That's who you are.
And now let's cut what's expensive for our Kurogane.
Grey!
Well, well...
Shura, no!
Take it!
Tukemon is expensive!
My Arata slowed down.
Why?
Shura!
Kuro...
You're next!
Kuro...
Kuro...
Leave me...
Run...
What?
What?
I wonder how these two became Ghouls.
All security is broken.
So be here, Kizawa.
What?
Hoji...
Long time no see.
I see.
So you're also a member of Aogir.
Give me back...
Fei and Yen.
Unfortunately...
Now it's...
impossible.
Kurogane
Kurogane
The boy stretched out his hand and said,
Let's be friends.
Godo happily smiled and shook his hand.
The end.
What?
Me too!
Me too!
Okay.
Good night.
Toka...
Ayata...
Father...
Kurogane
He's fast.
And what kind of Kaguna is this?
I'm not sure, but this Ghoul...
Is it really...
Kakutja?
Support should arrive soon.
If we unite.
Akira.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Kurogane
Get out!
Hey!
Ghoul...
Let's get out of here.
Yasuhisa.
Kurogane.
Inashara.
People became Ghouls?
Impossible.
Kurogane
Looks like it's time.
Even Arata can't save him.
It doesn't matter.
Got you.
You can't just take me.
Kurogane
My broken...
Fingers...
Forty...
Feet...
In my ears...
So...
How many Kaguna does this guy have?
Thousand...
Minus...
Seven...
Of all the Ghouls I've seen.
How many will there be?
You're the craziest.
Give me...
I'll cover you.
Kaguna F.A.
Get out of here, Takizawa!
This is your subordinate.
CRC gas?
CRC gas?
CRC gas.
As forkov murder, it's over.
Thank you.
Thank you.
What happened, investigator?
What's that?
I don't know.
One-eyed?
One-eyed!
I have a question for you, One-eyed.
What is it?
What is it?
What is it?
What is it?
What is it?
What is it?
What is it?
I wanted to escape.
Why?
Why didn't you kill me then?
I couldn't kill you.
That night you were crying.
You were crying.
And it was a lie.
I think I can hear the answer.
Why didn't you die?
Because you let me go.
I see sky above
As far as I can find
You will be part of
Is that all?
You're just a regular golem, aren't you?
The broken pieces of me
You're just a regular golem, aren't you?
You're just a regular golem, aren't you?
I don't want to eat anymore.
One-eyed!
I'm gonna startl.
uneven.
O..
Look at me.
Zavash!
Zavash?
Zavash!
One-eyed!
Zavash!
