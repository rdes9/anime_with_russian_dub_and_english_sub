        <pre>You should have at least warned me that you would come in.
It's very delicious, mom.
This is delicious.
Really?
You haven't eaten this for a long time, have you?
Yeah, it's delicious.
But it's strange that you came in.
What happened to you?
Nothing.
About the destruction of the owl?
The operation is not easy.
You also take part in it.
Takizawa.
Can you write?
The inscription is a pre-death note.
And what should I write?
One more?
You can't do anything.
But I have nothing else to say.
Everything will be fine.
For example, you can thank your friends and comrades.
Detective Kuroeva.
Yes.
Gentlemen.
I'm with you.
Detective.
Detective Kuroeva.
Yes.
Did you write about yourself, Captain Hirako?
A pre-death note?
Yes.
I have no idea what to write.
You can thank your relatives.
I wonder what investigator Arima will write.
Arima always leaves her empty.
Empty?
Horrible!
No.
He always thinks about what to write.
But in the end he doesn't write anything.
I asked Professor Chigiu to remake Dojimo.
My partner came up with how to use it differently.
I hope the operation ends by the beginning.
Akira?
Strange.
Do you visit her grave?
Did you study together in the academy?
Yes.
She died in the 24th district.
My books are a memory of her.
The 24th district.
My mother and father worked together in the department of this district.
The chief investigator was Maruta.
Then they hunted for him.
The father of the investigators was powerless against such a strong creature.
Investigator Maruta ordered to retreat to the headquarters.
Let me go!
This is an order, Kureo!
Let me go!
Kureo!
You bitch!
You bitch!
My mother was thrown by the strongest of them.
Bitch!
Since then, the father has been possessed by the owl.
I will avenge my father.
As soon as I see him, I will chop him into pieces.
This time for sure.
Akira.
Just act with your mind.
Do you think I'm the same as her?
Don't compare us.
I didn't even know her.
You're very tall.
As if he...
...was the same as him.
I don't want to die.
Kureo!
Kureo!
Kureo!
Kureo!
Kureo!
Kureo!
Kureo!
Kureo!
Kureo!
Kureo!
Kureo!
Kureo!
Kureo!
Kureo!
Kureo!
Kureo!
Kureo!
CCG headquarters has sent to district 20.
They surround the cafe. Today.
Many police forces have taken over district 20.
All roads are blocked.
CCG has declared that all civilians have been evacuated
and will be guarded until the operation is over.
Kureo!
Kureo!
Kureo!
Kureo!
Kureo!
Kureo!
Start the operation.
Kureo!
Kureo!
Kureo!

Someone died..
GULF of police
Welcome.
Don't be afraid, there are only two of them.
Only two, he says.
Stupid, huh?
So we don't just fight with ourselves?
It's a devil's monkey.
And black dogs.
They're enemies.
So why?
People, we're not giving up, are we?
No!
Go and die for me.
Yes, sir!
Take them!
The first squad is attacking!
These are devil's monkeys, black dobermans!
Black dobermans?
Why not Aogir?
Your boss!
Let the first squad force the enemy to split.
And the second and third will quickly destroy them.
Detective Marouda, you're in charge.
Got it.
This is Hachikawa from the third.
What's the matter?
Mr. Marouda, I take on the dogs.
Did you hear? Morgan, the monkeys are after you.
Yes, I understand you.
Just don't be stupid, Hachikawa.
Yes, sir.
The next one.
High...
...mind!
Hey!
It's dangerous.
Go to your mountain.
Gorilla.
Gorilla?
Gorilla?
Unfortunately, my mountain is here.
Hello.
Long time no see.
Black dog.
Gaw-gaw.
The fourth squad, block the exits.
Don't let them escape.
Yes, sir.
And here he is.
Attacks on others are evil.
From the very birth, we constantly take something from someone.
Life is a thing...
...helping to make a sin.
It is evil.
I realize that I am evil myself.
But you are not better.
And now...
...kill me!
Kill me!
Where are you going?
Vanteiko.
It's over.
Over?
We let them die?
We promised to help each other.
What will happen to the boss?
And with Mr. Komai?
And Mrs. Irimi?
They...
...wanted to share their views.
They took many lives...
...and sinned many times.
But thanks to Mr. Yoshimura...
...they understood why they did it.
Nevertheless, no matter how their hearts changed...
...the sins remained.
That's why they need to be punished.
Punished?
Fighting is their punishment.
For them and for those who are with them.
Then what about me?
I also killed...
...killed many people to survive...
...just for fun!
Don't tell me...
...don't tell me I should be punished.
Why?
Why?
The university, right?
I don't mind going there either.
Why?
My grandmother is disgusting.
She's cruel.
Why did they all leave?
Just because.
It didn't happen.
Kirishima, let's have lunch together.
My promise to Yoyko.
What's your dream?
The formula I taught you.
Tell me about it.
The cafe?
I think it's Andei's.
That's it.
That's it.
It's all gone.
No.
It can't be.
No one else.
THE END
Again, this disgusting, thoughtful look.
Nishio.
We haven't seen each other for a long time, Kaneki.
Yoma asked me to tell you...
...that Toki and the others are safe and sound.
So it's all over now?
It's all over.
The ordinary life that was normal is ruined.
Happiness didn't last long.
Yeah, the old man is a fool here.
He'll even rub his butt when he needs to.
However, the devil's monkey with Mrs. Irumi is no better.
He can also annoy.
What are you going to do?
Me?
I'm going to run, of course, you fool.
If I jump, I'll stand in the blue, and the old man with the others will really die in vain.
So...
I'll see Kimi for the last time and get out of here.
I can't wait for her to grow old.
Besides...
You're a beautiful girl.
I'll re-sleep with her for the last time.
If only...
...I hadn't brought you to Antioch.
And don't spoil the past.
Or she'll get sick of it.
I'm not angry.
I'm not angry.
Tell me, Kaneki.
You don't have to put it on anymore.
You can't escape them.
Mr. Tsukiyama.
Did you see how many of them are there?
What am I going to do if they kill you?
I'm ready to take a risk.
Then...
Then...
Die right here!
Are you blind?
Against such an army, even I, with all the power of the Tsukiyama family, am nothing!
What am I going to do, Kaneki?
No one will let me eat you!
Even if you're sick of living!
Kaneki!
Kaneki!
Shoot!
This is the level of the Triple S.
How are we going to...
Too bad.
If I wanted you to go to Antioch, I would have done the same.
I would have done the same.
I would have wanted you to treat Eve with your delicious coffee.
I'm sorry, Kaneki.
Please.
Don't go there.
Mr. Tsukiyama.
I'm sorry.
Thank you for trying to stop me.
But...
I can't sit and do nothing anymore.
Let's continue.
