        <pre>Are you going to fight too, Mr. Yoshitoki?
Yes, the order is above.
Owl, Aogiria.
They are the main problem of CCG.
Yes.
Maru.
I want you to be the deputy commander.
But I failed in the 11th district.
If you failed, then the other one was the same.
Don't worry.
Mr. Yoshitoki.
Do you agree?
If you ask, how can I refuse?
Now we will need any kind of help.
I don't know.
I'm not sure he will help us capture the owls, but if we talk to him...
The priest?
Yes.
Will he talk?
We'll send someone he knows.
Kataraamon, right?
The Owl means...
I'm here for the first time.
The Owl Containment Center.
The object on which the owls contain from C to SS levels.
Captured by us.
Its existence is classified.
I doubt that the investigators of our level ever visited this place.
I don't think that's the case.

TAKISKI GUL
TAKISKI GUL
Father?
Who allowed you to enter?
Huh?
Why are Kazuki here?
I thought they left home together with Saki and Yusuke a long time ago.
Setsu went out.
It seems we have to finish playing the family of Katara.
Why only me?
Just look who's here.
Long time no see, Katara.
Donata Porpora.
Double S level.
Cruel thieves.
Donata Porpora.
Double S level.
Cruel thieves and murderers.
One day he ran away from the shelter.
It seems they know each other.
My dear son.
Shut up.
You're not my father.
Shut up.
Where's that scary man?
None of your business.
I see.
So he's dead.
It's always written on your face.
What?
Is the main gate open?
Checking at this hour?
I wasn't informed.
Go check.
What?
Damn, I'm always on the run.
What do you know about the Augean tree?
Nothing.
What about the owl?
Nothing.
I knew it.
Katara, are you still wearing it?
I'm wearing it.
To remember those days spent in that shelter.
Oh.
I'm overflowing with hatred for you.
Detective Amon.
Akira.
Augean attack.
Looks better than your father.
Mr. Shinahara, this is Koji.
Listen.
It looks like an owl on a paleo gear.
What?
Mr. Amon and Akira are there now.
Got it.
We're on our way.
Damn.
To be continued.
To be continued.
To be continued.
To be continued.
To be continued.
To be continued.
To be continued.
To be continued.
To be continued.
To be continued.
There are too many of them.
There are not only Aogiri members here.
Liberated prisoners joined them.
Aogiri came for this.
This way!
Oh, I made a mistake.
I hit the wrong one.
I'm sorry, guys.
I'm sorry, guys.
I'm sorry, guys.
I'm sorry, guys.
I'm sorry, guys.
Here.
Mr. Shachi, I came to free you.
Hey, boy.
Why do you smell like rice?
So.
Like this.
And like this.
Or maybe like this?
I thought they would be stronger.
You.
Who are you?
Oh my.
Kuro no Inashira.
Now I'm Juzo.
Investigator of the second rank, Suzuya Juzo.
Akira.
The end.
Kouin Kihimura?
Damn trash.
Die.
My stomach.
My stomach hurts.
It hurts a lot.
It hurts so much.
What?
My head is spinning.
What?
CRC gas.
It relaxes the enemy.
I'll kill these two first.
Die.
Ouch.
It hurts.
Tears flowed.
What's wrong with me?
It hurts even more from them.
At first it was Yomori, and now.
It hurts.
It hurts.
At first it was Yomori, and now.
It doesn't matter.
Compared to the usual tears, it hurts more.
Much, much better.
I'll eat a piece more delicious.
I'll eat a piece more delicious.
I can kill like this.
Fast.
What?
It's Riza.
Damn kid.
Damn.
Damn.
Funny.
Funny.
Funny.
Detective Amon.
Run away from here.
We have nothing to die for together.
Your hands are intact.
Grab my hand.
Grab my hand.
Grab my hand.
Grab my hand.
Grab my hand.
Grab my hand.
Grab my hand.
Grab my hand.
Don't move.
Have me in your arms!
Don't slip your hand in it!
Start fighting even when you've got your arm slipped!
Those words.
It was the first thing that came to my mind, Mr. Mada.
Come on, let's get out of here.
Come on, let's get out of here.
Come on, let's get out of here.
Let's go.
Easy, easy!
Agh!
Shit!
Jyuzo came here again?
Nobody's home!!
I'm not lucky today.
What's wrong with your eyes?
Are you not human anymore?
We abandoned humanity.
We are not interested in their world.
Awesome!
You know what?
I've been thinking.
What will happen if one of the twins dies?
I'm an investigator, you're a ghoul.
So it's okay if I kill you.
No!
What kind of feeling is this?
Yeah, you're not bad.
I'll have to use Arata.
Arata
I see.
That's how you showed yourself.
Damn old man!
Arata
Arata
Go and don't get up.
Do you want to meet with Rize, Mr. Kamishiro?
This world is so beautiful.
It's like a dream.
It's like a dream.
It's like a dream.
It's like a dream.
It's like a dream.
It's like a dream.
It's like a dream.
It's like a dream.
This world is so bad.
Because it's ruled by the wrong people.
That's why Mrs. Ryoko died because of me.
If I don't get stronger, everyone will die.
Guys from Anteiko...
...are only...
...silly...
...that's why...
