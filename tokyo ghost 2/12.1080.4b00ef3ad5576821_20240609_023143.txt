It's hard to brew coffee, isn't it?

Hi, Kaneki.
Kaneki.
I knew it.
I knew everything.
Dirty.
It's poorly brewed.
I'm sorry, Kaneki.
Me too.
Not everything is so simple in life.
By the way, do you remember?
How Nishio made me back then.
Yeah, I thought I was going to die.
I wanted to pretend to be dead and lick, but that guy was merciless.
Well, you can't do anything.
Kaneki.
Thank you for trying to save me then.
Thank you.
Report.
There is no one nearby.
And there is nowhere to hide.
So they ran away.
Mr. Yoshitoki.
Kuroiwa is seriously wounded, but still conscious.
Shinahara is still unconscious.
He is barely alive.
First, the wounded.
Yes, sir.
Quickly.
4th squad, report the situation.
4th squad, over.
Chief Investigator of the Ministry from the 4th squad, answer.
Hey, Investigator of the Ministry.
Hey.
Do you hear me?
Hey!
Watching people in Anteiko, I always thought,
why are they so cheerful?
Among them was you.
I felt abandoned.
So I decided to do what I could.
But in the end, this massacre began.
And I couldn't handle it myself.
Don't try to settle everything yourself, Kaneki.
Isn't that how you always acted?
Yes.
And you know, Kaneki, now you are a celebrity.
One-eyed or what?
Did you come up with it yourself?
Hida?
I'm going to...
go around here a little.
Hida.
Kaneki.
Get out of there, Kaneki.
Get out of here, Kaneki.
Get out of here, Kaneki.
Get out of here, Kaneki.
Come on, let's go back home.
