I was wrong, it was not me who ate Gulley, on the contrary, it was me who ate myself.
It's almost time.
In response to the frequent attack of Gulley's organized groups, the Gulley's resistance commission decided to find and destroy their secret logos as soon as possible.
What is being done at the moment?
It's almost time.
It's almost time.
Are you sure you turned to the address?
How is it to love someone?
Well, it's kind of difficult to describe such a thing.
It's when...
When what?
When you want to do something for him, be near him more often, and so on.
How are you so... although not sure?
I don't think you understand anything.
No, I completely understand. Thank you.
Oh, you're talking about me?
The great devil monkey?
Shut up, Komoto.
Welcome.
The rich aroma of coffee along with the aroma of Kaneki is felt here.
This place is saturated with incredible hedonistic enjoyment.
A real...
Eldorado!
Is Mr. Yoshimura here?
Are you sure about that?
Yes.
It seems that Kaneki is engaged in cannibalism.
He wants to become a kakujo?
Mass cannibalism to become a kakujo.
That's what he's doing.
He...
He's changing his taste!
Tsukiyama, could you collect more information?
Of course, of course, no problem.
I would do it anyway, Mr. Yoshimura.
Excuse me.
What is it, baby Hinami?
Brother...
Don't worry, princess.
Kaneki is fine.
Kaneki is fine.
At least he's alive.
Can I talk to you, flower princess?
There is a cafe where Kaneki and I were.
Shall we go there?
Yes.
In that case, let's spend this wonderful time together in the cafe!
Then, Gidrangia...
Hortensia.
Hortensia?
Excellent!
Then, the soulful Maslina...
Maslina...
Olivier Oderan.
Olivier Oderan?
Just like someone's name.
That's right.
The soulful Maslina.
Humility and nobility.
The soulful Maslina.
Humility and nobility.
Flower painting of the soulful Maslina.
Flower painting?
Every flower means something.
But that's not all.
For example, the soulful Maslina means humility and nobility.
Just right for Kaneki, right?
Yes.
And finally, the first love.
What?
An incredible charm.
A flash of memories.
And...
True love.
How cute, baby Hinami.
I'm sorry, I need to go to the bathroom.
Baby Hinami!
Hinatka!
Mrs. Takatsuki?
I'm so glad to see you again, Hinatka.
Welcome.
I'm glad too.
What were you thinking about?
Well...
As I knew, you can't fool an adult.
Well, will you tell me?
Young man,
one coffee with ice, please.
I'll bring it right now.
I really want to help my brother.
But I have nothing.
Are you telling the truth?
What are you thinking about?
You know what?
I don't think you can do anything.
You're so cute and nice, Hinatka.
And I'm sure everyone loves you.
I'm sure your brother loves you, too.
He may look gloomy,
but he's probably afraid of loneliness.
I don't think you should have such a guy.
I'm sorry if I offended you.
But I think it's unfair to humiliate him
using warm words.
I doubt you can help him in his current state, Hinatka.
I think you're right.
That's right.
I have an important interview.
Here you go.
At your age, everyone has problems
that they can't handle on their own.
I went through it myself.
Don't worry about it.
In general, call me if you want to chat.
Okay.
Oh, Kaneki.
I remember him.
If I recall correctly,
it all started with this.
Our...
Our...
Our...
Our...
Our sweet memories.
Oh!
What a harmony!
Soulful oil.
Floreography.
And the last one.
The most important one.
Euphoria.
God.
Nothing interesting again.
Ordinary investigations are also important, Juzo.
But they are worth it.
Wow!
Where did you get these seams?
Hey, calm down.
Detective Shinahara.
This girl said she wanted an interview.
Don't you think the CCG rules
prohibit giving interviews?
I know, but...
She's famous.
Are you a writer?
Yes.
Here's a CCG.
Can I take a picture?
Oh, sorry.
Usually we don't give interviews.
Oh, come on.
I only have one small question.
I need it for the next book.
I want to write about gulias.
Then I'll try to answer.
That's great.
Then let's get started.
Is it possible to create gulias artificially?
What do you mean?
What if, for example,
you drink blood or take genes of a gulia,
transplant it into someone's body
and make a person a gulia?
Is it possible or not?
Well, I don't think so.
Well, I don't think so.
I'm just an ordinary worker.
I don't know if it's possible or not.
No idea.
I don't think it makes sense
to create even more dangerous gulias.
I don't think so.
I see.
Do you have any more questions?
Yes, one more.
What's your name?
Thank you very much.
It was very informative.
Oh my God, it's very tasty.
By the way, do you know
that in one cafe in the 20th district
they serve the most delicious coffee?
No.
Actually, there's a story about it.
Hey.
I don't think I can help you, brother.
And yet,
there must be something
that I can do.
What happened?
Mr. Kaneki is here.
He's with the boss.
What?
Hey, Hinomi!
What?
Well?
I'm surprised.
You're so good.
Thank God.
Almost everything is right.
But classical literature is not given.
It's okay, you can do it.
Just try.
Yes.
But...
Why are you trying so hard?
Well...
Will you ever tell me?
Yes.
Hinomi?
Brother.
Where is he?
He just left.
What?
I spoke to the boss.
He asked me to come back to Anteiko.
And?
What?
I don't know.
I want to protect you.
I don't want to lose my loved ones.
That's why
I have to become stronger.
That's why, Aogiri,
we don't need your protection.
You only pretend to think about others.
In fact, you only care about yourself.
I just want you to be not alone.
You made a smart face,
a hero of some kind of tragedy.
You can't even protect yourself.
I won't let you take care of others.
Don't you dare come to us again.
Why?
Why?
Why?
Why?
Why?
Why?
Why did you do that?
Why?
Why?
Now he won't be back
hearing all these curses from me.
I have to study.
I'm sick and proud
How will I live a life without you?
Chef, there's a pigeon
Wow, it looks delicious
You have a beautiful waiter
Thank you
Did you want to talk to me?
Yes, Kaneki Ken
He used to work for you, didn't he?
Yes
Do you know where he is now?
Alas, we haven't seen him for two months
I don't know if it will help you, but
As far as I know, he was doing organ transplant
I'm sure he's not in the best shape
By the way
Didn't we meet before?
I don't remember
I don't think we met
I'm sorry, I made a mistake
Thank you for your help
Let's go, Juzo
Thank you for the treat
Coffee
Very tasty
We'll be back
