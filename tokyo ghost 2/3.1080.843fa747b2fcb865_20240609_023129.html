        <pre>Boss! Boss! I want to see you! Boss!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Who are you?
Boss!
It's true. He's strong, as Papa said.
Damn! Hurry up and get him out!
One-eyed
I'm burning!
I'm burning! I'm burning!
Boss! Boss! Boss! Boss! I'm burning!
Boss! Boss, I'm Borya!
Hey, damn! Are you...
Boss!
My feelings! My feelings for the boss are so hot that the car turned over!
What's wrong with you?
You barely survived and you're an idiot here.
Idiot?
Only Boss Emore can call me that!
And you!
I'll cut you into pieces!
I'll cut you into pieces!
I'll cut you into pieces!
Tokyo Ghoul
It would be nice to have people who look like candies.
And...
Do you like the new book?
Yes, it's a bit complicated, but interesting.
It's interesting!
Do you want to read it, sis?
No, thanks.
Listen, sis.
Tomorrow Takatsuki-sen will give out autographs, but...
Okay.
Let's go together?
Really? Thank you!
Then...
Next, emergency news.
A police van CCG has just been attacked.
According to eyewitnesses, the attack was led by the wanted one-eyed ghoul.
CCG claims...
One-eyed?
Brother?
But there was a reason, right?
Brother wouldn't have done that!
Hinami...
Let's forget about him.
But...
He's not with us anymore.
Okay.
Good night.
You're not in the mood, Toko.
Something happened?
Yes.
Something happened to Hinami.
What's going on?
Are you flirting?
In that case, let me be the devil's monkey.
Kuma.
Clean the tables, okay?
Got it.
Well, you're an adult here.
Right.
Good morning!
Come on.
Good morning, Hinami.
What's that outfit?
I borrowed your clothes.
May I?
I don't mind.
You're in the mood.
Are you going somewhere?
Yes, to the bookstore.
Takatsuki-sen is giving out autographs.
Can we go together?
No, I'll go alone.
Alone?
But...
The station is closed.
But...
Take care of Hinami.
Okay?
Okay.
I'm going.
It's not always good to watch my sister.
Don't worry.
Kuma will take care of her.
Okay.
Oh, my dear Hinami,
you've finally become independent.
Shut the hell up!
Here you go!
I missed a little.
Damn it!
Aren't you at the university?
I forgot my laptop in the locker room.
Damn it!
What?
Are you going to the university with me?
What?
You're going to Kami.
Have you been there?
Miss Rimi.
Go.
The boss will be back soon.
Okay, I'm waiting.
Get dressed quickly.
Hey, Nishiki!
This is the administrative building,
and there is the research building.
Is there a separate building for each subject?
Not always, but you have to experiment and so on.
Well, this is the dining room.
I'm starving.
I couldn't stand it before the temptation.
I agree.
But sometimes you can support yourself in silence.
It's huge.
The senior school is not even close.
It's a mega-university.
Well, I'm going,
Kami is waiting for me.
Hey, stop!
Don't cry if you get lost.
I wish he showed me the way.
So he's studying here.
I wouldn't be surprised if he always reads
all kinds of smart books.
The inscription on the poster.
Don't be indifferent.
Help me find this guy.
Will this...
help me get him back?
So, maybe here?
Senpai, you can't take him off.
You're a fool.
He's supposed to hang in the most visible place.
Like this.
Toka?
Damn, they don't have the end and the end.
Did you find anything useful in these notes?
After reading the report of Mrs. Aker,
I got a little worried.
Is it her intuition again?
I used to have a boss
who had a very good intuition.
Mada Kureo.
Mrs. Aker's father.
He was also very stubborn.
That's what they're like with Aker.
Hold it, Toka.
Thank you.
I see, so you sewed it in the chamber?
Yes.
I came to take a look.
I think you'll like it.
I see.
And Kaneki...
What kind of Kaneki was it before?
I don't know.
What kind of Kaneki was it before?
What kind of Kaneki was it?
Kaneki?
Before, after school, on weekends,
he was constantly reading books.
After his mother's death, he even changed a little.
Since then, he's always looked lonely.
That's right.
By the way, once he played the leading role in a play.
In a play.
He did a great job!
He really amazed everyone.
He really amazed everyone.
What did it become?
What did it become?
When he played the role of wearing a mask,
it seemed he was always thinking about something of his own.
It seemed he was always thinking about something of his own.
Maybe he wasn't able to keep everything to himself and ran off somewhere.
Maybe he's just reading a book somewhere.
That's why I'm sure he's okay.
Toka, do you know what kind of habit Kanaki has?
A habit?
When he hides something, he always rubs his chin.
Just don't expose me.
Sorry for the delay.
I'm late. I'm late.
Oh, ma'am!
Hooray! I made it!
I'm late!
I'm late!
I'm late!
I'm late!
I'm late!
I'm late!
I'm late!
I'm late!
I'm late!
Yes, you are.
I'm sorry.
I overslept.
Next, please.
Oh, what a cute girl.
What's your name?
Hinami.
Hinami, you mean.
What is it, Hinami?
It's a present for me.
It's so cute.
How can I sign it?
Kaneki Kenu.
Kaneki Kenu, right?
Can you tell me how to write it?
Well, Kandi, as in the word Jupiter and as in the word shine.
Oh, that's a very good way to remember Kaneki Kenu.
Your favorite?
No, he's my brother.
How cute.
Probably very good.
Thank you, Hinami.
And thank you.
Bye-bye.
Kaneki Kenu, you mean.
Hello, your package.
Oh, a postman.
I'm a peddler.
Could you already remember Mr. Seido?
And what's this?
Hm?
A recording of one-eyed Guli.
If I'm not mistaken, the first time I saw him,
I was surprised.
If I'm not mistaken, the first time I saw him,
I was surprised.
So you know?
Yeah, they suspect the rabbit
of the investigator's murder.
And who's this Naki?
He's like Jason from the 30th district.
He was kidnapped by one-eyed during the transfer to Koklia.
Koklia?
It's a Guli detention center in the 23rd district.
They keep S and SS rank Guli there.
Wow, that's scary.
Yeah, I wish I could work there.
Do you think he saved one of his own?
Who knows?
Guli have friends.
So organizations like Auger are a rarity?
I didn't say that.
The owl that appeared 10 years ago
was the one he subdued.
Also, there used to be Guli groups
like black dogs and monkey faces.
How long have you been trading information,
investigator of the second rank Takizawa?
Hello, Miss Akira.
Nagatsuka, right?
Looks like you're interested in Guli.
Come on, I saw it in the news,
that's why it became interesting.
Well, I've got a lot of work to do,
so I'm gonna go.
Wow, it's huge!
This is the CCG lab.
This is where they're doing research on Winky,
on Yupuli, and everything related to Guli.
Investigator Shinohara.
Professor Chigewa.
Hello.
So, here's Suzuyas.
You killed Jason, didn't you?
You're probably strong.
Well, he was already dead.
Oh, come on.
Sorry for the delay, Suzuyas.
Here's your Winky.
Well, it looks cool, doesn't it?
Suzuyas?
Let's try it!
No, it's Stalk Winky!
Mr. Shinohara, can I call him?
Yeah, if that's what the owner wants.
Then... Jason Juzo.
It can't be!
No, I don't believe it!
I don't believe it!
Boss Yamori...
He couldn't die!
Boss!
Damn CCG!
I'm gonna kill you all!
I got you!
Boss!
Boss!
Boss!
My dear boss!
I want to see you!
Boss!
Yamori!
Boss!
Boss Yamori!
It's okay, isn't it?
It's gonna be okay, isn't it?
Boss!
My dear boss!
The name is Yamori.
Is that Yamori?
Yes.
Boss!
Boss Yamori!
One-Eyed! You're a good guy. Thank you so much!
Kaneki Ken
What?
Nothing
Hey, have you heard?
About that one-eyed novice
They say he's strong
Have you heard the rumors?
Rumors?
What rumors? Tell me
They say he devoured Yemori
Yemori?
Straight alive
Come on!
Horrible!
He's a real monster
Yeah
Kaneki
Cannibal?
Kaneki
Unbelievable!
Oh, Kaneki
You've got more spicy
Cannibalism
A forbidden fruit for Gull
You want more power?
I want to eat him
Adam who ate a forbidden fruit
Even more delicious Kaneki
I'll eat him
Sick bastard
Damn
Can you tell us about
your friends?
Let me share with you what worries me
Yeah, we checked the event
starting with the one-eyed
and found a series of mysterious phenomena
Mysterious phenomena?
Yeah
Four months ago there was an accident
with falling steel beams
If I'm not mistaken
a heavily wounded guy
without his consent
was transplanted into several organs
of a dead girl
Yeah
As a result
the investigation ended
with the mysterious disappearance
of a guy and a surgeon
who operated on him
The guy's name is Kaneki Ken
He's a student at Kami University
Kami University?
Yeah
Don't make such a fuss
Don't make such a fuss
So he's a movie star
That's not him
