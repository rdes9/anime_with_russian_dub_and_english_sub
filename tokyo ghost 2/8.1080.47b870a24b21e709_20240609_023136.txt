Episode 1
Could you tell me about the owl?
Episode 2
He was a gulam named Guzetta
Episode 3
Like other gulams, for the sake of survival, he not only fed on people,
but also killed his own.
A cursed fate, strong and lonely.
The rumors about the owl quickly disappeared.
Until they were interested in one organization, they decided to recruit him.
He did as ordered, killing both people and gulams.
That was his job.
As before, he was lonely.
The organization never became a home for him.
Episode 4
One day a man came to Guzetta's cafe.
Do you want more?
Always the same place, always the same coffee.
No sugar, right?
Episode 5
You're bad at reading kanji.
Then I'll teach you.
I...
Let's go.
Let him be lonely and never tell his feelings,
but still he let her into his heart.
But...
Episode 6
It's hard to be lonely.
She accepted him.
Episode 7
So our child is also...
Only a child of a man and a gulam can...
Episode 8
You need special nutrition, right?
Don't worry.
A miracle will happen.
And she made him a miracle.
Episode 9
We finally got happiness.
But it didn't last long.
Episode 10
Yukina!
Episode 11
Episode 12
Guzen came back alive.
But...
There was no child anymore.
So, over time, Guli appeared.
The one who hated the whole world,
who was called an owl.
The one-eyed owl.
Yes, my child.
Episode 11
Snow...
Episode 12
Episode 12
Episode 12
Are you moving?
Yes.
They want to reconstruct the building.
I see.
Then maybe you can stay with us for a while?
Thank you, but I'll stay with my relative.
Damn, I thought I could cook you breakfast.
Sorry.
Snow?
What?
Really?
For how long?
Good question.
I hope so.
The same.
Look, Nishiki, it's snowing.
I'm cold.
Yes, it's cold.
Maybe you can wait for me at home from work?
No.
We're almost at Anteiko.
I'll take you home.
I don't understand girls.
Such moments are very important.
Yes, yes, I understand.
Wow, it's getting stronger.
We shouldn't have taken an umbrella.
Damn, why are there so many of them?
And yet there are so many visitors.
Great, right?
Well, you have to work hard until Toko comes back.
Hinami, you're at the checkout, the rest is up to me.
Yeah.
And me?
And you?
Don't break anything.
Mrs. Irimi, three Americanos, please.
Okay.
Mr. Koma, we need four double.
Got it.
Toko, what are you going to do after graduation?
Oh, we didn't even pass the exams.
Then let me rephrase.
What are your plans for the future?
Plans for the future?
I haven't thought about it yet.
And you?
Become a cook.
Great, good luck to you.
Thank you.
What do you dream about?
Dream?
Yes.
It's more of a desire than a dream.
For example, tell me.
Become a teacher or open a cafe.
Cafe?
Like Anteiko?
Yes.
Like a cafe, right?
It feels like a cafe really unites people.
Yeah.
That's what I like.
Then I'll work for you.
Of course.
I read your report.
Do you have proof?
Do you have proof?
Proposal?
Yeah.
You're not Kureo, are you?
It is not possible that the investigators of the 20th district will give up.
I need to find a replacement.
I'm counting on you, Maru.
You're fast.
Leave me alone.
I had to sweat today.
Are you like Hinami?
Tired?
No, half-fun.
By the way, Roma.
You worked for the first time, didn't you?
Only two dishes were broken.
Well, only two with such a crowd is already an achievement.
Mr. Nishiki, you are too kind.
Did you really think of something bad?
What?
Don't talk nonsense with such a smart face.
And yet, we have not served so many people for a long time.
Yes.
Right.
They barely called the most powerful weapon Anteika.
The most powerful weapon Anteika?
Who are you talking about?
It's...
Remember the devil.
The most powerful weapon?
Did he joke?
Probably.
What?
It's true.
Although many years have passed.
Mr. Yoma worked for Anteika?
I can't believe it.
He made a great coffee.
Yeah?
True, he was rude to the clients.
You figured it out, Toka.
Oh, there's still a little bit left.
We can do it here.
Thank you very much.
Let's go, Hinami.
Yes.
It's true?
Yes.
And what about you?
I have one shareholder.
I want you to take care of the rest.
Okay.
Mr. Seida.
Everyone is worried about something.
Did something happen?
I don't know.
They didn't tell me anything.
I see.
I'm sorry, I'm in a hurry.
Look, it's still snowing.
It might snow.
Well, Yoma, I'm counting on you.
Yeah.
Toka.
Coming.
Chef, if you need me, call me.
And me.
Thank you.
Yeah, it looks like we're going to get wet.
Welcome.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
Would you mind if I join you?
Of course.
Please.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Tasty.
Thank you.
Are there any other grains this time?
Of course, they play a role.
But the fact that they are fried and used water is no less important.
How so?
Personally, I think that the approach to boiling the grains is important.
But where did they come from?
The approach?
Yes.
The approach changes depending on the grains.
If you don't prepare them carefully, the result won't be good.
On the other hand, even cheap grains will do.
If you brew them carefully and carefully, they will be delicious.
I see.
Very informative.
Thank you.
I liked it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
Oh, thanks to the establishment.
But I...
Okay, since you insist.
Thank you for the treat.
It's snowing.
I can't wait.
Now everything is shiny.
We cleaned everything carefully.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Please, have a taste.
Yes, with pleasure.
Thank you very much.
And this life goes on
I'll be strong
I'll be strong till I see the end
Glassy sky above
As long as I survive you will be part of me
I miss them
We'll be together till the end
Or are you against it?
And still, Yukina, my wish didn't come true.
I ask you to give us a mission to eliminate the owls.
Did you find the target?
Yes.
In the cafe of the 20th district called Anteiko.
