        <pre>Thank God.
So, in a couple of days, they'll sign it?
Yeah, sorry for bothering you.
Then I thought
that you were killed.
He ate my orator.
And it was
one-eyed Kakujo?
One-eyed Kakujo?
That's a good question.
They say that if you eat something like that,
you'll become like them.
Kakujo?
No,
more like half of it.
He's very dangerous, Amon.
Amon!
Amon!
Amon!

Hold!
How did a man become a ghoul?
If it's really possible, then...
Thank you very much!
Oh, I'm sorry!
A peddler?
Oh, Mr. Amon!
It's you, I'm sorry.
Are you hurt?
No, I'll help.
It's a secret.
One-eyed.
Did something happen?
No, nothing.
It's just that lately I've been hearing a lot about this one-eyed thing.
It's even a little scary.
Well, I'm off.
Yeah, good luck.
I...
I don't want to eat anymore.
I'm too worried.
Father, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Father...
I'll definitely find an owl.
Oh!
We should have held him tighter.
But...
It's okay, we'll buy another one.
Really?
I promise to hold him tight.
Tell me, Mom, did I do well today?
Let me think.
Today, Ritchie, you earned 60.
Catch the boy with the glasses.
60 means?
And now, Ritchie, it's going to be...
It's time for us to play.
Kill him!
Finish him!
Spare me!
We're getting the glasses.
10, 20, 30, 40, 50.
Come on, come on, come on, come on!
More, more, more!
Ritchie!
Isn't my animal beautiful?
I agree, he's a real artist.
Pigeons, let's go!
There she is, the big lady.
Don't miss her.
Wait.
The boy has incredible physical abilities.
He doesn't need to graduate from the academy, he can start right away.
But he's far from perfect.
He didn't even hear about ethics.
Yeah, he's very cruel and aggressive.
All the downsides and misfortunes.
What can we do?
He was raised by Gul.
It's unlikely he'll become a human.
The boy had to live like that, right?
I consider him a victim.
Pretty big ant.
I'm your new partner, Shinahara Yukinori.
Suzuya Juzo.
Nice to meet you, Juzo.
I didn't know I saw a giraffe.
Oh, it's a cat. Sorry, sorry.
Have you had enough, Mr. Shinahara?
Yeah, kind of.
Do you like animals?
It's fun to see them in aviaries.
I see.
Mr. Shinahara, is the owl really strong?
Yeah, very.
I can't wait to see it.
I can die next time.
It doesn't matter if we die or not.
Juzo.
I'll be upset if you die.
Well, let's have lunch and go home.
With pleasure.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Damn.
What do I do?
Roma!
How much do you want, damn rascal?
You need to be nice to the girl, Nishiki.
You're just whining to her, that's the result.
The broom is in the closet, run!
Yeah.
Mrs. Roma, are you okay?
Here, take it.
Oh, thank you, Hinami.
Currently, the 23rd district is considered a high-risk area.
We ask you to be careful of those who live in it and those who go there for work.
She's talking about the one-eyed hikari, the one I heard about.
Yeah.
Cool.
I wish I could see him.
You saw him, Hinami.
I'm sorry, I need to go to my room.
Tell me, tell me, tell me, how does he look?
How?
Well, tell me.
Roma!
Even the devil's monkey can't handle her.
Only the damn toki can.
Toki is preparing for the exams, so Roma will replace her.
Hey, Rimi, you could help if you weren't busy.
I'm sorry, I have a day off.
Hinami?
I saw Toki in the library.
Don't bother her.
Yeah.
Modern Japanese inscription.
Hey, can you imagine? CCG was killed in the 23rd district.
Oh, that's scary.
It's supposed to be done by a guy on a prison bus.
He says he attacked the CCG department alone.
Really? A real monster.
He says he's one-eyed and wears a toothed mask.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Mr. Amon, I'm done with the reports.
Yeah, thanks.
Maybe we should grab a bite somewhere?
I don't mind.
Let's grab a bite.
Let's go.
Yeah?
Let's get that fried kebab.
Okay.
They have the best sauce.
Come on, Mr. Amon, let's go.
Yeah.
Akira.
Did you want something?
Maybe you can join us?
It's been 20 hours and 18 minutes.
Since it's close, I'm with you.
Hey, listen, Mr. Amon.
What? Yeah, sorry.
I...
I swore to get a promotion
and start hunting for cruel hooligans like Aogiri.
Well, then why did that happen?
Why did the hunter and the second-in-time student of the academy
end up in the district 20?
Huh, Mr. Amon?
Hey.
Takizawa.
The investigator's job is not to get promoted.
There you go.
She's getting on my nerves again.
She's always like that, Mr. Amon.
You always annoy me,
but I think such behavior is...
Basem Gimaroem.
Like that.
What did you say?
Hello?
Who the fuck are you?
I have an important conversation here.
Hello, Takizawa?
This is the fucker.
Looks like your report is incomplete,
so go back to the office and finish it.
Hey, did something happen?
Well, I need to go back to the office.
Oh, I see.
I'm sorry.
Be careful.
Are you okay, Akira?
You're Takizawa, aren't you?
Do you also think your career is more important?
Father.
He was very experienced and talented,
but in the end he became a senior investigator.
Compared to his mother,
who became an assistant to a special investigator
at a young age,
he didn't even get promoted.
They even called him an idiot.
You can still take revenge.
But as long as you have a goal,
a title and a status,
nothing will happen.
That's what my father said.
It's all my fault.
My father was watching me while I was working.
I thought I could help him if I grew up faster.
He talked a lot about you.
He was proud of you.
My father was right.
When you saw the owl,
you didn't even tremble.
I was the opposite.
It's okay, you were wounded.
My mother
killed the owl,
the father who swore to take revenge.
When my father fought the rabbit,
where the hell were you?
Why weren't you around?
Why didn't you fight him?
You're so strong.
If the senior investigator were around,
he wouldn't have died.
I...
You killed your father.
I hate you.
I hate you.
Akira, you're absolutely right.
I killed Mr. Mada.
I still dream of a nightmare.
If only I were stronger.
I would have saved him.
What are you talking about?
That's why I want to protect you.
I'll protect what was dear to him at any cost.
I see.
Akira?
Hey, Akira!
Damn it!
Akira, we're here.
Cat?
Good evening.
Excuse me.
Akira, I brought the...
Akira, I brought the...
I'll leave the pills and water here.
Well, I...
Stay.
Stay.
Akira.
Father.
I didn't notice.
What am I?
What...
Slav! Slav! Slav!
Slav! Slav!
Damn Slav!
298...
299...
300...
Maristella...
700...
800...
90...
What are you doing?
I'm getting out of here.
I graduated from the academy with a difference.
Together with the senior investigator Mada, I killed one cruel ghoul for another.
In less than three years, I became an investigator of the first rank.
I participated in the cleaning of the 11th district, personally killed many cruel ghouls, including the tailed brothers.
At the age of 27, I became the senior investigator.
But in fact, he turned out to be...
A real pervert who was doing push-ups in his subordinate's apartment.
I'm kidding.
Eat.
Until my mother was gone, I did everything at home.
It must be delicious.
Bon appetit.
Bon appetit.
Investigator Amun,
I'm sorry I brought you trouble.
It's okay.
The people gathered here were selected by me personally.
As a member of a special squad for the destruction of the owl.
From today, you are subordinate to me.
Now there is no doubt that the owl is the head of Aogiri.
The operation to destroy will begin immediately after the discovery of their logo.
Aogiri, like the owl...
Disappear.
To be continued...
