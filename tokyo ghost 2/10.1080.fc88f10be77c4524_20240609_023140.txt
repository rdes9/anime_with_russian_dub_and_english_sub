PART One
Mr. Koma!
What time is it...
Oh, Godüñê avoid me!
Lady Eremy
Chef.
I saw a beautiful city of the Earth that lived as beautifully as time was born.
We sang and laughed.
The color of the rainbow that swallowed the paint changed.
I wanted to be embraced.
But I couldn't walk alone.
We laughed together.
The toy was pierced with love.
The children who were touched were broken with empty words.
The game was over.
Someone died in a faraway town.
Tokyo Ghoul
Don't let them in!
Misato!
It's too early to relax, Satokizawa!
Shut up! I'm just warming up!
I don't want to get in the way of the investigator!
Iwa!
Hoji!
Mr. Shinohara!
He's strong, isn't he?
Of course, he's strong.
But he regenerates much better.
He's definitely the greatest enemy of the CCG.
High mind!
Damn, it's hard to fight without screaming.
camp
Cl mini
What's this?
Diffusion.
Damn it!
What? Did you get away from my supreme mind?
Special researchers are strong.
And yet, the devil's monkey will definitely win.
Stay calm and die.
You dirty scoundrel.
This scoundrel will tear you apart.
Damn it.
Rejected.
Stay calm and die.
After you.
Stay calm and die.
Stay calm and die.
We, homo sapiens, will never lose to some monkeys.
Strong.
Is this what you call a level S?
It's like you came from a village.
Don't you have a huge sword?
God, what a noise.
K... Kul...
Citizen.
Captain Hirako.
Finish them both.
Mr. Hachikawa.
Damn old lady.
I gave in to the feeling and got caught.
Well.
Well.
It's time for us to circle around.
My angel.
I want to drink another cup of coffee.
I want to drink another cup of coffee.
Knowing, I have not always made the right decision.
I didn't care if they were right or the other way around.
Nevertheless, no matter how much I have sinned,
no matter what decisions I have taken,
to die today for the sake of others
will be enough for me.
Mr. Yashotoki.
Looks like the third group has destroyed the black dobermans.
I've been waiting for this day with impatience.
What a moment.
Detective Hachikawa.
What?
Civilian rescue is the main task.
I'm scared of your actions.
What a stupid bastard.
Eliminating the black doberman is much more important than saving the old doberman,
which has not been for long.
I've been waiting for this for 10 years.
She killed my mentor and my comrades.
Or should I explain in more detail, special investigator Hirako?
You will get a good quinka.
See you in hell.
The ghouls don't get there.
What?
What?
Can people get there?
Ui.
Ready.
Attacking.
Even Ui failed.
Maruo, where is Juzo?
It will be soon.
Good evening.
Kaneki.
You have only one way.
Become stronger.
It's up to you.
I'm sorry, Kaneki.
Don't hurry, Juzo.
Juzo always attacks the block.
He can't beat Sawo.
He can't handle it.
Don't be nervous.
Mada?
You're too worried.
Just trust your feelings.
You can beat any enemy with endless attacks.
Neither your nor the enemy will move predictably.
You just need to know your guys well.
How they think, how they behave.
That's it.
Then I don't care about their movements.
When we were partners, I did exactly that.
Damn.
Could you pick a better word?
Juzo!
Don't give up.
Yeah.
Thanks to you, our plan failed.
Come on.
He saved us.
Are you going there, Kaneki?
Are you going there, Kaneki?
Juzo!
Wow!
Are we attacking together with Juzo?
Yeah.
He's attacking.
I need one more.
What are Hiraka and Mogan busy with?
One-eyed ghouls.
Are they alive?
Yeah.
They just lost their quinks.
You can't escape.
Do you think I can do it?
I'll see for myself and decide what to do next.
I'll decide what to do.
Kaneki.
You won't get away.
We've lost most of the second and third units.
There's one-eyed ghouls.
Send in the fourth unit.
Hurry up!
Let's kill the one-eyed ghoul.
Yes, sir.
Kaneki.
Hurry up!
This way.
Juzo!
Throw me at him.
Juzo!
I can't sit with my hands down anymore.
Well, Yanate.
What?
School?
Why me?
Why?
This is against the rules.
I can't sit with my hands down anymore.
That's not true.
It's against the rules.
Why me?
Eva! Do!
I'm not going to leave yet.
Hoje!
Do you want to talk to the devil's monkey?
I'm not your girlfriend. I'm going to kill you.
Do you want to talk to the devil's monkey?
I'm not your girlfriend. I'm going to kill you.
Do you want to talk to the devil's monkey?
Yukina...
I'm not your girlfriend. I'm going to kill you.
This is Shinahara.
Yes.
Kureo, I'm sorry for making you wait.
Report, Shinahara.
Please.
Monkey elimination completed.
Completed.
No!
It's you.
You're the only one who has a place in both worlds.
You're the only one who has a place in both worlds.
Let half-human, half-ghost.
If you think about it, I'd like you to save someone too.
Like my child.
I'd like you to save someone too.
Like my child.
I'd like you to save someone too.
I'd like you to save someone too.
Episode 4
This is Amon from the fourth squad.
I see one-eyed.
Let's start the elimination.
Copy that.
Be careful, Amon.
Another one?
I knew it.
One-eyed.
