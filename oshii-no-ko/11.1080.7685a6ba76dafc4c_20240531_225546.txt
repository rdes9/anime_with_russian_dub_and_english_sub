So, simple, but sour,
I can't see it with my eyes,
The truth is, it tastes like honey.
There's no such thing, no such thing,
There's no such thing, no such thing,
The type I like is ice,
So, answer me.
I don't know who I'm going to fall in love with,
I can't really tell a lie.
I fall for that kind of words again,
I make you fall in love again.
Everyone is being taken away from you,
You are a perfect, ultimate item.
I can't show myself,
I'm just a substitute.
Ah, with that smile,
I fall in love again.
Everyone is being taken away from you,
I can't really tell a lie with my eyes,
But it's a perfect love.
Great performance!
That's for sure.
And where are we going now?
I'm going home, I guess.
Ah, there she is.
I've seen such a cute girl in the locker room.
I want to see her performance.
You have a weakness for cuties.
A real otaku.
And where do they perform?
I don't know.
I don't know.
And where do they perform?
On the star stage.
Ah, in this terrible place.
It's so hot in there.
It's just awful.
Oh, boss,
maybe we should watch the next performance?
There's a meme performing.
I've heard about her somewhere.
Who is she?
She often streams on YouTube.
She's very cute and funny.
And recently she was in Love with a Star.
Ah, that's the reality.
She's now performing in the idol group Bicamachi.
Bicamachi?
Do you know them?
Now nobody knows about them.
They took the name of one of the old groups.
One of them was the legendary Ai.
She was a rising star,
but death tore her career apart.
All that's left of them is the name.
All right, we'll see.
And then we'll go home.
Bicamachi, your turn.
Yes!
There are quite a few spectators.
Although it's not surprising
who is in our group.
There are more red sticks than I expected.
I want my sticks to be red.
Just like Ai.
Then I choose the yellow ones.
What about you?
It doesn't matter.
Let it be white.
White means?
Is something wrong?
White is a special color.
People often fight for it.
Here it is.
Take it.
It suits those who don't really like idols.
It's better than I thought.
I want to feel a sweeter love.
It doesn't matter if it looks good or not.
It looks good, right?
Is that really possible?
It's all right.
When I left the stage,
I was not afraid of anything.
Almost all spectators
wave the yellow sticks.
Many came here for Memch.
Everyone wants to see her.
This is a surprise.
I'm sure everyone would be glad to see her in the center, not me.
Well, how are they with you, Vekomachi veteran?
It doesn't even look like it. This is not the Vekomachi I know.
That group lived only thanks to their star Ai.
This will not be repeated by streaming accidentally.
Star! Finale!
Take! Now! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on!
Take! Now! Star! Finale!
Cool!
Awesome!
Cool!
Boss?
Vekomachi!
How bright she shines!
Thank you very much!
She adores Aida.
You are always so energetic.
She was born to perform on stage.
People like her like a lot of people.
Already today she will have a lot of fans.
She has achieved a lot.
The hit that we all have been waiting for so long!
B-sign!
I envy them.
Everyone looks at them.
I can't take my eyes off.
No one has been paying attention to me for a long time.
My mom and manager just abandoned me.
Even my fans see only a grown-up child in me.
Someone, look at me!
I've been praying for this for more than ten years.
Tell me I need you.
How hard I would have tried!
If only someone had said these words.
Tell me I'm at least useful.
I will work hard.
Praise me for my efforts.
Hearing this, I will try even harder.
Someone!
At least someone!
Tell me I have a place here!
What a stupidity!
How can he do this with such a serious face?
You have all our flowers with you.
Do you want to say you don't have a favorite?
That's a trick.
I decided.
Until I stop being an idol,
I will make you wave only with white sticks.
I will make you love me.
I will be your favorite, your star.
I will make you love me.
I will be your favorite, your star.
I will be your favorite, your star.
Boss, the one in the middle is cool too.
In the second song, she started smiling.
They can all become real stars.
And the one in the middle not only likes otakus, but also sings well.
I'm sure they will be successful.
I'm so tired.
Oh, you came all the way.
Well, yes.
Was it you then?
It was a laugh after all.
It was a laugh after all.
Well, how do you like our performance?
Well, I think it's not bad for the first time.
What? Can't you praise more?
No, you can't.
All of you are waiting for much better concerts than this one.
So it's too early to give you a higher rating.
Okay.
It looks like the two of you have finally found common ground.
But they don't get along so well.
It's not quite the case.
Aqua, tell me, how are you doing with Akana from Love with a Star?
We haven't seen each other since the shooting ended.
What, really?
Besides, we have a working relationship.
Although we agreed on a meeting for a photo for Instagram.
Working relationship?
What else?
It looks like Kurakawa Akana would really fall in love with you.
It's just a regular show.
That's how they do it all the time.
Poor thing.
Look, don't fall in love with her without a reason.
Are you kidding me?
Or are you crazy?
Don't be sad for nothing.
All right, don't laugh.
No way.
Ayumi likes Aqua.
Akane!
One of you, help me!
Aqua!
Akane!
I have an offer for you!
What? Seriously?
Work for me?
Aqua!
We'll work together again!
So, during our trainings
you pretended to be drunk, right?
And why did you do it?
Well...
You wouldn't talk to me like that, would you?
And only because of that?
Is that the only reason?
You wore this stupid mask!
You ran and danced in it
not just for that!
When I wore it like that,
I almost got suffocated!
I...
I almost got suffocated!
And all the time I was talking like that
You have a real talent for copying!
Who would have thought?
Cool!
And?
You didn't want to hear me
What can I say about advice?
I just wanted my sister's concert to be a success
Yeah, yeah
Again with your sister's complex
What a convenient excuse
Okay, whatever you say, let it be
Again for your own
I'm leaving
What? Are you running away again?
Where are you going?
What are you talking about?
I'm not running away
You did so many weird things to talk to me
And now you're tired of it
Oh, come on
You don't seem to understand
what was really going on
Sit down, let's discuss
Okay, with pleasure
It's so good
We finally made up!
For me?
They are fighting
It's all good
My brother is not one of those
who talks to everyone in a row
If you don't push him
he will stop talking to you
But he wasn't always like that
Really?
Yeah, a lot of things happened
And now he's like that
Horrible
Together with her
That's what it used to be
Akane
You'll have to do your best
Yuhu!
My rights!
After so much time
we finally have a big project
50 million sales
and the recent movie has become a real hit
We're making a play on the Tokyo blade
Yeah, I remember it
My daughter
got hooked on manga after the anime
What kind of production?
Half three-dimensional?
Yeah, that's right
And I got such a budget for it
We're definitely going to be successful
And the hall itself is just great
We can turn the stage as we want
and add computer graphics
and completely recreate the manga
And our team is just great
Besides
I also agreed on actors
for the play with the lalalay theater
Wow, that's great
I'm surprised you convinced Kendaichi
on such a thing
It's thanks to our budget
Money in the theater world decides everything
Okay
about actors
I think from lalalay you can take
Kurakawa Akane
But given our audience
we need to find nice guys
They have a couple of suitable people
I don't think that's enough
I need help from outside
And this is your part, dear Kaburagi
Is there anyone on your mind?
How can there not be?
They are
very promising actors
I can introduce you
But I owe you
Hey Kaburagi, wait
I give your guys a chance
that doesn't often fall out
So I owe you
on the contrary
Fine
Ha ha ha
Sword in hand
Do you think it's good?
I don't know, I think it's okay
Oh great
Now the fans will definitely think
We've got enough picture for a while
I wanted to ask
Are they in contact with you?
Yes, it's about him.
He's in charge of the production of the lalalay theater company.
So I was offered a role.
The lalalay theater.
So, to help her, I introduced her to the troupe of actors from the same theater company.
Troupe?
This is the lalalay theater.
The same one that Akane is in.
Although they weren't that famous back then.
She was supposed to be in that place.
And she found her love.
Since she was there, she's been watching her appearance
and asking me about private restaurants.
I don't even know who that guy was.
But I remember how quickly her face grew.
If you want, I can introduce you to the head of the lalalay.
I think you'll be able to get closer to the answer you're looking for.
I'm going to play.
I knew it.
I was offered the role of Princess Sai.
And you're going to play Touki, right?
They're a couple in the manga.
I think they chose us on purpose.
I thought in such productions, they usually make non-traditional couples, don't you think?
There are quite a few ordinary couples in the manga.
Although many girls like such pairings.
Touki is a secondary character.
And thanks to the elements of Ramcom, he also has an admirer.
Many often argue whether he will be with the heroine or with someone else.
With someone else?
Are you talking about Tsurugi?
This role should be decided soon.
I wonder who will get it.
My role.
Arima.
Don't post the photos right away.
You may begin to spy on the fans.
Then you won't have any problems with the stalkers.
Everyone in a decent society has been posting photos for a long time.
Or do you need problems again in the right place?
You don't learn anything, Kuraka Wakana.
So you're playing Tsurugi.
How many years have we not played together?
I thought you dropped this case.
You're an idol now.
Wakana?
Why should I stand on stage and cling to a job for which they don't pay a penny?
Oh, by the way, Nitelle recently starred in a reality show.
She sold her personal life for the sake of popularity.
I'm so happy for you.
Arima.
Okay.
I was nearby, I came to warn you.
And you'd better change the place of your work date.
See you.
Are you familiar with Arima?
We're the same age.
Both of us have been in the show business since we were kids.
Of course we know each other.
But...
Will you get along with her?
I can't.
I can't.
She took all the roles I wanted year after year.
Imagine what it's like to be an actress who was born in one year with such a genius.
But this time I won't give up.
While Kana was singing her silly songs about pepper, I constantly sharpened my skills.
After so many years, I finally got a chance to take revenge.
And I won't lose.
Listen, actors, we're all the same.
I won't lose. I won't lose. I won't lose.
She sees defeat.
An actress who was called a genius in her childhood.
And the one I call a genius now.
Kaburagi decided to beat them up.
Wow.
The reenactment of the Tokyo Blade is going to be incredible.
The end
Ruby, you know, maybe you too can become an idol one day.
Akawa, will you become an actor?
I wonder what you'll be like when you grow up.
The one who made Aya go through this pain is working in the show business.
Whatever it takes, I'll find him.
And to do it, I will.
Episode 11, Idol
The End
This night sky that I ran while getting out of the car
The star that doesn't spread with the stances of the waves
Is a dream of a jewel
The tears and sweat that float are the tears of blood
If you can only swim in your eyes, it's a play
But the stage won't let you go
I always long for it
I long for it
I never see you such a life, girl
Even if you're born too late, there's no end
Who did you live for? Remember it
Because I'm risking my life
Because I'm giving it to you
You gave me a chance, didn't you?
If you can only fulfill the desires of all
If you can only do it
I want to see you
Make a wish to the stars
Come on, girls of the stars, go to sleep
If you can't see the shine
Come on, girls of the stars, go to sleep
If you can only fulfill the desires of all
If you can only do it
I want to see you
Make a wish to the stars
Come on, girls of the stars, go to sleep
If you can only fulfill the desires of all
If you can only do it
I want to see you
