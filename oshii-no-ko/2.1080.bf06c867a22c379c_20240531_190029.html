        <pre>So, simple, but sour,
I can't see the secret, but it tastes like honey.
There's no such thing as that, no, no, no.
There's no such thing as that, no, no, no.
The type I like is love, so answer me.
I don't know who I like.
I can't really know the lie.
In such words, I fall alone again.
I make you love again.
Everyone is being taken away by the eyes.
You are the ultimate item, the perfect one.
I can't show up in this world.
I'm the first to be stopped.
Ah, I love you with that smile.
Everyone is being taken away by the eyes.
Even if those words are a lie, it's a perfect love.
The famous idol group announces a number of additional participants.
Do you want to be an idol?
Come with me!
The number of applicants is 136,114 people.
This is the first written statement.
The stage is over.
The second stage is an interview.
Listening to the group.
Waiting for the results.
The number of participants in the last year is 1 to 13.
Middle school, Megurogawa.
I'm almost sure I'll get there.
Last time I didn't get the age.
I waited two whole years for this opportunity.
Yes, I'm sure you can do it.
You're cute and you dance well.
Only you sing.
But even so, this lack is easily compensated by your beauty.
Lack?
In any case, I'm sure you can do it.
And one day I, like my mom, will become the best idol.
My name is Poshinarubi.
And I have two secrets that I will not tell even to my best friends.
The first is that my mom was the legendary idol of May,
who killed a crazy fan 10 years ago.
And the second secret is that I have memories of my mom.
And the second secret is that I have memories of my past life.
Since I was born, I've been sick a lot and spent almost my whole life in the hospital.
My only joy was idols.
And most of all, I liked Aizbi Kamachi.
Even when the fire of my life went out,
the songs of Aizbi still echoed in my head.
But when I opened my eyes again,
it turned out that I was reborn as Ai's daughter.
Those years when I lived with Ai?
No, with my mom.
They were a real treasure.
I'll be just like my mom!
Dreams are good, of course, for exams to get into high school.
You don't understand anything, brother.
I'll become an idol.
High school with a creative bias is the main interview.
Exams are just a ticker.
If I become an idol, I don't have to prepare for exams.
I'll kill two birds with one stone.
Don't risk your future by clinging to one opportunity.
You can become an idol, of course,
but don't feed on false illusions.
Their salary is small and their career ends at 30.
And the fans are always watching your personal life.
The small part becomes successful,
and even then they change their job.
You still have to look for such ungrateful work.
What are you trying to say?
You have to live your life the way you want.
You think you can't achieve anything just by making money.
Some people don't get this opportunity in their whole life.
I don't want this!
Do what you want.
I'll go to the director.
My brother has changed a lot since my mother died.
He's always so gloomy,
and he never smiles.
Since he started to study directing,
he's been doing something all the time,
but he never says anything.
And he's not the only one who has changed a lot.
Ichigo couldn't continue managing the company,
and Miyako took his place.
Having lost his leader,
Bicomache collapsed two years later.
Strobury Productions no longer works with idols,
and instead develops with the help of internet talents.
Listen, maybe we should create a new idol group?
It's so easy.
I would have done it a long time ago if I could.
The dream I gave to Mai,
it's not easy to forget.
You have to remember that we actually won the lottery.
The more I work, the clearer I understand.
Miracles like this don't happen twice.
It's usually much harder to achieve such success.
Besides,
What?
No, it's nothing.
You're supposed to get the listening test results soon.
If you pass, you'll get into their company.
They're much bigger than us.
Yes, you're probably right.
Recall, listening.
In the name of the devil.
Yes?
Hello, you're Hoshinarubi, right?
Yes, I'm Hoshina.
Yes.
Yes.
I see.
I see.
I see.
I see.
I see.
I see.
I see.
Thank you.
We'll wait for your request next time.
Ruby.
I didn't pass.
It's okay.
It happens.
There's a lot of corruption in this business.
You can't even expect honest ratings of your abilities.
Not many people get it as easy as Y.
Gotanda.
Gotanda Studio.
Thank you, director.
If you were able to fool your sister,
that means you have acting talent.
But what are you going to do if she calls?
I've already sent them a request from Ruby's face
without her phone.
And I've blocked their numbers.
I've thought it through.
And I still don't understand.
Why do you have to break the dreams of your own sister?
She's pretty cute.
She has all the chances.
That's enough.
I won't let Ruby become an idol.
She won't walk on Ai's feet.
Not at all.
You're taking too much care of her.
You have a sister complex.
You'd better be alone.
I'm alone.
I'll take care of everything.
Have you been offered a job?
Yes.
In one of the underground groups.
What if it's not destiny?
I've been watching such ads on the set for a long time.
Mom was invited to the group too.
I feel like someone's guiding me.
Are those idols' names?
Not suspicious at all.
Nothing like that.
And the contract.
At least read it carefully.
I was invited to watch their performance
and then discuss the terms of the contract.
I can't wait.
Damn it.
I'm thinking about what to do with it again.
It's your fault again.
I understand
your desire to protect your sister from the fate of Ai
after what happened to her.
I understand.
You know, I...
I still sometimes think
how it could have been
if I did it here or there.
I don't want it to happen again.
I raised Ruby like my own daughter.
I'll protect her at any cost.
But that's why
I can't just ignore Ruby's feelings.
Every day she looks more and more like Ai.
Unfortunately, I don't like her.
I don't like her.
I don't like her.
I don't like her.
But she looks more and more like Ai.
Unfortunately, she has all the traits I need.
I knew this would happen.
Whether it's for the better or not,
I still have to do something.
I'll pay the company a visit.
What?
He got something on his mind.
Hello.
May I come in for a minute?
Let me introduce myself.
What? Strawberry Productions?
Have you heard of them?
Of course! You're the agent of Beka Matcha, aren't you?
My mom is a fan!
Wow!
What a Strawberry Productions!
Your agent is so young!
I thought he was up to something bad.
His plans are already a nightmare.
I want to find out
what kind of group Ruby is interested in.
What kind of group Ruby is interested in.
I want to find out
what kind of group Ruby is interested in.
There are a lot of different groups.
If the management is bad,
there's nothing to say.
We can discuss it with Ruby later.
We can discuss it with Ruby later.
Lala, you're working
with Irina, aren't you?
Yes!
We can offer you better conditions than they do.
Could you tell us
about your contract?
Let's see.
Where do you get the money?
For my group's concert.
Besides, I get extra money
depending on the amount of the photos
and the meeting with the fans.
That's my main income.
Besides, I get paid
for my costumes.
I also get paid for my makeups.
Usually, I get one hundred thousand
a month.
Do the groups have any comments?
Of course they do!
They have a lot!
I think it's all because they meet with the manager.
Terrible.
She sings badly.
And she's not as beautiful as she used to be.
In addition, she steals from foreign fans, pretending to love them.
Although I try my best, the management does not take me seriously.
Besides, the mood in the team is terrible.
Some will leave here and there.
And I also heard that they are looking for new idols.
Therefore, if I perform at your place ...
There are those who really manage idol groups well.
But most simply do it out of love for idols and do not think about management.
Although, of course, it is not a fact that everything she said is true.
To start conflicts in the group, together with dissatisfaction with the managers,
often generates different rumors.
And it's just insanely difficult to pick up a friendly group of young girls.
Even in Bicomatch, when Ice became popular, she was called a lover.
One thought is bad.
In any case, I cannot allow Ruby to join such a team.
And what are you going to do?
We have many options.
You can spread information online.
Are you kidding me?
I'm not kidding.
I will not allow Ruby to become an idol.
At least not in an unreliable company.
By the way, what do you think? Do you want to hire that girl?
You know, we no longer do idols.
Besides, I will not hire someone who responds badly to his colleagues.
I'm sorry, I'll go.
Thank you for the job.
Very cute.
On a day like this, you have to look at all the tables.
I can't wait!
Ruby, are you sure about this?
You understand that the world you want to enter is very cruel.
Sales can be low, and you hate everything.
And not only money, even personal life.
Yes, I know.
Aqua told me a bunch of times about this.
And stalking is not uncommon these days.
But you still ...
Believe me!
I finally got a chance!
I can become an idol!
I will be like my mother!
Are you sure?
Absolutely!
Then don't join their group.
What?
Why?
I want to become an idol!
If you want this, join us.
For the first time in the last 10 years,
Strobe Reproductions will create a new group.
Now put the seal here.
Seal?
I don't really understand, but I'll do it.
Great! Congratulations!
Now you're a member of Strobe Reproductions.
If you make it, we'll see you in court.
I'm scared!
I'm not kidding.
This is necessary to get into performing arts.
So don't be angry, Aqua.
No, I'm not against it.
Aqua, darling, I'm glad to see you!
The director is not sleeping.
He's drinking! Come on, wake him up!
It's time!
Will you have dinner with us today?
No, I don't want to cause any inconvenience.
Oh, it's you.
Good morning.
Be kind, edit this.
Okay.
I'm still in middle school,
so I can't officially work.
But I can gain experience here.
The director allowed me to help him with the films.
Now I'm someone like his student.
I see.
So your sister will become an idol after all.
Do you agree with that, older brother?
It's better that way than she will perform.
Who knows where and with whom.
The family will be more reliable after all.
So your brother and sister will go to show business?
It's not like that.
I prefer to work behind the scenes.
So you don't want to play after all.
You were going to go to the same school with her.
It's all about acting.
I'm into general education.
When you asked me to be your student,
your face was screaming that you wanted to be an actor.
For me, it's just a means of achieving the goal.
To find the killer, Ai.
To find our father and make him go through the pain
through which Ai went through.
Ironically, the key to him lies in me.
I can find him with the DNA test of hair.
But for that,
I need to get as close as possible to the actor.
The easiest way for them to become themselves.
I'm going to play secondary roles.
The role of the manager is enough.
Let my roles be in the movies.
They were small.
I still understood some of that.
I don't have an acting talent.
Many people can't do anything.
No matter how hard they try,
I'm one of those people.
In me, unlike Ai, there is nothing special.
There's no point in hoping for what you can't achieve.
If even children don't dream, then who can?
You still have a lot of time.
It's too early to make your dreams come true.
Listen to the guy who has been dreaming for the last 20 years.
I'll tell you just once, listen carefully.
Everyone has the right to a dream.
Not to win the lottery, not to buy...
Next!
Dinner is ready!
Mom!
I said important things!
How do I know what you're doing here?
If I just wait, the soup will get cold.
I'll come when I'm done, okay?
I had a hard time with you.
As always.
Again you made a mess here.
It's a nightmare.
Get out of here!
How did you grow up?
Hey, aren't you already over 40?
Isn't it time to leave your parents?
Why should I leave a spacious apartment in the center?
There are so many people like me!
It's okay for the creators!
In any case, you can't win the lottery without buying a ticket.
It's strange to hear this from a man who lives with his mother.
I used to really think that I had a talent that was comparable to Aya's.
But unlike Aya and me...
That's enough, Aya!
I'm sick of it!
You're right, Aya was good.
She really has a special talent.
However, you will never become Aya, and she, in turn, will be you.
Did Aya have 10 years of experience in cinema like you?
Was she as smart as you?
Don't be afraid of one or two failures.
Give up only when you try everything and fail everywhere.
It's too early to make a middleman out of yourself.
You want to be an actor, don't you?
It's written on your face.
Will you become an actor?
Tell me, director.
I...
How, dear, are you going to eat with us?
Let me pour you a soup.
I wanted to say something important.
Why did you come in?
How should I know?
This is Yota's senior school.
It's one of the few schools where there is a course in performing arts.
And not everyone can come here.
It is necessary to provide evidence of working with the agency.
I'm Hoshino Ruby from Trobury Productions.
I'm Hoshino Aquamarine.
That's an unusual name.
A standardized score of 70.
That's enough for me.
I really liked the school.
Did you really like it so much?
So, how was it?
I think it's all good.
What about you?
No problem.
If I fail, it's only because of my name.
Yes, Hoshino Aquamarine sounds, of course, and doesn't speak.
Although you can't pronounce it, so you're just an aqua.
Aqua?
Hoshino Aqua?
Aqua? Aqua?
Are you really Hoshino Aqua?
Who are you?
Oh, I remembered.
A brilliant child who can lick all the soda.
A brilliant child who can make anyone cry.
We were in a movie together.
I'm a fisherman.
Oh, I see.
I'm a fisherman.
I'm a fisherman.
I'm a fisherman.
A fisherman!
Soon we'll meet each other again.
You come in for performing arts?
I'm so happy.
I thought you stopped playing.
We finally met.
Are you going to perform too, right?
No, I'm performing at the play-based department.
Why?
This is the last chance for me, my toes are still dancing
This night sky is full of tears, the stars are longing for the jewels
The tears and sweat are like blood, the only thing I can see is a play
But the stage won't let me go, I'll always be longing
I'll never see you such a liar
Even if I'm born too late, there's no such thing
The light is on, and the light is here in the world
I remember who I lived with
Because I'll bet my life on it, because I'll give it to you
You gave me a chance, didn't you?
I'll never see you such a liar
Even if I'm born too late, there's no such thing
The light is on, and the light is here in the world
I remember who I lived with
Because I'll bet my life on it, because I'll give it to you
You gave me a chance, didn't you?
Come on, stars, go to sleep
