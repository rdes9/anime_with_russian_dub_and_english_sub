That's right, I'm bold, but I can't see clearly
The secret is the taste of honey
There's no such thing, no such thing, no such thing
The type I like, love me, come on, answer me
I don't know who I'm going to fall in love with
I really don't know lies
I fall in love again with those words
I make you fall in love again
Everyone takes their eyes away from me
You are the ultimate partner, the perfect one
I can't show up, I'm the most beautiful in the world
I fall in love with your smile
Everyone falls in love with you
Even if those eyes, those words are a lie
It's a perfect love
I want to leave for the show
What?
In the middle of the season?
But why? What happened?
Lately, I've been often teased by boys at school
They say, so here are the guys you like
No, nothing is worse than showing your feelings to the whole world
I can't stand it, I can't stand it
I can't stand it, I can't stand it
You were right, so all women falling in love can't be the eyes they take away from me
I made you fall in love with the word
I made you fall for me
Ignore the words, ignore them
Ignore the words, ignore them
Ignore the words, ignore them
Ignore the words, never see the words again
Ignore it, ignore it
Ignore the words, ignore it
Please, don't say that. Stay with us.
But I...
Wow, how will it all end?
I think she's going to leave. Yuki is very vulnerable.
But if she leaves, what will happen to Nobu?
Look, they wrote an entire article!
What do you think?
Did I interest the viewers?
Yes, probably.
So you're not going to leave?
Huh? I can't leave?
I have a contract signed.
So it turns out you just played?
No, what are you talking about?
Doctors like you are still very far away from me.
I can't even play.
I just slightly embellished my feelings.
They really made fun of me at school.
And I also thought about leaving.
Besides, these shootings are always so early.
I really want to sleep.
I understand. You're not lying, you're just exaggerating.
Exaggerating?
After spending some time here, I began to understand
what kind of people are around me.
There are talents.
Someone doesn't even have to pretend.
And also those who almost don't get screen time.
Aqua, let's go have a snack when we're done.
No, thanks, I'll eat at home.
Come on, let's go together.
The meme said it would be a treat.
What? I didn't say that.
I heard that recently you have more subscribers.
You share the revenue with the agency in half.
What? Really? I have 80 by 20.
I wish I had that.
Captain! One more super big portion!
Eat it all, you bastards!
Hooray!
Aqua, here, I prepared it, take it.
I can fry it myself, don't worry about me.
You haven't eaten anything all this time.
No, I just don't eat meat.
That's why in places like this I never let go of my hands.
At first I often burned the meat and everyone was upset,
but now I'm good at it.
That's the thing.
Now everyone needs something more extreme.
So I have to go on a risk.
As long as I have the means.
Yeah, that's pretty good, you had a snack.
I'm sure in the company of beauties the meat is even more delicious, right?
We just talked.
You're lying! It's written on your face!
That's not true.
Look into my eyes!
With such a young body you can eat as much food as you want.
I'm happy.
We always have dinner together on Sundays,
and because of this show you are not at home all the time.
They say that you communicate after school,
but shooting is always on weekends.
It's a complete deception!
What's the difference?
In general, I'm glad they let us study.
And by the way, there are very few settings here.
Some of them, of course, play,
but the rest just want to show themselves on the good side.
Everyone does the same in life.
Take at least the same group dates.
I haven't been to them, so I don't know.
So everyone falls in love for real?
I think it's all different.
I don't believe it myself, but I do.
There are so many people watching our show,
I wouldn't want to go too far.
Well, of course!
After all, our show is still a club of flowers!
When I'm being filmed, I'm completely immersed in work,
so no.
In no way is this work for me.
I'm always honest with everyone,
and if it gets to the wedding, it will be great!
I don't know.
After all, to play my part, I have to spend so much effort.
I've never seen things like this before,
so I can't say for sure.
Nevertheless, I don't think they're just making a bet on realism.
Surprisingly, everything is real here.
All the true feelings of the actors
show much more often than I expected.
You're so sad!
Isn't it good that there's no script?
For the audience, it may be so,
but for us, a lie is the best way to protect yourself.
Okay, I don't have anything to worry about.
Now, all eyes are fixed on the relationship
between Yoki Sumi and Kumano Nobuyuki.
Kengo pretended to be jealous.
That's how a love triangle appeared in the show.
When Yoki took the lead,
she significantly revived the series,
thanks to which he became popular among the senior students.
Aqua, don't you want to join the fight for Yuki?
If you want to be popular,
it's better to try than to sit here with me.
Okay, fine. I'll just wait for the end of the show.
That's not very ambitious.
Well, aren't you going to interfere?
I'm okay with a simple role,
a light-minded cutie.
Well, I don't know.
I'm okay with a simple role,
a light-minded cutie.
Besides, my goal is to attract more subscribers to the channel.
But if you're really interested in me,
it's a completely different story.
Don't even hope.
Although, it's not worth worrying about us.
At the most closed gates of Oji,
Sho Labaraki Doji was holding five boiled chestnuts.
The famous Rai...
Manager...
Do you want me to fire you?
I watched the popular show where Akane is shot.
And what is it?
She doesn't even have 10 minutes of screen time.
They gave her no chance, no point.
One of our managers has to set her up.
But, Director, Akane is trying...
You can't make money with simple efforts.
Of all those who dreamed of such an opportunity,
I chose her.
Make her remember at least something.
I'm sorry, Manager.
You heard everything.
I know you're putting yourself out there.
Don't worry.
I promise I'll protect you.
It's all because I'm such a loser.
I have to work harder...
to make people notice me.
The juice is awful.
I'll tweet about it to get my money back.
I recently bought a new juice and it's awful.
What are you doing?
You tell me what you're doing.
You almost insulted a product of a large company.
How are we going to find sponsors?
What's the matter with them?
That's why I hate newcomers.
If you write something about the product,
it will see at least five people from the company.
And you won't get any more offers from them.
Don't exaggerate.
By the way, do you do egosurfing?
No.
Give me your phone!
Give it back!
Okay, let's see.
You're only looking for yourself.
Come on.
You even called yourself a cutie.
Do you really want to be called that?
No one recognizes you in egosurfing.
You know what?
9 out of 10 idols read everything about themselves.
For example, at parties after a performance.
And musicians and actors love egosurfing
and making fun of each other.
We live in the golden age of egosurfing.
Before, only advertisers owned such information.
And now anyone can look at any statistics.
The online advertising market has caught up with advertising in reality
and now it costs 2 trillion yen.
Now no one cares about online marketing.
And those who forget about online marketing
are left behind.
Fans and content that they consume are closely linked.
And in show business, we have this content.
But don't forget, if you look at the abyss for a long time,
then the abyss will start looking at you.
I have to try.
What are you doing?
I'm shooting videos for accounts on Twitter and TikTok.
Really?
Recently, there are more subscribers.
Although, since I'm here, it's not surprising.
By the way, you were a TikToker at first.
Yeah, but then there was no monetization and donations,
so I decided to switch to YouTube.
You should also try aqua.
I don't like these new things, so no.
How old are you?
Nobu, let's go with me.
Akane is persistent today.
I already forgot about her.
Akane, or what's her name?
I think, or without her, nothing would have changed.
What if they removed Akane and invited a handsome guy?
What to do to stand out?
Try to play the villain and steal Nobu.
If it works out, they will definitely notice you and remember you.
Although, it's up to you to listen to me or not.
But still, such moves often lead to success.
I have to try.
Wow, beautiful!
My sister taught me.
She is engaged in manicure.
So well, it turned out.
Akane, can I do it with you?
Sit down.
Yeah.
Okay.
Akane.
Akane.
Akane.
Akane.
Akane, Akane, Akane, Akane.
Akane, Akane.
Akane.
Akane.
Akane.
Akane.
Akane.
Good.
Akane, does something bother you?
Reality show will end soon.
I understand your feelings.
No, that's not the point.
I just want to stand out.
But I won't let you.
I will fight to remind you of me.
So don't hold back.
Yuki is so different from me.
I must be brighter than she is.
So, and then...
Kengo!
You like the lab, don't you?
That's where the big one came from!
Really?
I can't give up.
For myself and for those who believe in me.
Let's go!
Enough!
2 years later
You're always clingy to the guys!
Where's your pride?
Cut!
The scarf!
Get the scarf!
Quickly!
We'll continue shooting later.
She's got a cover shoot tomorrow.
No.
No.
I didn't want to.
Akane!
No!
Akane!
I'm fine.
Calm down.
I understand everything.
You were too nervous.
I know how hard you're trying.
You wanted to justify your expectations.
That's why you're doing what you don't like.
You didn't know what to do yourself.
I'm sorry.
You have a photo shoot tomorrow.
Everything's fine.
A photo shoot can easily take away such a small thing.
It won't work at work.
Akane, do you hate me?
No, why are you...
You're so strong and kind.
I admire you.
Me too.
Akane, you're so hard-working.
You never give up.
That's why I'm not angry.
Really?
They don't shoot us.
Why would I lie to you?
If it happened at school,
it would be a small thing that everyone would forget.
But even if they had already made up...
It's just a top hat.
What the hell is wrong with her?
Poor Yuki.
I knew she was inadequate.
I can't believe she raised her hand on Yuki.
But she...
The Internet doesn't forget anything.
I knew it would be like that.
I thought that if I apologized,
people would forgive me.
Because of the contract,
I can't tell you that I didn't get on the screen.
But I apologized,
and as best I could,
I explained everything to you.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
But my problem is that I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
What should I do?
50 people are talking about someone טוב
and you're still alive.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I said I'm sorry.
And if you're sorry,
you're apologizing.
And what if I'm not and angry?
It's an ordinary thing, but it's the worst thing you can do on the Internet.
I made a mistake and deserved all this.
That's what they think of me.
I can't turn back.
I've read absolutely everything they wrote about me.
Poison on the Internet is the most painful thing for sensitive people.
So it's better not to read it all.
Because otherwise these comments are perceived too seriously.
When I close my eyes, I can't think of anything else.
I forced myself to sleep,
convincing myself that in the morning it will be easier for me.
But it didn't happen.
Akane, are you okay? You look pale.
Everything is fine.
Maybe you'll stay at home today?
I'm fine. I'm going to school.
Did you hear what Akane did?
I'm going crazy, but I didn't expect anything else.
She keeps saying that Poe is at work.
She's like a star.
Exactly, she won't calm down without showing that she's better than us.
What else, bastard?
She wants to say that she's not like everyone else.
I'm sure she's being consoled by a whole crowd of guys.
Don't say that.
Akane, you look pale. What happened?
Is something wrong at work?
No.
People like her are born with a bad upbringing.
A bad mother gives birth to a even worse daughter.
It's a closed circle.
I'm sorry, Mom.
It will be better if you don't write anything yet.
Everything you write will just pour oil into the fire.
It's better to discuss everything with me first.
When the new series was released,
I couldn't even make myself watch it.
But the criticism spread even more.
That's why I figured out what they showed in the series.
And I realized that while the series is going on,
no one will forget what happened and the criticism will continue.
And that it will follow me until the very end of my career.
Yes, I've known her for a long time.
She's always behaved like she's different from everyone else.
But she considers herself some kind of genius.
I don't think she cares about other people's feelings.
I think she's just pretending to be good.
I'm sure. Until no one sees it.
She's laughing at us together with someone like her.
And on her face it's like it's written.
The world is spinning around me.
She's from a wealthy family.
I'm sure she's never worked before.
Does anyone really like her?
No matter how hard she tries, it's useless.
She probably doesn't have any friends.
Her character is disgusting.
She can't get along with anyone.
She's just an idiot, playing a mindless role.
She's surrounded by guys and makes noise as soon as she doesn't like something.
I'm sure she's never put her soul into anything.
There's a whole bunch of people like her.
Where should I look?
You don't understand anything.
You don't have a place here anymore.
The End
Akane is the girl that everyone is talking about.
She played the main role in the lalalay show.
She's a real hard worker.
But seeing how she is, I realized that she's just a show to sell better.
I used to support her, but now I don't think I will.
The End
I was in middle school with Akane.
Everyone hated her.
In short, she's just a terrible person.
Her career on TV is over.
No one will hire someone who's going to hurt other actors.
By the way, she's a real bitch.
Just like a real villain.
Goodbye, Akane.
I'm afraid we won't see you again on TV.
Anonymous. Just die.
How are you, Akane? Did you eat today?
Juicy. I didn't eat anything at all.
The End
I'm so tired.
I'm tired of these thoughts.
I just don't want to think about it.
No! Let me go!
Calm down!
I'm not an enemy.
Please, calm down.
