That's right, it's simple, but it's sour
I can see it, but I can't see it
The secret is the taste of honey
There's no such thing, no such thing
There's no such thing, no such thing
The type I like is the other person
Come on, answer me
I don't know who I'm going to fall in love with
I don't know if it's a lie or if it's true
In such words, I fall alone again
I make you fall in love again
Everyone is being taken away
You are imperfect, the ultimate idol
I can't show up anymore
The first star is reborn
Ah, with that smile, I fall in love
Everyone is being taken away
Even if those eyes, those words are a lie
It's a perfect love
The first star is reborn
In the previous series,
entering the school for celebrities,
we met an old friend
Are you also entering?
On the acting school?
No, I'm at the general school
But why?
Sister enters the acting school,
and I just worry about her
What?
My brother has a terrible complex of sisters
Horrible?
You know, to be honest, I never liked her
If they accept you, you will become her kahaim
Yeah, you're right
I actually hear everything
Okay, let's not fight
Well, let's be friends, Loli Senpai
Repeat it again, I'll finish it
Okay, for now, I'm going to the director
Oh, bye
Wait
Hey, listen
Where are you going?
Who is this director?
By the way, where do you live now?
Listen, I'm talking to you
What school did you go to?
What are you doing?
How long will you follow me?
Until you tell me everything
Are you still filming?
No, not anymore
Oh, I see
Okay, since it's all
Wait, let's talk more
Maybe you want to go to karaoke together?
No, I don't want to
Well, maybe then to me?
It's a very unusual way to get closer
What else can I do?
You know that I'm famous
I can't just go and chat in some cafe
And other places where you can go alone are closed now
I see
Well, if that's the case
Oh, Arima Kana
I haven't seen you for a long time
How did you grow up?
I'm still playing
Although with my success in childhood
I don't care
What? Feel like home
Wow
Listen, Aqua
If you don't play anymore
Then why are you going to the director?
Isn't he going to teach you acting?
Yes, he taught me the basics
But now I work behind the scenes
As someone like an assistant
That's how it is
But I'm still glad
It's good that you're still in show business
Who wants to add?
No, thank you
I'm on a diet right now
But you have to eat to grow
Then you eat
What?
Better
Yes, it's amazing
What?
I would never have thought
That you still live with your mother
And you don't seem to have learned
To show respect to your elders
I don't know
My parents moved out of town
That's why I live alone now
And I have to order food all the time
Is it too expensive?
It's okay
Thanks to my work in childhood
I have a lot of money now
Damn rich
Listen, director
Do you have any records left
And documents?
I don't know
I don't know
Director, do you have any records left
For the shoot?
I think they're somewhere
But don't show it
It's a part of the past that I want to forget
I thought I had talent
That's why I ruined the movie
I heard it myself
If you want to see it
Try to talk about it
Yes, please
Never
By the way
I'm shooting somewhere in the main role
I have a couple of free roles
Do you want me to make an agreement
To take you?
No
What?
What kind of series is it?
Today will be sweet
One series per show
Yes
Sweet today?
Yes, did you hear?
Well, anyone who works in show business
And says they don't know is lying
The series is too famous
Are you interested?
I told you
I'm not shooting anywhere else
If I make an agreement
They'll give you a very good role
Our director Kaburagi
Is crazy about me
Kaburagi?
You mean Kaburagi Masaya?
Yes, why?
After Aya's death
Three phones were left
One of them was working, the other was personal
They had the numbers of the group members
And the agency
Although Aya seemed
Light-minded
She was extremely careful
And protected the secret from us
The problem was
In the third phone
Aya used it
Until pregnancy
The phone was very old
Finding a new battery
Was a very difficult task
But it was nothing compared
To breaking the password
With every unsuccessful attempt
I had to wait 30 seconds
And I didn't even know how many numbers were in it
In half a day
I tried a hundred passwords
In a month
Only a thousand
Day by day
Day by day
Day by day
And here's the 45,510th attempt
But it took
Four long years
To break the password
It contained
Phone numbers and emails
Of hundreds of people connected to the show business
And among them was he
Kaburagi Masaya
Well, agree
By the way, almost all the actors are our peers
And the main character has a girlish face
So cute
I agree
By the way, the situation on the site is problematic
Get ready for it
Okay
I'll go
I'll go
I'll go
I'll go
I'll go
I'll go
I'll go
I'll go
I'll go
I'll go
I'll go
Are you ready for this?
He plays since childhood?
Yes
Uh-huh
He's nice
Okay
If he's recommended to be such a good actor
As you are, then, of course, we'll take him
Okay
Then, see you
The roles are fixed?
Huh?
Yes
It doesn't matter who takes the role
What? Ako will be in the series?
Why did you tell her?
Sam, you would never have told her.
And it's our duty to tell the audience about the projects.
Mom was right.
She said that one day I would become an idol for that actor.
So you still haven't forgotten about it, have you?
So none of that has anything to do with it.
I just want to meet the director, because he was familiar with Ai, and take his hair from him.
Ai's dream of becoming an actor, I didn't even think about such nonsense.
What's the name of the show?
Today is going to be sweet.
It's being filmed in a manga studio.
Oh, I know, it's going to be sweet today.
It's in Aqua's room, it's a wonderful manga.
Don't take things without demand.
It's being filmed by the new internet channel.
There will be six episodes, and three have already been released.
The cast is almost all newbies.
It looks like something low budget.
Aqua got the role of the villain from the last episode.
Just for you, with such a scary face.
Stop it.
It's being shown on the internet, so we can watch it.
Oh, come on.
I hate people.
Everyone only thinks about themselves.
Oh, Lulisenpai.
Ai, listen.
Huh?
Do you like to walk with such a face?
What do you want?
Nothing.
What's wrong with you?
I was just chasing a cat, and then I ran into you.
What nonsense.
You see, you have a much bigger smile.
Don't tease me like that.
Be honest with yourself.
Ai, you!
Hands off my girl!
Do you need anything?
Please, guys, don't.
Please don't fight.
Was it sweet today so bad?
Yes, it seems that the feelings were different.
It's not so bad.
I wouldn't say that it's impossible to watch.
But why do they spend so much time on their characters?
They wanted to show all their actors, so they made new roles.
And the plot in the manga was a little different.
When you try to push in a 14-part series,
some moments will inevitably have to be cut out.
And the actors are here.
It seems that many of them have no experience.
But it's terrible!
You're straightforward yourself.
By the way, didn't Lolli Senpai play better before?
Karaoke
Oh, come on!
Did she really say that?
That's it, she's done!
And you, as before, have a strange tongue.
I'll save my reputation, so listen.
And it's not easy to find a senior with my level of play.
Then why is everything so bad here?
This series is aimed at the female audience and attracts the audience with handsome guys.
So they decided to show all their models.
The ability to play secondary.
But not to take good actors would be a failure.
Therefore, they took someone who already knows how to play, that is, me.
But even so, your game was weak.
But I have to hold back!
All the actors around me are absolutely terrible!
Beautiful legs.
People need each other to become stronger.
Oh, complain.
Of all the actors in this unfortunate team, only I know how to play!
Just imagine if I had a full game.
Their game would be like a pizza with good cheese on a terrible ham.
Pizza?
When I play, I try my best.
Who likes to spoil their work on purpose?
But good games and good shows are different things.
Of course, such a game was always necessary to improve sales.
But who will watch such a series?
When Mangaka came to shoot the first episode,
her disappointment was limitless.
But the film crew and actors are still trying.
We do everything to make the audience and manga fans like the series.
I want them to at least watch it.
And for that I have to play worse.
Even if it spoils your reputation?
The most important thing for an actor is communication skills.
In the past, I pushed my talent into everyone's face.
Yes, I made good money, but in the end I lost almost everything.
Therefore, when my best days passed, everyone forgot about me.
There were children who played better than me.
I realized how important it was for them to call me, despite this.
I realized how important communication is.
Now it's very easy to work with me.
I decided that the quality of the film received is more important than anything else.
Therefore, I have been working with the director Kaburagi for a long time.
He called me here because he knows that I will do what I need.
So, in the end, you still learned to make a deal.
Yes, I grew up.
In addition, in appearance, I am almost no less than this model.
Isn't there less self-confident actors?
No matter how it is, the shooting is already tomorrow,
and the series will be released in a week.
The series will be processed immediately after the shooting.
Tomorrow there will be rehearsals right away, and then there will be shooting.
Well, what is your schedule?
The guy complained about everything to you, and then he left.
This is where the mess comes from.
The role is not the most attractive.
That's why I was able to push you through.
The role is through communication, the passage to reading the script.
Well, nothing new.
After all, when we were little, you were terribly angry.
Oh, memories.
This time I did it all.
What a bad girl I grew up.
It's nothing funny.
But now I understand what the director felt.
You already understood why I asked you.
I don't care if I'm called a bad actress.
Please, let's make this series together good.
I believe it's possible with you.
A hopeless project with terrible actors.
But after listening to Kana and thinking about it,
I realized that the characters were changed so that they would suit the actors.
I saw the techniques that the director used to make the series good,
despite the bad game.
The shooting group is great.
By the way, the main character is not a talented actress.
It seems that this can work.
Usually the actors read the script together,
and then they start rehearsing.
With us in the rehearsal, the directors edit the script.
Then they check all the cameras and complete the whole series before shooting.
However, I heard that this place is free only today.
Therefore, everything from rehearsal to shooting will have to be done in a day.
Practicing will not work.
Even my director is preparing better.
We have neither time nor money.
Hello, Kana.
What's the weather today?
They should have moved the shooting.
The roof, of course, leaks, but it's not scary.
It's so wet here.
The hairstyle is spoiled.
Besides, the place is terrible here.
By the way, let me introduce you.
This is our actor for the role of a stalker.
I'm Aqua. I'll be glad to meet you.
What's wrong with him?
I didn't even introduce myself.
This is Naoroshi Mameo, the main character.
But he has not yet grown up.
For young stars like him, this is normal.
I feel bad about these words.
But such a career and such projects educate us.
We become more polite, better, and make fewer mistakes.
Therefore, we have a lot of work proposals.
In short, acquaintance is also an important part of work.
Go ahead!
Nice to meet you.
I'm Aqua from Strawberry Productions.
I'll be glad to work with you.
Yeah, me too.
Kaburagi Masaya
He's somehow related to Hoshino Ai.
He could be my father's son-in-law,
as well as the culprit of the death of Ai.
I have to find out who he is.
He is responsible for the entire shooting site.
His orders are transferred to the site through the director.
He has a lot of connections with modeling agencies,
so he picked up the actors.
In general, appearance is the most important thing for him.
It helped you get the role.
Let's start the rehearsal!
Let's do it!
Let's go!
I'm playing a stalker watching over the heroine.
Isn't it ironic?
To play a stalker like the killer of Ai.
And... start!
The End
Break!
Water is running down here.
Let's speed up the camera so we don't get wet in the next scene.
You know how to play!
You said it's better to be a stalker.
With this role, anyone could do it.
I'm not so bad at getting in the way of others,
but I don't have the charisma.
The game that Ari Makano saw that day
was only because of the age gap between my body and mind.
Now, when my body has grown, I'm just a vulnerable actor.
If you expected more from me, I'm sorry.
Don't say that.
I'd lie if I said I didn't want anything better.
But that's enough.
Your game seems like you've been working on it for a long time.
And I like it.
All those tricks you used during the game,
as if you forgot who you are and completely got into the story.
It's a pity that ordinary people don't understand it.
Only experienced actors like us are concerned about such things.
Don't you need to calm me down?
Of course I do.
I'm responsible for all the actors.
I got the lead role for the first time in 10 years.
I'll try my best.
You're right.
I haven't seen you in a long time, and I was even surprised that you were still playing.
Yeah, I haven't filmed anywhere for a long time.
I couldn't find a job.
Everyone thought I left cinema.
But I kept training anyway.
I didn't know why I was trying so hard,
and I even thought about finishing my career.
But still, my skills have finally been recognized.
And I'm so happy that I decided not to give up.
So even if you're not the best actor,
I'm glad to know that you didn't give up all this time.
Now I know that in this world filled with darkness,
there was someone who fought with me.
That's enough.
How much time is left until the end of the break?
I was able to do it after filming the photoshoot.
Everything is almost ready.
By the way, Arima holds the spirit of the cast well.
Ah, Kana.
It's very easy and pleasant to work with her.
She's ready for anything for the sake of praise.
It's very convenient for her to agree to any role.
Besides, her name is Arima Kana.
It's pretty well known to the public.
Since she left the agency, she can be taken for free,
and her name gives advertising.
Great deal.
It's a pity that she's only talking about the quality of the game.
This show is only needed for entertainment.
The game is not interesting to us at all.
It seems that she just doesn't understand it.
I'm so happy that my skills have finally been recognized.
Is this recognition?
The world is so cruel, Arima Kana.
You rarely get what you deserve.
I got what I came for.
My goal has been achieved.
However...
Are we going to continue filming?
Since Arima Kana has left the agency,
since I'm still here,
I'm going to do my best.
Arima Kana
Arima Kana
Arima Kana
