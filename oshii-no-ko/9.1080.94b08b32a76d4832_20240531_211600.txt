That's right, it's simple, but it's sour
I can see it, but I can't see it
The secret is the taste of honey
There's no such thing, no such thing
There's no such thing, no such thing
The type I like is A.I.Z.
Now, answer me
I don't know who I'm going to fall in love with
I don't know if it's a lie or the truth
In such words, I fall alone again
I make you fall in love again
Everyone is being taken away
You are a perfect and ultimate A.I.Z.
I can't show up anymore
The first star is reborn
Ah, with that smile
I love you
Everyone is being taken away
Even if those eyes and those words are a lie
It's a perfect love
Strobe Reproductions
Website
And why haven't I hired you as a recruiter yet?
Famous YouTuber and blogger, meme
Are you surprised that you want to become an idol?
370,000 subscribers on YouTube
And 638,000 followers on TikTok
You are pretty well known
But I have to ask, what agency do you work with?
Well, I'm a streamer, so I'm pretty independent from them
And now I work with a company E-Forum
But this is not an exclusive contract, we are rather just partners
According to our contract, I can take any job I want
I see
In this case, your idol activity will be engaged in Strobe Reproductions
We have a lot of similar people, so it's not a problem to sign such a contract
Well, one problem has been solved
But apparently, there is something else you want to say
Okay, I guess what it is
So, are you lying about your age?
You got married
Yeah, judging by the figure, it may seem that you are young
But you can't fool me like that
Well, it's okay
Many celebrities get married at their age for several years
You don't have to worry
What? Really? That's good
Well, how old are you?
Well, kind of, to be honest
Yeah, yeah
How old are you?
I'm sorry, I was already asked
You say you are 18, so you must say very boldly
No, don't count
And how much does it matter? Three years?
Twice more
You are not that close
So you are 24?
Right, well, that is, it was last spring
So you are 25
I could just say
They pretend to be a senior at this age
What were you thinking?
I had one reason
I always dreamed of being an idol
I grew up with my mom and two younger brothers
So I wanted to find a job as soon as possible
But mom said
Don't worry, follow your dream
I will try too
After that, I started listening
I even went to a large organization
But in the third year of high school
Mom worked again and ended up in the hospital
We needed money
So I left school and worked in different places
Thanks to this, my brothers were able to study
And my mom got better
But by that time I was already 23
In show business, those who are older than 20 are considered old
And if you are older than 20, there is no chance of even getting into listening
When I finally had the opportunity to follow my dream, it was already too late
Once this path was closed, I decided to start streaming
Then I didn't finish high school yet
So I decided to call myself a senior
It turned out even better than I expected
So many people signed up for me
And then it was too late to admit
This has been going on for two years
Until this day
Now you will probably refuse
I lied for seven years
If someone finds out, you will have a problem
What kind of idol 25 am I?
I don't care
This is my mom!
I'm alive!
Honey!
I heard your conversation
Arima
I also had problems related to my age
I understand her a little
It looks like I don't have much
When I went to middle school, I was fired from the agency
I'm still upset
Wow
Miyako!
What? I didn't say I was against it
What about you, Ruby?
Only for!
Age does not matter for an idol
Especially if this is her dream
Welcome to love Kamachi!
Yes, thank you
My sister again
Arima, look after Ruby and Mem
Shut up! Who allowed you to talk to me?
Go hug your Kurakawa and Akane
Damn traitor!
Don't ask, I'll take care of them anyway
Maybe we should go eat together?
Yes, come on!
Why are you so kind?
I'm so glad!
So, Memchou joined our group
New Bikamachi is now officially a group
What?
Well, love with a star is over
Listen, what did you feel when your brother kissed you?
What did I feel?
Do you think there's anything but pure hatred?
That's true
Five times worse than when a brother and a sister kissed in one TV series
Terrible!
I'm sure you'll meet Akane someday
She's your brother's girlfriend, isn't she?
Girlfriend?
But...
I'm sure Akane's feelings are just...
Are you talking about love with a star?
Oh, yes
Did you watch it?
I know some actors
It was interesting
Come on, you can be honest
There were so many beautiful people
A real eye-catcher
Eye-catcher?
Even stars don't say that
Who doesn't like beautiful people?
But my eyes were really good
It seemed as if I started to see better
She's so strange!
To be honest, I wanted to see the girl's face
If I were one of the boys, I would definitely hit her
I thought I'd win her heart
Shiranui is so calm on TV
But when she talks to us...
They say they act so often
Yeah
It's harder for funny girls to gain popularity
Because guys think they're rivals, not cuties
Yeah
That's why pretty girls usually behave calmly
Horrible!
Maybe it's because I know Akane personally
But he made my heart flutter
I'm sure everyone thinks so
It seems that Akane is very popular among girls in general education
He also has fans in performing arts
Everyone knows that he's in a relationship now
So they'll have to wait
Love with a star turned out to be popular
And certainly changed my brother's career
But the show also influenced Inobikamachi
Thanks to Mimcho, the videos on our channel
became much better than they were before
10,000 subscribers!
I've seen our videos on my channel
It would be strange not to subscribe to so many people
It's like we've become a real group
Why didn't we do that before?
We didn't publish anything except videos about acquaintances
It would be better to release a video as soon as possible
Right
What's new with the music?
The director contacted the acquaintances of the performers
But since there is no music, you can't do anything
We still have a lot ahead
Let's relax while we can
But there is no music
So what?
Did you forget that we are Inobikamachi?
We have music from the past Inobikamachi
And the truth is that we can sing old songs
Exactly
Mimcho, you're a genius!
Damn, they guessed
We will practice nonstop
If we postpone it, we won't notice how long it will take
Terrible
It's the duty of any idol
Pride is the hardest part of being an idol
Let's start dancing training!
There are still 30 songs on this disc
Each has its own dance
I won't be able to remember all of them in my life
I don't have the same motivation as a couple of crazy fans
Why did I agree to be an idol?
You're good
Thank you
Don't! I don't want to see you!
Lately, you've been very strict with me
I know that you always speak a strange language
But...
Even I will be hurt if you keep going
What?
It's all because of you!
No!
Aqua!
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
Do you really see yourself as a knight?
Yeah, you don't have to talk with me
I was going to say it
Huh?
Yeah, I ought to say
discussion is like digging a corpse
Why should you want to learn about Ai's life?
I'm her fan
She's aagreed and hopeless
Yeah, it's a world of bluffing.
When a suitable person lies in the right way,
he creates an image that doesn't exist in the real world.
In fact, our job is to convince all the time,
as if we're lying to a conversation in a big company.
It doesn't matter, I still want to know.
And if you're her fan, it's even better not to know.
But you don't seem to be convinced.
As I said, I knew her well and worked with her many times.
At that time, she was nobody.
Just a villager who came from the deaf.
Her skills were poor and she couldn't introduce acquaintances.
She wore cheap clothes that didn't suit her at all.
That's how she was.
Therefore, to help her, I introduced her to the dead actors
from one theater company.
Dead?
Once upon a time, she had her own company.
This is the La-La-Lay theater.
That's where Akane is.
Although at that time they were not so famous.
They say that love changes people.
It should be in that place.
And I found my love.
Since she was there,
she began to follow her appearance more
and ask me about private restaurants.
I don't even know who that guy was.
But I remember how quickly her face grew.
If you want, I can introduce you to the head of La-La-Lay.
Oh, there you can get closer to the answer you are looking for.
Why are you helping me?
I'm just a useless actor without any achievements.
Because you have potential.
The world of show business is the world of trade.
In Japan, the relationship between advertising agencies and actors
strongly affects the quality of the final product.
And the profit can change to hundreds of millions of yen,
depending on the composition.
Here, such money is spinning,
such a dinner for 40,000 yen is nothing.
By making you a debtor now,
I can get a huge benefit later,
when you will be at the top and become a real star.
What a job, producer.
And of course I do this not only for you.
I see no less potential in Arimekani and even in Memcho.
I think it will be interesting to follow you.
I heard you are reviving the Bikomachi group.
I must say, it's a very good investment option.
It can't be.
Japanese idol festivals?
Yes.
The producer of Love with a Star has a lot of connections.
Therefore, if we want, they will find us a place in the schedule.
IFA is already a month away?
No, it's impossible.
We are not ready at all.
How come?
Newbies like us can go on such a ...
Yes, yes, we will go!
This is IFA, IFA!
Isn't it cool if a new group of Bikomachi
immediately gets on such a stage?
Only, I don't think people will take it well.
They will complain that we went through the connections.
Yes, everything will be fine.
We are not someone there, but the heirs of the legendary Bikomachi.
In fact, you just took and stole their name.
I think it's a sin not to use this opportunity.
Of course, you can only step on such a stage after a long year of hard work.
If we don't agree, why are we even doing this?
I guess you're right.
Okay, if you insist, let it be.
This is my job.
Hooray, you're the boss!
Now there is one thing left.
It's time to solve this question.
Which one?
Who will become the leader of Bikomachi?
Is it so important?
Does it matter who?
Of course it's important!
The leader is a star among idols,
the face of the group, the best of all singing and dancing.
This is the most important member of the group.
Well?
How well you sang.
Okay, and who wants to be the leader?
It's not what I wanted, but if you insist.
You need wisdom here that comes with years.
I don't want to, but I'm the oldest here.
You both want to be the leaders.
I'm good at dancing.
How can I not be?
No, no, it should be me.
I have a lot of experience on the Internet.
But then the leader should be Kana.
Her charge with peppers took the first place in the chart.
She was even shown on TV.
Wow, I haven't heard her for a long time.
Don't dig into my damn past!
Let's start the charge with peppers!
Eat peppers and you will become a superman!
Dance with us and you will be a Peter Pan!
How cute, she slightly hit us by the nose.
Yes, so childish and funny.
Did you dance so much for her in the kindergarten?
Can you sing a little?
Not for anything in the world!
I know that I sing terribly bad.
Maybe the main thing for the leader is singing?
It's true.
How can you be a leader if someone else sings?
Well, it started.
Whoever gets the biggest points in karaoke will become the leader!
The challenge is accepted.
Is Kana with us?
No, I refuse.
What? Why?
That's stupid.
The leader is the face of the group.
If I become the leader, the group will never be successful.
Don't say that.
I know a lot of such cases.
Huh?
I've been in this business for a long time.
And I didn't leave even when I grew up.
Do you think I was just trying to play?
I didn't look for popularity, trying everything I could.
Because of which the companies that offered to work for my former fame lost a lot of money.
But I still clung to any contract with all my strength.
As a result, I, Kana, have never gained a fan base.
It's not surprising that no one wants to invest money in someone like me.
Oh, that's right.
Our sweet has failed today.
And the meme has a lot of subscribers.
You're pretty cute.
And your cuteness will sell out to the fans.
Besides, people usually like cute girls, like you two.
I'm not interested in such rude people like me.
Think about me as an addition to the group.
Decide for yourself who will be the leader.
In karaoke or whatever.
Lately, you've been too strict with yourself.
Did something bad happen?
Nothing like that.
Everything will be fine.
After all, even my brother, who will never praise anyone in life, called you cute.
You're not rude and not annoying.
But he said the same meme about love with a star.
Okay, sometimes you're still boring.
You have an answer to everything.
It will be hard for the one who will become your boyfriend.
It's okay.
All people in show business are unusual in their own way.
Stop.
They both joined after Aqua asked them.
I don't like to realize this, but it seems I'm starting to understand the tastes of my brothers.
Then come a little later.
Yeah.
And you argued with me with some kind of result.
And you're not even better than me.
For idols, the main thing is uniqueness.
Even if I'm not the best, I'm still valuable.
But if you're hopeless, nothing will shine on you.
But my fans will be able to see how their favorite idol over time becomes better and better.
So that's what I can show them.
The main thing is a dramatic story.
We should have exercised more in singing.
We will practice together.
You can't drag the others into your wonder.
Okay, let's take a break.
Yeah.
What songs are there to relax?
Maybe we'll sing the charge with the pepper of the kamekans?
You have interesting tastes, Ruby.
Nathan, what are you doing here?
I'm going to sing a song for you.
Interesting tastes, Ruby.
I like it.
Oh, and Arima turns out to have a lot of songs, except for the peppers.
I didn't know.
Shall we listen?
Come on.
Come on.
What a strange song.
It's a bad song.
It's too harsh for me.
I don't like it.
I like it.
I like it.
I like it.
I like it.
I like it.
I like it.
I like it.
I like it.
I like it.
