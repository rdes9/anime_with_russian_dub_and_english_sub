        <pre>That's right, it's simple, but it's sour
It doesn't look like it, but it tastes like honey
There's no such thing, no such thing, no such thing
The type you like, love it, come on, answer me
I don't know who I like
I really don't know lies
I fall for that kind of words again
I make you fall in love again
Everyone is being taken away
You are the ultimate idol, the perfect one
I can't show up anymore
I'm the first one to be stopped
Ah, if I love you with that smile
Everyone will be taken away
Even if those eyes, those words are a lie
It's a perfect love
이었
Well taken care of and shining hair
Face not lost child innocence
Open and a little vain
No doubt
I like idol fans. Over the many years
I can say that exactly as such she be popular
I really don't like your analysis
Why don't you invite her?
Well, I can, of course, but...
You know, we're not in a good relationship, Loli Senpai.
Really?
Don't you see that I'm not in a good relationship with her?
Maybe you should joke less about her.
Okay, I'll text her, but at least try to talk to her.
And if you can't get along with her, forget about this video.
Can you stay home for a while after school?
What does it mean?
Why did you invite me?
He wants to discuss something important alone.
So, does he really want to confess?
What should I do?
I need to talk to him.
Okay, I'll talk to him.
Okay, I'll talk to him.
Okay, I'll talk to him.
Okay, I'll talk to him.
Are you crazy?
Are you crazy?!
She has to hug me!
she has to hug me!
Why me?
I can't find an essentially gentle grandpa!
Why me?!
It can't be that way!
Sorry, it's late.
So what?
Why did you invite me?
So, why did you invite me?
I'm sorry or actually I really don't want to!
I'm sorry or actually I really don't want to!
And who's the group here?
Aqua, if I offer her now, it will mean that I think she's cute enough to be an idol.
It's annoying, I don't want to!
And where does such pride come from?
You want to be an idol as soon as possible.
Now is not the time to be stubborn.
Yes, perhaps you're right, Aqua.
Arimakana!
Will you join my idol group?
Idol? Why so suddenly?
Strawberry Productions wants to create a new group, and we need participants.
I heard that you are free, so consider it an offer.
Are you serious now?
Yes, and this is very important.
Let me think about it.
No, this is not for me.
If I agree, I will lose many roles and offers in the cinema, and I will fall into the stream of changing idols.
And if something goes wrong, I will lose everything.
I was trying to get everything for too long to take a risk.
But...
She looks like Rubia.
There is something unusual about her.
I worked with her only once, but at first glance it was clear that she was born to be successful.
And my acting instincts say that she has potential.
But still.
Strawberry Productions is a small company, they have no large projects for a long time.
Besides, I'm not good enough for the role.
I'm not good enough for the role.
I'm sorry, but...
I'm sorry, Ari McCanna.
I'm sorry, but...
Please, make your idol with my sister.
But I'm not cute enough...
No, you are very cute, would you ask to be an ordinary girl?
But you are much cuter than most idols.
And it seems to me that you are cleverer than most idols.
I don't care if you're an ordinary girl, but you're much more brave than the majority of idols.
And I think my sister will be in good hands with you.
What? But...
Please, be an idol.
Not at all!
Please.
I said no!
I only ask because I believe in you.
Enough! No matter how much you ask, I still don't agree!
Not at all in the world!
Agreement. Ari Makano.
Welcome to Strawberry Productions.
I know it's a terrible idea!
And why am I always involved in this?
Let's get to the bottom of it, Senpai.
I can't believe you persuaded her.
And how did you do it?
Nothing special. I just could understand her.
Ari Makano is very sensitive and can't stand the pressure.
After thinking a little, I decided that if I was convincing and sincere, it would work, and that's what happened.
Oh, these guys.
If you continue to do this, you'll pay for it one day.
Look around when you leave the house at night.
And you can still pay back quickly.
I don't know what I did wrong.
Are you teasing me?
What? No, of course not!
Well, from what I know, there's only one thing that doesn't matter.
A brilliant actress's child in the past.
So I need something that will push me into action.
You need it so much that you agreed?
Besides, if we're in the same agency, there will be more chances to work with him.
Maybe I'll look at a couple of acting techniques.
Do you think it will work?
By the way, does Aqua already have any new offers?
There is one offer.
What kind of sad look?
Look.
What?
Aqua found an acquaintance?
The beginning of my love with a star.
The new season of the show is coming soon.
And with him new love will bloom.
Participants of the new season.
Hi!
My name is Sumi Yuki.
I'm a first-year student.
What a beauty!
I'm dressed in the latest fashion.
I'm Kumano Nobuyuki. I don't care about dancing.
I'm Kurokawa Akane. I'm a second-year actress.
Oh, and she's here!
Do you know her?
You could say that.
My name is Memocho. I'm streaming on YouTube.
Nice to meet you!
They invite people like that?
Sweetie!
I'm Marimoto Kengo. I play in a band.
Let's get to know each other.
What grade are you in?
Second. And I'm in third.
I see.
This is one of those popular shows
where young celebrities get to know each other.
And then, if they go, they can start dating.
But who's left there?
This is another show in Kaburagi.
It's not surprising that everyone's so good.
Oh, there you are.
I'm Aqua.
I'm so excited.
I'm glad to meet you.
Who's that?
Where's my thoughtful and cute brother?
He's clearly playing.
Oh, what a handsome guy.
Actors are so cool.
Well, no.
Brother doesn't like people as cute and innocent as she is.
She has no chance.
She's a cute girl, too.
I feel a little awkward.
What?
What's wrong with him?
He called me cute only when he asked me to join you.
So, attention hit him in the head.
When he comes back, I'll give it to him.
The brother turns out to be an ordinary man.
That's what he's trying to do.
Who's going to get it?
Calm down.
It's just a TV show.
If he doesn't play, the show will fail.
I understand why you don't like it
when he behaves like that with other girls.
Aqua is an actor.
Most likely, he decided
that it's best to play like that.
Play?
I understand that.
But at this show, the participants get closer
and even start to meet.
Right.
Even if not for real,
most likely, it will be so.
If they start to meet,
then they kiss?
Why did he agree to take part in this?
If you continue to play,
then sooner or later,
they will ask you to kiss the camera.
It's important to be able to share love and work.
If you cling to such things,
in the end, you will definitely hurt yourself.
I understand everything.
Look, here's my dog.
Tell me, is he really cute?
Here, look at him.
Is he cute?
Yes, he's cute.
I'm sick of it.
I hate conversations
in which I have to give up.
And when did it end?
If you agree,
I'll tell you about Aya
and even what her agency didn't know.
For example,
information about her relationship with the guys.
But I have to continue.
Everything to find out
the truth about Aya from Kaburagi
will give us a clue
that will allow us to find our father.
The reality show is simple.
You can just
communicate with each other.
Just remember
that you are being filmed.
And if the cameraman comes to you,
it will be very convenient
if you briefly
retell your conversation.
Such a reality show
has existed for more than 20 years.
So there are a lot of tricks.
The fact that the show is live
guarantees views.
At the same time, everyone has
opportunities to play.
I'm sorry, did I play well?
I think
it's good.
Although it would be better
if next time
you came a little closer.
The audience wants their hearts to beat.
I see.
So there are no scenarios at all?
There are no scenarios.
I don't know what to talk about at all.
Me neither.
There are no scenarios here.
However,
there is directing.
And everyone decides
to take it as a direction or advice.
I'm fragile,
I'm not special.
And the communication is not so good.
I'm sure I'll stay in the background.
Why did you agree to this job?
The star of my agency
does not refuse offers.
She takes all the work
for herself, and my schedule is empty
all year long.
I tried to do at least something,
and then I met Kaburagi.
I see.
It just so happened.
Plus, I've never met anyone else.
It can't be.
No, it's true.
I'm just a freshman.
Not everyone has a show business.
There have already been relationships with someone.
Are you interested in romance?
Of course, yes.
Like any guy.
But I still
can't forget about my past love.
Although
I'm not sure it's the love
you're talking about.
But I didn't get over it.
Come on.
Everything is so complicated.
Is it really something like
teacher's love?
You could say that.
I'm sure you can handle it.
By the way, did you know
a couple from last season
kissed at the end?
Yes, I watched the show before the shooting.
I was afraid
there would be no good guys here.
But maybe
I would kiss you.
But...
Behind us.
The cameraman is filming us.
Don't look straight into the camera.
I'm sure it will be in the series.
Let's be friends.
She's very nice.
And you can't call her a bitch.
I see.
So this is a reality show.
I'm still your sister.
So I won't let you meet
someone I don't like.
Got it?
So I'll choose who you'll meet.
Maybe that's enough.
So I recommend
Sumiyuki.
I think she's the best.
You don't understand
at all.
What?
Frill isn't here again today.
I heard she started shooting.
She must be busy.
I see.
And you, Minami?
I have a photoshoot today.
I see.
My brother is shooting again today.
You see,
you're used to sitting without work.
As you usually spend time.
If you continue, I will not
endure and get angry.
If there is nothing to do, then learn.
Idol career is not that long.
So it's better to be able to earn a living.
It will be nice if you go to college.
Then you won't be without work.
That's right.
Can we really do
nothing at all?
New idols usually give concerts,
and from time to time they get
an invitation to a TV show.
Don't we have a song?
Even the name of the band
is not there yet.
What can we do in your opinion?
We don't have a name
because you're behaving like that.
When we come up with a name,
everything will start to seem real.
I still can't speak the language
of being called an idol.
So what? I'm an idol.
It's embarrassing.
How can I tell my parents
that I call myself that?
I haven't done anything yet.
So you need experience, right?
If so, let's get started.
What kind of camera is this?
It's inexpensive, but it works great.
Before,
it was much more difficult
to be an idol.
Now it's much easier to sing
and sing at the same concert.
But now it's all different.
Modern idol culture
is right on the Internet.
It's the best place to find a fan base.
That's why you should
earn your name in it.
Through YouTube?
Yes. First you get an audience,
and then you invite them to the concert.
Miyako, you're a genius!
The director is not too
left-wing and optimistic.
She's lucky if she gets
a couple thousand subscribers.
What did you say?
Even my fans won't get
ten thousand.
And if we give them a concert,
they'll get a maximum of one percent.
It doesn't sound very reliable.
You're right,
but there are people
who know the Internet
very well in Strawberry Productions.
We have a lot of experience.
By the way,
I hope you'll learn a lot.
Okay, I'm counting on you.
Trust me!
Ghost!
Hi, Pion!
What? Who?
He's very popular among children.
Have you ever heard
about the famous YouTuber in a mask?
He's the most successful member of the agency.
Yes, I've never heard anything like it!
I haven't been watching
YouTube at all.
That's what children like these days.
What rotten world
are we living in?
Don't talk about Pion!
Pion! Hurry up!
Understand her!
What can I do?
The Internet is all about raising the noise.
Even if the content itself is just
taken from boring TV shows.
I earn a hundred million a year.
I'm terribly sorry for my words.
So!
What do you think about
getting subscribers quickly?
Video every day can already be famous.
Yes, you're absolutely right.
But you're not well known enough.
You can't shoot a video every day.
Just like a patient.
However, there is another
secret way that will suit you.
I had no doubt in our mentor.
Please tell me.
Then listen carefully.
Pi-pi-pi!
You are on the Pion channel!
And today I have to do
one very important thing.
My agency is
creating a new idol group.
Therefore, I was asked to tell
about it. At the very beginning,
I really wanted to refuse.
But the director still asked me.
And today we will show you ...
The dance of the Pion!
If they hold on,
they can often show their faces!
Pi-chi-ku!
Pa-chi-ku!
Do it!
From today on, you will also
wear a mask! Pi-ya-pi-ya-pi!
In this world,
you have to eat meat and vegetables!
Do it!
Power is power!
The strict boundaries are different!
Sit down, stretch your legs,
bend your heels!
It's hard!
It's terribly difficult to sing
because you have to wear a mask!
He wants to kill us!
Po-za-ais-ta!
I can't breathe!
Po-za-p-ti-n-ta!
Why do I need all this?
The easiest way to become famous is collaboration!
And if this collaboration with a popular YouTuber,
then it's even better!
I will let you appear on my channel,
but what would we shoot?
Since you are idols,
can you play while you sleep?
Yes, not a bad idea!
But if we are told about it,
then it will not be a challenge anymore!
Are you serious now?
Imagine, there will be a shooting group of idols,
and there is her boyfriend!
This is always planned in advance!
Seriously?
But this is our very first job!
I don't want to lie!
And it's all because of her!
Why is everything like this?
I can handle it,
I trained a lot,
but for a newcomer like her ...
It's hard!
I'm about to fall!
Po-za-na-setki! Po-za-na-setki!
Great! We're done!
You can take off your masks and introduce yourself!
I'm Hoshina Ruby
from Strobury Productions!
I'm a beginner idol!
Now it's your turn!
I'm Harima Kana!
I'm also an idol! Hello everyone!
Come on, I've heard about you somewhere!
Just heard?
Yes, just great!
I thought to edit it as if
you were dancing for an hour,
but you don't even have to do that!
The audience would not notice this,
but the shooting group sees everything!
I like you!
Oh!
I almost forgot to ask!
Does your group have a name?
Ah...
You can choose
whatever you want, Ruby!
Really?
Then let the name be
Mikamachi!
What?
Can we take it?
I'm Harima Kana!
I'm also an idol!
I'm Harima Kana!
I'm also an idol!
I'm also an idol!
I'm also an idol!
I'm also an idol!
