        <pre>So, simple, but sour,
It's hard to see,
The secret is the taste of honey.
There's no such thing, no such thing,
There's no such thing, no such thing,
The type you like is the other person.
Now, answer me!
I don't know who I like,
I don't know if it's a lie or not.
I fall into that kind of words again,
I make you fall in love again.
Everyone is being taken away by you,
You are a perfect and ultimate idol.
I can't show up in this world,
I'm the first to be stopped.
Ah, if you love me with that smile,
Everyone will be taken away by you.
Even if those eyes and those words are a lie,
It's a perfect love.
Episode 2
No! Let go!
Calm down!
I'm not an enemy.
Please be quiet.
Agus!
But why?
The meme said that you left home during the typhoon and didn't come back.
She was looking for you everywhere, but couldn't find you.
That's why I went to the nearest store.
You're so stupid.
Hey, you two!
It's dangerous here!
What are you doing here in this weather?
The criticism of Kurokawa and Akane doesn't stop.
Although it's not surprising considering what she did.
Is it really something that you can get used to over time?
Just a little bit.
In fact, everyone has it differently.
Some never get used to it at all.
In bad days.
And sometimes I come up with the idea
to just die and get rid of all the problems.
And the fact that the girl will feel for the first time
under such a guise of bullying is even hard to imagine.
But that's enough to want to calm down.
Such reality shows of acquaintances are popular all over the world.
About 50 people died because of them.
In some countries, actors were forced to meet psychologists.
If 50 people died,
you can safely say that the same fate
barely reached 10 times more people.
In reality shows, you have to put your soul on the show.
And all the criticism falls on the actors, not on the show.
It's so hard to cope with.
Exactly, Aqua said that lying is the best way to protect yourself.
Very wise.
Hiding behind your character is much easier.
The more you show your true self, the more painful it is.
And in social networks, all the negativity is put on the show.
Thanks to freedom and impunity,
every day someone receives a whole bunch of terrible messages.
Everyone thinks that they are an exception
and have the right to poison others.
But their mindless words can lead to someone else's death.
I wonder if Aqua is okay.
You don't have to worry about him.
It's not for nothing that they say that everyone is unique in their own way.
Everyone has their own shortcomings,
so there will always be a reason for hatred.
Yes, that's right.
What? Really?
I see. I'll be there soon.
Did something happen to the director?
Well, Aqua...
I think he's in the police station.
What?
My daughter asked me not to watch the show,
and I almost don't use the Internet.
I couldn't even think about it.
Why?
Why didn't you tell me anything?
I just didn't want you to worry about it.
When I got a call, I was getting ready for the worst.
But you did everything right, and I'm proud of you.
You don't show it, but you worry about the others.
No, it's not about that.
People die fast.
If you don't have time to answer the call for help, it will be too late.
I'll ask Akane to pay you a taxi.
You're so greedy.
Akane!
Do you even know how we were worried?
Why did you do that? You should have talked to me.
I'm sorry.
Akane.
Tell me, what are you going to do?
What am I going to do?
I'm going to tell you that you can leave the show now.
But what about the contract?
The film crew is responsible for the young actors.
Considering the circumstances, I don't think they will interfere.
You work under your real name.
So think about it carefully and decide.
I tried so hard to become a famous actress,
to continue to perform in front of an even larger number of people.
I was supported by so many people.
But because of me, everything turned out like this.
Akane, I'm scared.
I'm very scared, but...
I'll stay.
I don't want to just give up.
I understand.
You heard. Everyone agrees.
Of course. What's the matter?
We've been talking since the beginning.
Exactly. We will support each other.
Are you getting along well?
Yes. It's not surprising. We are the same age.
It doesn't matter what others say.
If we work together, we will bring the show to the final.
But I don't want to leave everything as it is now.
The directors gave a spark, and the Internet burned it to the ground.
It annoys me.
The press service.
The police have a special department of the press service.
The place where the reporters sit 24 hours a day and are ready for any news.
They are always looking for a new sensation.
So you really decided to do this.
I praised you early.
Madis, do you know what you're doing?
Yes, but I don't know what will come of it.
Let's start a real reality show.
News of Akane's suicide attempt caused a storm of various reactions.
A stream of discontent subsided and new opinions began to appear.
You attracted attention, but nothing has changed yet.
I don't think this is a good way to end the criticism.
Especially considering that Kurakawa Akane took a break from the show and nothing is said about her return.
You're always like this.
Who will be responsible for all this?
I don't risk it when there are chances against me.
Here, like in poker, the more you bet, the more you get.
If we save, Akane will lose everything without any battle.
I will not raise the bet, I will not win.
As long as I have at least one hand, I will play.
Life is not a game of poker.
What? You need our photos and videos for the show.
I don't have a lot of them.
Only a hundred can be translated.
That's more than enough.
But why do they need you?
Love with a star is directed by a professional, right?
So they deliberately distorted Akane's image to make the show more interesting.
If you choose the right moments and make them right together, even the saint can be set as a villain.
This is the art of the show.
I know how to work with video, so I need the material.
I understand.
You want to make love with a star with our eyes, right?
Did someone tell you that?
Or did you come up with it yourself?
No, I did it myself.
Wow, not a bad idea.
If you talk about it in the terms of marketeers,
there is a high probability of a positive response due to the large number of interested viewers.
At first glance, most people hate Akane, but this is only the top.
In fact, very few people write such a thing.
The attempt to commit suicide is a delicate topic,
so the silent majority do not know whether to continue to poison Akane or defend her.
In other words, many of them need a push.
Therefore, if we create a good impression,
the majority will believe that it is the right thing.
And by taking so much attention, we can completely change the opinion of the viewers.
In addition, we have an official reality show account,
so it will not be difficult to spread it.
And if the video turns out to be good, we will make a lot of noise.
Send it to me as soon as you finish, I'll upload it.
I can do it myself.
So, do you know what day, week and time to upload it so that there are more retweets?
And what should be the length of the tweet to spread the interest?
No.
But I've been doing this for a long time and I know everything about marketing.
Believe it or not, but I don't care.
What? Then I'll write music.
Can you handle it?
Actually, I have a contract with the studio.
I make money with music.
In addition, I write music and lyrics for the songs of my group,
and sometimes for others.
I think I need something sad.
This is my part.
What do you think? Maybe it's worth adding this scene?
What scene?
Well, remember the one I hugged Kane after she hit me?
Yes, but all the cameras turned off.
Ha-ha, how naive.
Do you think a professional model like me doesn't know where the cameras are?
I chose the best place to make everything look perfect.
You've just ruined this moment.
I'm sure they have a recording.
They don't show it on purpose.
How ashamed they are!
You're right, we have a recording.
But you can't show it to the audience.
I won't give it to you.
Well, I see.
If this goes to the surface,
everyone will understand that you deliberately made Kane a villain.
And given how this topic is known,
all criticism will immediately shift Kane to a reality show.
I'm glad you understand that.
Reality shows are made for entertainment.
Now everyone who watches the show is interested in seeing the conflicts.
No one forced Kane to do this.
It was her choice,
and our processing only simplified the perception for the audience.
If she was against it,
she would have just forbidden us to use the recording.
Kane has a strong sense of responsibility.
I know, we've been filming her so much.
Don't forget, she's a professional.
We just do our job.
So she's a professional.
How old are you, director?
35, so what?
And Kane is only 18.
Whether she's a professional or not,
she's still a child and has the right to make mistakes.
What kind of adults are you if you don't protect children?
You're right.
No, not like that.
Make it longer,
so that it looks like a beginner.
I'll put a song in here.
Yes, and turn on the sound.
Shut up a little.
Look, what cool photos they gave us.
Wow!
Let's add more.
Natasha doesn't fit.
Great!
It looks great!
Hey, director!
The video has been coded!
We can upload it!
Damn, and why do you need such a powerful computer?
You didn't let me sleep.
I wonder how many views it will get.
I'd like to get at least 5,000 retweets.
It's not that easy.
Yes, sometimes, even if you don't like it,
it's not that easy.
I don't like it.
I don't like it.
I don't like it.
I don't like it.
Don't say that.
My job is very simple.
Sometimes, even if you try a lot,
the video won't be successful.
I think, if we get a hundred retweets
in the first minute,
in the end many people will see it.
prowad us.
We did everything we could,
and the show will begin.
You did nothing at all.
You have a bad habit.
I'm your girl, huh?
I did it!
This is what I need!
Hooray!
I understand you.
You were too nervous.
I'm sorry.
You have a photo shoot tomorrow, right?
Are you okay?
Akana, do you hate me?
No, what are you? You're so strong and kind. I admire you.
Me too. You're so hardworking and never give up.
That's why I'm not angry.
In 24 hours, the video got 74,000 retweets.
And together with the change of Akane's image,
it strengthened the popularity of love with the star.
Thanks to the video, the noise is a little quieter.
But unfortunately, the critics of the network never completely subsides.
Akane!
Some people don't forget that even in 10 years,
they will still remember this in any suitable case.
Nevertheless, I'll be back for the shoot.
I'm so glad.
Just don't force yourself, okay?
Oh, don't get me wrong.
I really want you to come back.
But be careful.
I know.
It's so hard to keep track of what I'm saying.
Write this on Twitter, I would be canceled.
You should be careful.
Akane, maybe you'll come up with a personality?
It will be much easier to play.
After all, if you are yourself, you will be much sicker.
Personality?
Right.
If you start playing the role, it will become your shield.
Showing your true personality is dangerous.
And it works not only on the reality show.
It helps even in everyday life.
I wonder how much you hid in the role.
You would have opened up more.
I'll be patient.
Right.
I'm not bad at playing.
I'll try.
Right.
You're a professional actress.
Yes, that's all I can do.
But what role should I play?
Hmm.
Akko, which girls do you like?
What do I have to do with it?
There are no other guys around now.
Well, tell me about your perfect girlfriend.
Perfect?
She has a beautiful face.
Ugh, it's terrible.
So you're one of those who only cares about appearance?
A bright smile, perfect on stage,
catching the attention,
eyes that attract everything to them.
Yeah, it's a difficult requirement.
It's very vague.
Hmm.
I think I know.
Someone like Aya from the Bicomach.
Aya?
Are you talking about that Aydel?
Yes, about her.
Did I make a mistake?
No, the description is quite accurate.
So that's who you like.
You're a beauty lover.
I'll try to play a girl who likes Akko.
Yeah, come on!
Let her go crazy about you!
No one can imitate Aya.
She has natural talent.
I'll try.
Akko tried so hard to make this video especially for me.
And he went after me, even in such a storm.
I was so happy.
I have to repay him.
I wonder if I play his perfect girlfriend,
will he be happy?
Aya from the Bicomach.
I have to find out everything.
Her eyes are so beautiful.
Maybe it's because of her confidence.
She also needed recognition from the public.
She didn't have many friends.
But I'm sure she had a relationship with someone.
Did she grow up in a good family?
No.
Judging by her character, it's the other way around.
She is very unusual in expressing her attachment.
I don't know.
She is very unusual in expressing her attachment.
Although she is known very secretly.
Perfectionist with a strange behavior.
Safe and extremely attached.
Carefully with money.
A little careless with fashion.
Good vision.
Great hearing and smell.
Confident steps.
Not very good at school.
Strangely holds sticks.
Signs of development.
Unbalanced.
Typical for early pregnancy.
Self-destructive behavior.
Improved at the age of 15.
Self-destructive behavior.
Improved at the age of 15.
Self-destructive behavior.
Improved at the age of 15.
Maybe she met someone.
It's not easy for Kurakova.
Everything will be fine with her.
Yes, she is recovering.
I see.
And why didn't she leave the show business?
And why didn't she leave the show business?
What? I'm sorry.
No, no, I didn't mean that.
In the sense that she is my competitor.
Oh, scary tongue.
Say that to the audience,
I would have an end.
It doesn't matter what you mean.
It's not good to say that.
Well, we are the same age.
And we are both actresses.
It's not easy to fight with her.
Now you understand why I want this.
Now you understand why I want this.
It's not because of simple malice.
It's because of greed.
Do you think Kurakova Akane is better than you?
Of course.
Oh, right.
You are not interested in theater.
You are in films.
Kurakova Akane from the Lalalai theater
is famous for her play
among theater fans.
Akane is coming back to us today.
Please.
I'm sorry for all the inconveniences
that have been delivered.
I will try to cope with it
with all my strength.
I'm glad to work with you.
Well, then let's get started.
Let's go.
Uh-huh.
What do you say, Akane?
I want to sleep.
Why is it always so early to shoot?
Oh, is it already shooting us?
And without this my
noise
is

Oh, children of the stars, go to sleep
