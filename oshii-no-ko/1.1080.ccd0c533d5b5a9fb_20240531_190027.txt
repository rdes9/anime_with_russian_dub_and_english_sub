This story is just an illusion, even no, almost the whole world is an invention.
Idols lie, exaggerate and carefully hide the uncomfortable truth.
It can be said that idol fans themselves want to be deceived.
In the world of show business, a lie is a weapon.
I want to see her cuteness live!
The unrivaled leader of the idol group Bicomache is unwavering, a beautiful 16-year-old girl.
Their group is already 4 years old, they gradually gained popularity and looked for fans.
And now, finally, the public recognized them.
I am convinced that her fame will only grow now.
Why are you watching the concert of idols in the patient's room?
It's strange by all means.
Look at beautiful things, it's good for your health.
In such a faraway country, concerts are not held.
This is a regular therapy.
You clearly tried to drag the patient into the cult.
Don't give it up for the recommendation of our hospital.
Oh, by the way, I remembered.
There was news on Twitter.
What?
Oh, he's taking a break because of the disease?
Wait!
What kind of crazy fan are you?
She's only 16, pervert.
Please don't call me that.
I have my own reasons.
Once upon a time, I was in the office here.
Then, like now, I was resting in the patient's room from time to time.
Lazy.
And the meeting with one of the patients forever changed my life.
Look, this is Mei-Mei.
She dances so cool.
Aria and Kion, of course, dance well.
But if you choose the best, then her.
Undoubtedly.
She is my partner.
But she dances and sings no worse than adults.
And what a beauty she is!
I wish I could be reborn as such a cutie.
What kind of rebirth?
Don't talk nonsense.
You're so annoying, Doc.
You never thought about how it would be to give birth to a child of fame.
If you had the right acquaintance and appearance from birth.
No.
So you really didn't dream about it?
You're so cute, Sarina.
You don't need to be reborn.
When you graduate, you can become an idol yourself.
I'll be your fan.
Really?
I love you, Doc.
Marry me!
If I do this, I'll be dead as a person.
Oh, what a moralist.
Sorry.
But when you grow up to 16, I'll think.
To 16?
You're harmful, Doc.
For me, it's quite a feasible plan.
Anoplastic Ostrotoma.
She was only 12.
If she were alive, she would be 16 now, like me.
Perhaps I still see Sarina's dreams in her favorite idol.
I just want to watch her.
Then she goes to her dream.
I see.
You're a disgusting pervert.
Did you hear that?
It's quite a touching story.
And still, your content is suspicious.
Are you sure you don't use Sarina as an excuse for your desires?
Nonsense.
I swear on behalf of Sarina that my feelings are absolutely pure.
What if Ai offered to meet you?
Would you agree?
Well, the break is over.
It's time to go back to work.
What happened, Doc?
And what about the oath on behalf of Sarina?
And still, I'm worried about Ai.
I hope she'll be back soon.
I apologize for the delay.
So, Hoshin, is this your first inspection?
Yes.
It looks like she's already in her 20th week.
It's too late for the first inspection.
She's only 16.
Looks like it wasn't easy for her.
Apparently, she's one of those who won't say anything about it right away.
Are you her father?
Well, on paper, yes.
She grew up in a children's home.
In fact, I take care of her.
Although, rather, I'm a teacher.
I see.
16 years old, grew up in a children's home.
I've heard it somewhere.
As if...
Doc, what should we do?
Is there a chance of a really serious case of a lock?
If so, she would already be dead.
Don't worry, it's all right.
I'll have to look after myself.
Wait here while I prepare everything.
Stop, stop, stop, stop!
Yeah, well, is that her?
Maybe a double?
No.
Such a loyal fan as I could not be mistaken.
Wow!
She's so cute after all!
Stop!
No!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
No!
My beloved idol is pregnant!
What kind of noise is this?
I'm suffocating right now.
And when did this happen?
That's exactly how!
Why didn't you at least consult me?
Tell me at least who is the father.
Well...
It's a secret!
Secret?
I give up!
You're just unbearable!
The examination showed that you are on the 20th week and you have a double.
A double?
A double.
Oh, are you really ready for this?
If someone finds out that you got pregnant at 16,
your and my career will come to an end.
Doctor, what do you think?
In the end, the decision is yours.
But think about it.
That's all I can say as a doctor.
As a doctor.
Next news.
Are you serious?
I liked her so much.
Who could have thought?
Stop!
If I die now, I can give birth to a child.
Right?
You have a good idea.
Seriously, how can you support an idol if she has children?
Even if you love someone, I will still support you.
But will you be able to stay at the top if you have children?
What a selfish fan you are!
Do you agree, Sarina?
Oh, doctor?
Hushina!
It's cold here, you can get cold.
Everything is fine, I'm warmly dressed.
This place was chosen by the director, but it's so cool here.
You can admire the stars even at sunset.
You will never see something like this in Tokyo.
Did you come here from Tokyo so that no one would recognize you?
What?
Did I talk about work?
Once upon a time I had a patient.
She was your fan.
Damn!
I thought that the doctors would be the only grandfathers, and no one would recognize me.
It looks like my shining aurora has been revealed to me.
So confident and terribly cute.
So you will stop being an idol?
Why?
For nothing.
But how?
The thing is that I don't have a family, and I've always dreamed about them.
If I have twins, I'm sure we will become a fun and noisy family.
So you will be born and be an idol?
So that means...
Yes, no one will recognize us.
Idols are perfect.
We shine brightly in magic and lies.
Because a lie is a special form of love.
Hiding one or two children is not a problem for a good idol.
We tell a lie for a lie.
And no matter what misfortunes we have, we are the happiest people on the stage.
But still, I would like to be really happy.
Although no one thinks about it, but we also have feelings.
Happiness is to be a mother, and happiness is to be an idol.
Usually you have to choose.
But I want both.
Hoshino Ai is very greedy.
When I met Ai, I realized that she was much stronger and braver than I could imagine.
She shined brighter than any star in the sky.
I decided...
What?
My feelings as a doctor and as a fan finally came together.
Hoshino Ai, I will do everything in my power to make you have healthy children.
If you want this, I will support you.
After all, you are an unreliable idol.
And I am your same unreliable fan.
Okay, let's get down to business.
In the hospital, it is better to use a pseudonym.
Okay.
There is a possibility that you will need to do an incision.
If the skull of the baby is too big, it is normal for someone with your figure that he may not get through.
Yes.
It is strange, the stomach will cause discomfort at work.
Doctor, there are other options.
Okay, painless births, gynecology, well...
Everything will be fine.
I am very healthy.
Ai...
Come on, I can handle natural births.
They are my children.
I'm sure they will be cute with small faces.
Well, again you are for your own...
Maybe for this very day I became a doctor.
I will do everything to make you have healthy children.
I swear to protect your family.
To be honest, I have mixed feelings.
But I will never reveal this.
Lies are love.
I looked at this phrase in a different light.
The stars are amazing.
The 40th week is the expected date of birth.
Thank you, doctor.
Will you come if I call?
Of course, I live nearby.
But if I don't have time, another doctor will help you.
No, I want you.
I'm kidding.
Okay, see you.
When everything is over, I will lose contact with Ai.
We will become ordinary fans and idols.
I saw the side that she hides.
But I liked how open and straight she was.
I can finally wish her happiness from the bottom of my heart.
Hey, is that you, Dr. Hoshino Ai?
She uses a pseudonym in the hospital.
Even if you saw her in the hospital,
how do you know her real name?
Are you connected to her?
May I know your name?
Hey!
Is he really a stalker?
Not now, but soon.
Damn it!
He made me run to the mountains.
Where did he go?
Where did he go?
He scared me.
Why did I turn off?
Oh, the phone is ringing.
Ai, the births have begun.
Where is my phone?
It's dark, I can't find it.
The body doesn't listen at all.
I need to come back as soon as possible.
I promised her that I would help to give birth to healthy children.
I have to go to her as soon as possible.
Ai!
Have you ever thought about
how it is to give birth to a child of celebrity?
If you had the right acquaintance and appearance from birth.
If I die now,
will I be able to give birth to their child?
I wish I could give birth.
I never thought about it before.
And what would I do?
Who could imagine that it would touch me somehow?
I thought that a person like me would definitely fall into hell.
However...
When I woke up, I was in heaven.
I was in heaven.
I was in heaven.
I was in heaven.
I was in heaven.
I was in heaven.
When I woke up, I was in heaven.
Look at me now.
You are so cute, Aquamarine!
I got a very unusual name.
Now I became the son of Hoshina Ai, a famous idol.
I don't know how it happened.
And I was able to accept my new reality at a very early age.
Is this my reincarnation?
Although now, it seems, they say, it's a rebirth.
Why did the memories of the past life remain?
And how can this be explained?
Although it doesn't look like it now, but I'm a doctor after all.
And I'll definitely figure out what's going on.
But for now...
I want to enjoy the life of a child to the fullest.
My new life, which my favorite idol does anything for me,
deeply touches the heart of an adult who is tired of working inside me.
I'm coming!
Exactly!
Someone else lives with us.
What happened, Ruby?
Hoshina Ruby.
She is my twin sister.
Her name is not as strange as mine.
And why did I get this?
What's wrong, Aqua?
Actually, this is Ruby.
And you call yourself a mother?
Well, what can I do?
I've always had a bad time with names.
It's terrible, isn't it?
Japanese men endlessly impose stereotypes on mothers.
You behave like a foreigner.
You don't even have a passport.
Besides, you said yourself that you wouldn't go abroad.
But I remember the names of people who are considered talented by Director Sato.
Close.
But my name is Saito, you miserable idol.
Director Ichigo Saito.
Okay, let's get down to business.
From today Aya returns to show business.
We need to discuss your activity.
The first step of the performance at the concert is tonight.
It is broadcast. Are you ready?
Of course.
And while you work, my wife will watch over the children.
Miyako Saito.
What kind of young wife do you have?
Many people are very concerned about your tendency to younger girls.
Well, I didn't know. I'll be more careful.
And I can't take the children to work?
Well, of course not.
And remember, if someone finds out that you became a mother at 16,
you can say goodbye to your career.
And together with this will come the end of my company.
And if this happens, we will all go straight to hell.
And no shopping malls or children's documents.
If it comes, then in the extreme case,
pretend that you are looking after our children.
Yes, it's a pity, Ruby.
This is Aqua.
And perhaps you can be considered a completely hopeless mother.
But the director and his wife help her in everything.
So maybe everything is not so bad.
The rehearsal will begin soon. We have to go.
Okay.
It was close. I almost showed my chest to the director.
Please be careful in public.
She is hopeless. She is completely senseless.
Meet Bikamachi.
We are Bikamachi. Thank you for the invitation.
We are glad to see you.
I can't get along with children at all.
And why do I need all this?
Can we hope for your interest?
We greet the guy who has just returned.
Are you getting along?
Yes. I ate a lot
Excellent. She jam well.
Yeah. Me too.
No, after all, she is hopeless.
The camera will switch soon. You have 30 seconds.
We hope for a great performance.
Yes, thank you!
Have you heard of Bicomachi before?
No, I'm not even interested.
I heard their songs, but they are neither good nor bad.
By the way, now it sells well.
That's for sure.
All idols are like a copy.
Again, I have to think how to praise them.
I'm only interested in what's in the middle.
I haven't heard about them for the last six months.
I wonder who pushed them.
Again, no name.
I've never heard about Strowberry Productions.
That's nothing. You should offer her to become a model.
Let's call her for dinner.
The producer will like it.
In the world of show business, lies are hidden behind every smile.
Mistakes are unacceptable during the broadcast.
In order for the performance to turn out to be perfect, even the staff will lie.
The same applies to the bosses.
They say they work for a great cause, but they only care about numbers.
Come on, show the class!
My AI is just an unsurpassed liar!
The director is very brave.
If the secret is revealed, he risks losing everything.
But I understand.
It's impossible to stay calm next to her.
In such a blazing bright light, they only have to burn.
Like butterflies stretching to the languages of flame.
They won't stop even if their wings burn.
And I'm no exception.
I'm happy to see AI so close.
I'm so glad that I'm almost grateful to the one who killed me.
Perhaps my rebirth was a miracle that happened because of my obsession with her.
That would explain a lot.
Although I would certainly like her to have regular healthy children.
But this is a phenomenon, and I can't do anything about it.
That's why I'm going to enjoy life to the fullest.
Stop!
The station has already started!
Why didn't you wake me up?
Mom is just incredibly cute!
Everyone who watches this should pay her millions!
That smile when she turns around is just something!
She's a real demon!
Damn it!
I just got a new necklace, but I think I need a new one!
She's so cute!
She's a great figure and sings the best!
Our mom is so talented!
What else can I look for?
I need to rewind and re-watch!
I'm not interested in watching the broadcast.
Why didn't you wake me up?
My body is tired all the time.
I need to help each other.
I woke you up several times.
What? Really?
This fool in front of you was reborn with me.
And I found out who she is pretty quickly.
What?
Die!
Such a fool as you!
I can't understand my mom!
At least you saw the quality of her performance!
It's not surprising that she's a fan of the company!
I'm sure you're an old crow in real life!
You'd better look in the mirror and try to say it again!
Oh my God, I can't believe it!
She was in the search for Bicamachi Ai
and entered a fierce war with her haters.
Listen...
Are you the same as me?
What?
The baby talked!
Horrible!
Look at yourself!
I feel guilty.
I wanted ordinary children to be born in Ai.
Oh my God, how cool!
You can make a recording and then re-watch it over and over again!
And we got tired of her.
You lied to me!
How dare you give birth to children!
Why?
Why?
You lied to me!
Aqua!
Are you hungry?
Do you want me to feed you?
Oh, you don't want to?
You seem to like the bottle more.
How did you get into it?
I can't make Aidel feed me with his breast.
For an adult, this is a cross-section of the line.
I'm coming.
Do you want me to feed you more?
Robby likes it.
Oh, you little...
We have to go.
Okay.
I'll be back soon.
We'll be waiting for you.
Bye.
Can you hold on a little longer?
Why?
It's perfectly normal for a mother to feed her daughter with her breast.
And for me, this is an indisputable right.
Then tell me, at least in your past life, were you a girl?
Yeah.
Well, then it's okay.
Jealousy is disgusting.
Imagine how disgusting it would be
if an adult guy fed with his breast.
It's so good that I was born with a girl
and I can eat her breast.
From a moral point of view, this is also disgusting.
Oh, poor mom.
And why is only her son a disgusting, obsessed fan?
Oh, what a poor thing.
But I'll protect you.
You're definitely worse than me.
I need to change my necklace.
So go away.
Okay, okay.
And why should I do all this?
And in general, I'm the director's wife.
I went after him because I wanted to work with a bunch of beauties.
But I have to take care of 16-year-old children.
And she doesn't even tell me who their father is.
It's suspicious.
I didn't marry to take care of the children.
What?
She should be happy about the opportunity to help her mom.
Is something wrong with her head?
No.
In general, she says quite fair things.
If you think about it, isn't this the perfect material for a scandal?
Exactly.
If I sell this story to the magazine, I'll be swimming in money.
What the hell is all this?
I'll do it.
Bad news. What should we do? Kill her?
It won't work. She's much stronger than us.
I was just kidding.
Are you seriously thinking about it?
If we leave everything as it is, it will be a disaster.
But still...
What should we do?
She's photographing Mom's medical card.
In fact, we are very lucky.
I have an idea.
I can get so much that I have enough money to buy a phone, handsome.
Oh, poor girl.
The thirst in your heart is not to remove champagne.
Who is it?
I'm the ambassador of the Lord.
I can no longer close my eyes to your evil deeds.
The ambassador of the Lord?
Wait, the child spoke.
It can't be.
Do you think it's normal for a baby to talk?
Believe me.
No, no, you're just talking about God and all sorts of things.
I don't believe it.
I got it.
It's a sound with an open camera.
They probably decided to play the manager, right?
That's right.
It came out so convincingly.
And where is the hidden camera?
It seems to be not easy.
That's it, Ruby, get down.
Otherwise, you will fall from the table.
Shut up.
I'm the embodiment of Amaterasu.
I'm so happy.
I'm so happy.
God.
You were blinded by the thirst for life.
You are crossing the border now.
Border?
Hoshina Ai was chosen as the god of entertainment.
And so her children carry a divine purpose.
Your purpose was to take care of them.
But your deeds are against the will of the gods.
But your actions are against the will of the gods.
You will know the divine punishment.
Punishment? What does it mean? What are we talking about?
What are we talking about? Well, it's...
You will die.
Exactly! You will die!
No! It's too cruel! What should I do now?
It's very simple.
Keep the secrets of the children and their mothers.
And also love these children.
And do everything they ask you to do.
Everything?
Listen, and the second marriage with the handsome will be possible.
Really? I agree! I'll do everything I need to!
At least I will lick it!
It's too much.
Marry the handsome!
Do you think we did it?
Well, we can't do much without her help.
Now we can go out.
Yes!
By the way, you played your role very convincingly.
Did you study this somewhere?
No, this is the first time.
The first time? You didn't have any classes at school?
The thing is that I didn't grow up in a normal place.
Really? Then you have talent.
Maybe you'll become an actress.
An actress?
I never thought about the future.
Now I have a younger sister.
She is strange and adores idols.
Really?
Look! Ai dances so well and she has incredible charisma!
I like Ai the most in the world.
But I like you no less, Doc.
She talks about Ai with such passion.
Just like you said, Sarina.
What did you call me?
Sorry, did I wake you up?
No, I didn't call you.
You'd better go to bed and sleep.
Oh, okay.
It can't be.
After all, Sarina and I were called in the past life.
It's been a few months since Ai came back to the stage.
And the rapid rise in the popularity of Bikamachi has not yet begun.
Balance.
There are only 200,000 in this month.
The company is not very generous.
Our Simga recently took third place in the charts.
Isn't it too small a share?
Only now you complain.
We are a small company and we can't afford to do everything from production to advertising.
You knew it when you came here.
I understand. The whole world is full of money.
A very sad discovery.
Being an idol is certainly fun.
And I wouldn't mind living like I used to be alone.
But I want my children to study well and go to school.
To give them more opportunities, I have to sell better and earn much more.
But if nothing changes, I won't be able to make them happy.
Oh, I wish they offered to shoot in advertising or a movie.
Let's have a bigger company.
Maybe you'll find ice cream cheaper first?
I'm going to practice.
See yourself well.
Listen, doesn't an idol earn a million a month?
No, much less.
But why?
My idol.
The fees for songs and appearances on the air are shared among the participants.
And concerts are generally in vain if you don't sell merch.
They also calculate the cost of costumes.
Few people earn so much.
It's not fair!
Where does the world go if the most hard-working don't get anything?
Oh, right!
You have to ask the fans to sell their organs and give them money.
Sometimes your ideas are scary.
Stop thinking about this post-apocalyptic cult.
She sings and dances well, beautiful.
She trains endlessly.
She repeats dances even at home.
Bikamachi is a successful group, and yet ...
Hey, manager!
Why don't they offer work?
Terrible management!
Work on marketing!
It's easier to say than to do.
After all, an idol group is just a bunch of people
who have to fight against the solo performers.
We always sell as a group, you know?
And those who want to work separately are faced with many obstacles.
Many who have left have not found work.
They had to work in expensive bars and restaurants in Roppongi.
Or, for example, did you know that some former idols
were hired as waitresses in Minato?
I didn't know.
Tokyo is a terrible place.
I admit, AI is very, very good.
But it's fair only for AI as an idol.
In the world of show business, it is simply necessary
for you to stand out from the crowd.
In fact, good offers are not just from Bikamachi,
but from those who want to see AI.
For this, it is not enough to be just a good idol.
AI, you look upset.
You just got better.
Don't worry, okay?
What? Everything is fine.
I just missed lunch.
Here I am, hungry.
What kind of lover to eat now?
Shall we repeat the last part?
Come on.
I don't want anything today.
I'll see what you write.
I don't want anything today.
I don't want anything today.
I don't want anything today.
I'll see what you write.
AI's smile is just a fake desert.
I don't even know what to think.
It seems to me that she does not reach humanity.
I can't support such people.
She beats the sick.
Congratulations, Bikamachi.
Advertising!
Mini concert!
The ticket to it is being played inside!
This is the first time I see my mother perform live.
Listen carefully.
I took you just because you didn't leave.
But if anyone finds out about this, I'll be the one to blame.
Got it?
AI's fan forever.
No screaming, talking and running.
Don't take your nipples out of your mouth.
And don't stick out.
She's right, Ruby.
We can't do what will attract attention.
If we somehow reveal that we are connected with AI, then ...
I know.
You also saw what a gloomy mother was.
I'm here because I'm worried about her.
And not just to have fun.
We have a guest.
Three idols from Bikamachi.
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!
Bikamachi!
Bikamachi!
Let them talk as they want.
I'm a professional.
Besides, I don't understand what it is about.
The fans like what ordinary people don't have.
I stand in front of the mirror for hours and check everything to a millimeter.
Open eyes, corner of the lips.
Everything is calculated.
I smile so much that I like it the most.
I'm a hundred percent sure.
What are they doing? These are fan dances!
I can't believe they're children!
They said they were just worried,
and they enjoy the concert the most!
The instinct has taken over!
Wow, that's cool!
My children are so cute!
210 thousand retweets!
And there are already 2 million views on the video!
Video with children is easy to grow,
but to be so...
Let's go talk.
Stop, did Aya always smile like that?
My opinion about her has changed a lot.
I'm a little scared, what a terrible energy these children have!
Here it is.
Do you like it?
Then you should remember.
A year has passed since then.
We have grown up, and now we can go and talk without causing suspicion.
And my sister...
Mom, mom!
Yes?
Hold me!
Like this!
She has completely turned into a spoiled fan,
who calls her an idol of her mother.
Oh, pure land of perfect bliss!
Wow, how do you know such a difficult phrase?
It can't be!
Well, I...
Did Aya really start to guess something?
Ruby, are you a wonderkid?
However, no, so we live an ordinary peaceful life.
Gena, probably.
From modeling to radio work,
Aya gets more and more offers,
and today's work can strengthen her success.
How cool! Mom will be in the series!
But the video is small.
Hey, you, listen carefully.
I took you because you begged me.
But don't even think of calling Aya mom on the set.
Don't forget to pretend that you are my children.
Yes, yes, mom, mom, hug me.
And me too, mom!
Mom, give me money.
I'm Aya from Strawberry Productions.
I'll be glad to work with you.
And we too!
Something wrong, director?
No, nothing.
Is he scary?
And don't tell me.
Whose children are they?
These are mine.
So the manager brought the children to work?
Another work reform?
What?
Well, and you?
Well, and you?
Well, and you?
Well, and you?
What?
Well, and you?
Well, and you?
Well, and you?
Yes, of course, no problem.
Yes, of course, no problem.
Yes, children will not be delivered freedom.
Little foxes!
Cute!
I saw her on the cover of the magazine.
And she is a rising star who is praised for her talent.
Aku, aku!
Stop it.
I can not, I'm too tired.
Oh, you're the child of the TV-manager, I don't mind that you're here, but if you make a noise on the set, I'll kick you out.
Oh, come on! I would never do that! Although we are children, we will never allow such a nuisance!
I understand perfectly well that you cannot be distracted from work, so please think about further cooperation with the SAI!
Wow, how chatty! And where did you learn so many words?
On YouTube, probably.
YouTube is amazing! What a progress!
I saw a lot of gifted children, but they were not standing next to you. Did you happen to play somewhere?
No, I'm not very good at acting.
It would be interesting for you to try. I want you to film somewhere. Here is my business card. Call me if you agree with the agency.
No, if you offer work, then offer better than the SAI.
Oh, that idol. She has a good face. If she is lucky, she will stay afloat.
She still needs luck.
Look, there are three types of actors. Look here.
The first type is stars. Their purpose is to attract viewers.
Such become the face of the film and earn a lot.
Other are real talents. They are needed to maintain the quality of the show.
They support the brand by speaking on behalf of it.
And finally, the newcomers. They do not expect acting talent from them.
They just need to bring freshness to the picture.
Also, this is a chance for them to gain experience.
A kind of investment in the future of actors.
In short, all newcomers are here only at the very beginning of the investment.
And then they will either like the audience, or they will be replaced by a new wave of newcomers.
If at least one of them succeeds today, it will be a huge success.
Here is our world. Only the best in their business survives.
Oh, then everything will be fine.
Oh, after all, a first-class idol.
No, even this may not be enough.
Director, everything is ready for filming.
Okay, I'll watch from here.
Get ready!
What are you talking about?
Do you want me to invite Tom instead of you?
Hey, don't even think about it!
But we are all together all the time!
Her skills are average, but the eye cannot be taken away.
Exactly! She said something recently.
On stage, I should look perfect, no matter what angle I look at.
But it's easier here. The camera is directed only in one direction.
If my clip techniques work, then success is guaranteed.
Well done! I will support you!
I don't like this music video.
Well, temporary.
What? They are just top class! You should watch!
I owe you the discs!
Well, calm down.
It's too early. Don't forget. Never forget.
Mom, I can't wait!
Yes, we've already done so many takes.
Here we go.
It's starting!
Are you upset?
No, I'm not.
Ah! Now they will show!
What's the matter?
Mom, they showed!
Well, come closer!
Tom, wait!
Why are you here?
That's why I didn't want to see you!
What? But why?
What? And that's all?
Just one small scene?
They almost cut everything out!
Apparently, I played so badly.
No, it can't be!
Yes?
Director, why would you do this?
Ah, a gifted child!
You didn't show at all!
Ah, that's about it.
It turned out well. It's a pity, of course.
Well, then why?
The company promotes the main actress,
calling her incredibly cute and talented.
What do you think will happen
if an even cuter girl appears with her in the frame?
This will spoil her image.
Oh, it turned out to be too cute for the screen.
Therefore, we were told to cut out most of the scenes
with her during editing.
How so?
The time of the show is determined by the company's popularity.
So it's better to just forget.
But I can't forget.
It's good to dream about the show business,
but it's better not to feed on false illusions.
Here, the main thing is not the skill,
but the ability to run a business.
But I understand that you feel and regret it.
I wouldn't say that in return,
but I want to offer myself a job.
A movie, to be more precise.
Really?
But with conditions.
You'll be in the movie too.
So, my dear,
in Japan, the decision to cast
is almost always made by the management.
The higher the budget, the less failure is allowed.
In order to choose a cast that will give views,
the management will eventually argue.
Directors who can choose the cast themselves
or work on low-budget or short films.
And who do I look like to you?
On a big bump?
No, I didn't guess.
We're shooting a low-budget movie.
Director, thank you for watching Aqua today.
No, you're welcome.
By the way, have you already taken care of everything?
Yes, Aqua has been a member of Strawberry Productions since this month.
I don't have enough money for an actor who isn't in the agency.
If you need someone who will perform well,
you'd better choose a sister.
No, I need you.
I gave Aya a role in exchange for your participation.
We'll call it Barter in the movie.
Try to remember.
Barter Aya and her son.
It seems you really liked that director Aqua.
And how did you manage to turn it around?
I didn't do anything special.
The old men like it when the young people talk to them.
I just try not to be annoying.
Sometimes you scare me.
I often had to work with the old men at work,
so I got used to them.
Who would have thought that I would need these costumes?
Mom! Mom!
I want to go back to Mom!
Why isn't Mom here?
Because Aya is filming another day.
I want to go back to Mom and hug her!
I want them to love me and hug me!
She's not ashamed to behave like that.
Especially since she's not a child.
There's a shooting site here.
We work here, not play games.
I'm Arima Kano. I'm in this movie.
Oh, I know you.
How was it?
A genius child who can cry in court.
A genius child who can make anyone cry!
Everyone says I'm great in tearful scenes.
And they're right.
You know, I don't really like her.
She's so fake that it makes me sick to look at her.
Sometimes people are very strict with children actors.
For example, you.
I know who you are.
You got here by connections.
When I read the script,
there was no idol in it.
Even Mom said the director dragged you.
It's just unheard of.
Well, I wouldn't say so.
I looked at the frame that the director was shooting.
The idol was not given screen time at all.
I'm sure she played so badly
that she had to cut out the scenes with her.
It seems to lick up everything she can.
Hey, you, take my bag.
Brother!
I know she's just a child.
I won't kill her.
In short, the film tells
about a girl who didn't like her appearance.
And she chose a strange clinic
deep in the mountains to do a plastic surgery there.
We play terrible children
who meet her at the entrance to the village.
Welcome, our guest.
Hello.
We welcome you.
Please, wait a little.
You...
As expected from the genius.
Are you not happy that we are children?
If I try to repeat after her,
the difference in skills will be clearly visible.
Even such an amateur like me will understand it.
What should I do?
The usual answer was just to behave unusually.
But this is not what he wants from me.
I have to guess the right answer.
In our village, there is only one place for a night out.
Maybe first take it off
and then walk around the village.
This scene was added at the last moment.
Only after the director decided to add me to the script.
If I want to guess what he wants,
it's better not to play at all.
I have to believe his opinion.
He didn't say that,
but I understood what he wanted to tell me.
You don't have to play.
You are already quite funny.
Well, let's go after me.
Filmed! Perfect!
Yes, great scene!
He just behaved as usual.
Wow!
I got goosebumps on my back.
Really? That's good.
It's nothing good.
Free the space in front of the camera.
Let's continue filming.
Director, make another take.
Why? Everything is already so good.
It's not good!
My game was much worse than his.
Please, do it again.
I beg you.
I promise I will play better.
Please, do it again.
Hanna!
Hey, gifted,
what do you think is most important for an actor?
Maybe an actor's skill,
motivation and effort.
It's all important, of course.
But the most important thing is skills and communication.
If you don't like an actor or a film crew,
you won't have a job.
If you take away your nose from childhood,
you won't have a future career.
Did you want to warn her?
No, I didn't think of anything like that.
But this can give her food for thought.
Your game today was what I imagined it to be.
She played much better than me.
I just behaved as usual.
Even so, I never told you what to do.
Understanding someone without words is also an important skill.
Of course, understanding the play
and playing according to this basis is the basis.
But the most valuable thing is an actor
who can understand what is not covered in words.
In the mind of a producer,
there is always an ideal way of performing.
So it's better not to be able to play well,
but to understand and play as the director wants.
But I don't want to become an actor.
That's how I entered the show business world.
What a suitable name for the scene!
Aqua!
I won't forget!
Next time I'll be better!
Since I was reborn as Aya's son,
three years have passed.
The film shot by the director received good reviews
and he was even nominated for the director's award.
I remember these shots.
I think I played pretty well.
What else?
In the film, Aya shone brighter than the stars in the sky.
I don't know if the film helped her,
but she began to act more and more like an actress.
In general, Aya is now
the real rising star of the show business.
At least it seems to me.
Soon she will turn 20.
We continue to live quietly,
hiding from the attention of the public.
And my body has never been found.
You are as always cute!
Super cute!
Mom, but you are still cute on your own!
Again for your own!
We started going to the kindergarten.
By the way, who were you before you were reborn?
And how old are you?
Let's see.
And if it turns out that I'm younger?
And how did I not guess that you are a child?
From this moment on, you will obey me in everything!
I'm actually an adult girl!
And asking a girl her age is terribly impolite!
And who cares about the past life?
Enough questions!
Well, perhaps you are right.
I am oppressed by the thoughts of my past life.
And that's how much I don't like the present.
Compared to life with endless work,
life to schoolchildren,
in which I can do everything I want,
is just bliss.
But I don't understand
how she plays so much all the time.
Look, the schoolboy reads such a difficult book!
Guys, we will soon have a holiday in the kindergarten!
And soon your parents will come to see
how you dance!
Let's try to be famous!
Yes!
No, I don't want to!
Ruby!
Why did you run away?
Because I don't know how to dance.
Or rather, I've never tried it.
Have you been locked up all your life?
And children!
You can really say that you are locked up.
I tried before, but it didn't work out for me.
I don't think I can dance.
I don't know what you had to go through,
but are you sure?
You have a long life ahead of you.
Oh! Are you going to learn dance?
Do you want your mom to dance with you?
There will be an old song at the next concert.
I want to repeat it!
Yes, you can do it!
And you can become a professional dancer.
I can't help it anymore.
I can't stand it anymore.
I can't stand it anymore.
I can't stand it anymore.
I can't stand it anymore.
This is the second song. I want to repeat it.
Mom, the movements are a little different.
Really?
In that performance, you raised your hand a little higher.
Wow! Did you watch the recordings of my concerts?
I'm surprised you remember.
Of course I remember.
I saw these recordings a hundred times.
No, a thousand times.
I remember everything until the last movement.
And how do you do it?
Look, you did it like this.
Are you okay?
Yes.
Ruby, you move like that, as if you fall at any moment.
It's like this.
I fell again and again.
And every bad fall was painful.
If you're afraid to fall, you'll only fall harder.
Stand straight.
Drink your chest.
You can do it.
Believe me, mom, okay?
I spent most of my life in hospital wardrobes.
My body didn't listen to me, and I could barely move.
Lying in bed, I could only look at her.
Mom was moving so smoothly.
I remembered all the movements until the last one.
And this blinding light was reflected in my eyes.
Oh, my light!
If only I could move like that!
If only I were free!
More!
More movements!
With my new body!
I can finally dance!
So, she's good not only in acting.
She has a feeling of dance and appearance, which she got from her mother.
I saw something scary.
Well, yes, think about it.
I decided to call the one I broke up with a long time ago.
You know, our children have already grown up so much.
Don't you want to see them?
No, I don't.
I'm not trying to.
One day I accidentally overheard the children talking about their father.
I'm trying not to get involved in this.
But it's still interesting, who is our father?
Oh!
And my heart hurts from one thought about it.
What a fool!
And you're worried about such a trifle?
Obviously, this is not a bad start.
Mom never had a boyfriend.
They came to a strange conclusion, and it seemed to me that this was not a good start.
The children are very smart.
I'm sure they'll understand us.
Of course, now we live on...
Tamay!
Let's take a picture!
How much do you love Shai?
The work is going well.
And I have more than a million subscribers.
Now the whole world is watching me.
Oh, no, it's better this way.
It's better this way.
It's better this way.
Oh, no, it's better this way.
Good drinks.
Well, celebrate with us.
Don't be shy.
Wow, it's Marisa.
She can't yet.
Ai will be 20 only in a week.
I'll have to wait a little longer.
Okay, you're right.
Famous drama with the participation of Ai in the Bicomatch.
Drama with Ai at the top of the rating.
And the schedule of the Bicomatch is set for a month ahead.
And next week we perform at the arena of the house.
The director is so happy.
That's right.
He always dreamed that his idols would give a concert on a big stage.
And not only him, but all of us.
And what's so special about the house?
It's much bigger than other venues.
In addition, in order to get a place there, you need to try very hard.
They need staff with a lot of experience to cope with all the spectators.
And there is a strict selection for those who perform there.
You need to put a lot of effort and time to get there.
You just can't pay.
Only the chosen ones can step on this stage.
It's a dream of any artist.
Wow.
The more sales, the happier.
So I will smile with everyone.
Now is a very important period.
Try not to cause scandals.
And don't even think about meeting with their father.
Of course.
I'm a terrible liar.
I say the most appropriate words without even thinking.
Sometimes I can't distinguish real feelings from lies.
Mom, pet me.
Okay.
I never managed to love before.
You don't have to do anything.
I thought that the role of an idol didn't suit me at all.
You don't have to do anything.
I'm looking for someone.
To be an idol? For me?
Funny, funny.
You see, my company and I want to create a group of middle school students.
I think an ideal leader would come out of you.
No, I'm not interested.
You are just created for this, I guarantee.
You'd better forget about me.
Besides, I grew up in an orphanage.
I used to have only mom,
but once when I was little, she was arrested.
That's how I ended up in the orphanage.
But then, even when she was released,
she didn't come back for me.
I thought that if I scared him,
he would immediately leave.
But it's not so bad.
They don't beat at least in the orphanage.
I don't remember ever loving someone.
I can't become an idol.
I thought that idols should
shine with kindness
and be happy with the smiles of all their fans.
But my fake smile is a complete opposite.
I can't love my fans.
And they won't love me.
So what?
Just ordinary girls are not suitable for such work.
And your story is unique.
But idols all the time say that they love someone.
I'll have to lie.
There's nothing wrong with lies.
In fact, fans only want good lies.
Art of lying is also a talent.
It's all right.
Well, agree.
Can I?
Even if it's all a lie,
can I say that I love?
It seems to me that you would like to love someone.
You just don't know how.
And you can't find out who exactly.
If you just sing and dance beautifully,
you will already show your love to your fans.
And if you become an idol,
the words about love will flicker more and more often in the lyrics of the song.
And maybe if you continue to lie about love,
one day the lie will be true.
The lie will be true?
Hearing these words, I decided to become an idol.
I wanted to love someone.
And for someone to love me.
I thought that if I became an idol, I would be able to love the fans.
To say from the bottom of my heart once, I love you.
I was constantly lying about love.
I thought that if I became a mother, I would be able to love my children.
But I never told them that I love them.
I was afraid that if I said these most important words,
they would turn out to be a lie.
That's why I'm lying again today.
I hope that the lie will be true.
Even if one day I cry for it.
I can't wait for today's concert.
The director is here.
Coming!
Congratulations on your performance at home.
How are your twins?
They all look so beautiful.
They look so beautiful.
I love you.
Happy birthday!
I love you too.
Happy birthday!
Happy birthday!
Happy birthday, dear Tanya!
Happy birthday to you.
Happy birthday to you, Tanya.
Happy birthday, Tanya.
Not cool.
Do you think we're gonna be able to register for the watch?
yl
What pain?
It hurt more!
It is a terrible pain!
You dared to have children as idols!
You haveflew your fans!
Oh God!
You did not exist at all,
I'm sure you were happy to see us!
You're a damn liar! You've been fooling us with your stupid love! It was all a lie!
I was so irresponsible. I'm innocent. I'm a dirty liar.
And I don't even know what it's like to love.
And instead, I lied just to please others.
I hope that one day the lie will turn out to be true.
I've been trying so hard. I've been working so hard. I've been lying with all my might.
For me, lies are love. I showed my love as best I could.
I don't know if I managed to love you and the others.
But I sang my songs with all my heart, hoping for it.
Hoping that I could truly love.
Even now, I still want to love you.
You're a liar. You don't even remember me. I just want to save myself.
You're a wimp. You often came to my concerts. Or did I make a mistake?
I'm sorry. I don't remember the names very well.
I was very happy when you gave me that star. It's still in my room.
What the hell? It's not true!
Hurry up!
I called an ambulance!
I'm so relaxed. Why do I need a chain on the door?
They didn't teach me that at home.
Don't talk! It's bleeding from my stomach.
I'm sorry. It's probably the end.
Are you all right? Did you get hurt?
No.
I wonder if they'll cancel today's concert.
Everyone will probably be upset.
The shooting schedule has also been cut off.
I'm sorry to the director.
What happened? What's going on there?
Don't look, Ruby.
Tell me!
Ruby, your dance at the party was very beautiful.
You know, maybe one day you'll be able to become an idol, too.
The idol's daughter has also become an idol.
It sounds interesting.
How will you become an actor?
I wonder what you will be like when you grow up.
I really wanted to see you go to school.
I really wanted to see you go to school.
I wanted everyone to ask why Ruby was such a young mother.
I really wanted to see you grow up.
I wasn't a very good mother.
But I'm still glad I gave birth to you.
And I have something else to tell you.
Ruby, Aqua, I love you.
Yes, I finally said it.
I'm sorry you had to wait so long.
It made me feel so much better.
Finally, it wasn't a lie.
Today Aya, the leader of the idol group Bicamachi, was killed.
This morning, a man with a sharp woman told us about the man at dawn.
Upon arrival, the police found Aya bleeding from a live wound in her stomach.
She lost consciousness from the loss of blood.
Later, in the hospital, they reported her death.
It is assumed that the culprit was her partner.
A few hours later, he attempted suicide and died in the hospital.
According to the police, Aya recently moved.
This is why investigators believe that the culprit had a accomplice.
Also, her today's concert at home was canceled.
And before the entrance, the fans gathered to honor her memory.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Sensational news about the murder of idol Aya and the death of her killer spread over the course of an hour.
Most people sympathized with her death.
However, as I was afraid, there were those who thought it was funny, trying to draw attention to themselves.
Among so many different assumptions, there were those that were close to the truth.
How is this not surprising?
Why?
If an idol loves someone, then it's not surprising if they kill her?
What kind of nonsense is this?
They themselves fall in love with idols.
Why then can't an idol fall in love with someone?
You're just angry that you can't get a girl yourself.
Disgust!
Stop it!
Why is the Internet so cruel?
After mom's death, I want to die myself.
Why should famous people endure all this filth?
What else is the price of fame?
Guests are always right, but this phrase was not invented for bastards like you!
Don't you dare say words that are usually said to those who have been hurt!
Only never do you hurt others yourself!
Three days later, people began to forget about the incident.
And after the news about the early snowfall that caused the traffic jam,
her story was stopped showing news.
As if the snow had covered the death of Ai.
What about us?
The director and his wife seem to have taken us under care,
so the journalists left us aside.
Considering my age and the fact that the criminal was already dead,
the police limited themselves to only a few questions.
But the conversation with the psychologist was still long.
Do you really want to become my children?
Of course, your mom Ai will always be your mom.
And you don't have to consider me your mom.
But for me, you will be my own children.
Well?
Three days later
Marisa.
Mom said that one day I could become an idol.
What do you think? It's very difficult.
What's the point?
If you want to make money, any other job will be easier.
Besides, the fans are terribly selfish and will tear you to pieces if you lead the guy.
Yes, but still, mom shone so brightly.
It's too early or too late to recover.
During all these years spent together, I realized that she was pure-hearted.
But I...
I was already dead once.
Why do I need the world without Ai?
The stalker and my killer are one person.
But how did he find out what hospital Ai was in?
How did he find out her new address?
The killer is just an ordinary student.
He couldn't find out about all this himself.
Someone leaked information to him.
And it was someone close to Ai.
If I'm not mistaken, only the director knew about the hospital.
But he would treat those he valued so much with the face of his own company.
Someone from the idols?
No, the members of the group were not so close to Ai.
And she didn't have any friends.
And she didn't have any relatives either.
And if they were, she didn't have any contact with them.
So it's just our father left.
She carefully hid his identity from the director.
But given the circle of communication between the two of them,
it's probably someone from the media.
He and I are connected by the same blood.
I can find him using the DNA test.
It was he who made Ai go through all this pain and misfortune.
It's not the time for me to die yet.
Not before I find him and finish him off with my own hands.
The smoking zone.
Director.
Oh, you're a gift.
To be honest, I don't even know what to say.
No, it's not necessary.
Can I ask you for a favor?
What favor?
Could you be my apicoon?
Let's go.
Why are you taking so long, Ruby?
Wait a couple of minutes.
The shape is cute, but we're very confused.
But it's very cute.
Don't make us be late on the first day.
Isn't the skirt too short?
It's up to you again.
I'm sorry, Ruby.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Isn't the skirt too short?
It's up to you again.
You look like an old man.
Oh, right.
Mom, we're going.
Our introduction has come to an end,
leaving the stage of a new story.
And together with that,
the famous beginning of my cruel revenge.
The media is dancing with an invincible smile.
The secret of the city base is mysterious.
Even the missing place is her area.
You're perfect and a liar.
You're a genius idol.
What did you eat today?
Which book do you like?
If you're going to play, where are you going?
I haven't eaten anything.
That's a secret.
No matter what people ask, it's a lullaby.
It's simple, but it's sour.
It doesn't look like miso.
It tastes like honey.
No, no, no.
This is also no, no, no.
The type you like is love.
Now answer me.
I don't know who I like.
I don't know if it's a lie.
I fall for that word again.
I make you like me again.
Everyone's taking your eyes away.
You're a perfect and ultimate idol.
You can't show up in this forest.
You're the best replacement.
If you love with that smile,
Everyone will be a chicken.
Even if those eyes and those words are a lie,
It's a perfect love.
Is the recording going on?
Okay.
I thought it would be better to record it on video.
When you grow up,
it would be great to watch it together
with a glass of champagne.
Although by that time, I'm unlikely to be an idol.
Maybe then you'll be an idol.
You're my children.
Everything can be.
But no matter what,
please grow up healthy.
This is my only wish
as your mother.
