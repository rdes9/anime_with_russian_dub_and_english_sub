        <pre>That's right, it's simple, but it's sour
I can't see it with my eyes, the secret is the taste of honey
That's right, it's simple, but it's sour
I can't see it with my eyes, the secret is the taste of honey
I don't know who I'm going to fall in love with
I don't know if it's a lie or the truth
I fall in love with that kind of words again
Everyone's eyes are being stolen
You're the ultimate item of perfection
I can't see it with my eyes, the secret is the taste of honey
I fall in love with that kind of words again
Everyone's eyes are being stolen
You're the ultimate item of perfection
It was raining, the drops slowly flowed inside the building
The water was even at the shooting site
But the shooting crew was able to avoid the puddles
They thought it all out during the rehearsal
The place of my appearance, the environment, the position of the camera, the lighting
And even the way I'm going to look at the camera
The place of my appearance, the environment, the position of the camera, the lighting
And even the way I'm going to look at the camera
We need to repeat this scene one more time
We're continuing the shooting
All cameras are ready
The lighting is set
Microphones too
Scene 6, frame 51
Camera, engine
The start button before the start
The start button before the start
The start button before the start
Camera on
The air on the site is getting heavier
It's as if a whole year has been pressed for a second
The time is flowing so slowly that it's almost dying
The whole life is not concluded at this moment
My name is Tariya Makano
When I was little, I was called a genius and surrounded by attention
You were shown on TV
You're so cool, Kana
Thank you
Golden days, Arima Kana
But...
I don't know if it was about my talent
In the caprices of the audience or the shortcomings of my efforts
But sooner or later, everyone loses their popularity
Now on the Internet, I have long been buried in the past
In fact, my career ended in elementary school
But I clung to all the opportunities and finally got into the main role
I will make a good TV series at any cost
Even if I have to grab the straws
The straws?
I know everything
I understand that the series will be disgusting
The game without the slightest talent
The first four episodes have already come out
Most viewers are disappointed
The series has already been stalled
But even so, it's not too late
This scene is the most important in the whole manga
The collision of the hero and the stalker
For a girl who did not know love, for the first time someone entered
And she cried from happiness
I love this part so much that I read it over and over again
And cried every time
If I can adjust to other actors
To make the scene better, then everything will work
Leave me alone! Stop following me!
And again you are the same
Play with him?
I will not leave you
It is impossible not to hide his shortcomings
And why does the director and the group arrange this?
This scene should be much more tense
Scary and dramatic
Do they really have nothing to do before the game?
I need more
The microphones capture his steps in the puddles
Should I stop the machine?
No
This sets the right mood
This girl is not what you think she is
She will never be with such a stupid handsome guy
What? It seemed to me on the rehearsal that he played not so well
But we are just the same
The feelings are the same as in the manga
I do not have the same talent that Ai had
She has no captivating aura
And I can't play
I have to use everything
Equipment, cameras, light, actors
I will compare myself with them
I will compare myself with Ai
You are close and not so good
What miracles Photoshop does
What? What did you say?
Are you deaf? I told you that she is not worth your effort
What is he doing? Improvising right during the shoot?
Let it be
Fix the second camera and add a little light
She is my most precious friend
It turns out just like in the manga
This is the most important scene
The setting, the structure, the tempo
It all matters
I have always been good at guessing from the ideas of the author
If you understand the work correctly, you will get a good rating
Come on, I prepared a scene for you
This is your chance
Now everything is in your hands, Arima Kana
You will not change anything, no matter how hard you try
The culmination of this scene is the moment when the heroine starts to cry
To make it shine as bright as possible, I will play it
Just stay and get out of here
Scary, disgusting
Nobody needs you in this whole world
Know your place, garbage, stop living your dreams
You have no future, your life is just a pitch black darkness
And here is the final
Arima Kana just needs to cry
Let it be
Let it be
I believe in her color
That's right
She has no equal in this
I'm sorry, I hit you after all
I didn't mean to
You don't have to apologize
I hit you on purpose
What?
The main thing in the game is to know your emotions
You did well
Thanks to this, Arima had a chance to show himself
Yeah, but he messed up
I'll have to make a whole bunch of changes
Well, let it be
After all, working with newcomers, you have to change the script all the time
So I was ready for this from the very beginning
I think the scene will turn out to be good, and Kana will be happy
Kana, are you ready for the finale?
Kana?
Yeah
Scene 7, frame 310
Camera, engine
The heroine's face in love with the protagonist
The heroine's face in love with the protagonist
The heroine's face in love with the protagonist
The heroine's face in love with the protagonist
Good morning
If you're asleep, you'd better be in bed
You're going to ruin your back
You sleep too tight on the bed
But I wake up on the floor an hour after 4
It's not the most useful piece of advice.
There's work for us.
You can do the background on the second page, and the first two frames on the third.
Okay.
I'll look at the adaptation, so call me when you're done.
Are you still looking at it?
Didn't you watch it?
I watched it in the beginning.
I'm in the second series.
Oh, so you dropped it.
You don't have to force yourself to watch it.
You tried your best to do the manga, and they turned it into a laughing stock.
I just can't watch it.
I knew from the beginning that it would be like that.
The series will end, and there will never be a sequel.
I'm glad that at least such an adaptation came out.
So I have nothing to complain about.
Other authors talked about their own adaptations.
Don't expect too much.
At first, the manga is happy with the long-awaited adaptation of their work.
But in the end, everyone is disappointed.
You can't do anything about it.
So it's better to put up with it.
Let it be so. I believe in her.
What happened?
I'm glad I agreed to this series.
Hurry up! Watch the new series!
Now it's really Sweet Today!
Most of the viewers have already left the series.
Only loyal fans of manga and actors watched it.
The last episode of Sweet Today was not popular and caused a lot of noise.
But in narrow circles, people responded very well to it.
It's booked. The party is Sweet Today.
Oh, who hasn't come here yet?
Only now I realized how many people worked on the series.
Yes, the work of a huge number of people depends on our game.
That's why we have to show a better result and avoid scandals.
By the way, don't you have a girlfriend?
No, there will be no scandals because of me.
Is that so?
I see.
Thank you for your work.
Oh, hello!
I think it was your efforts that made the series like this, Marimo.
Thank you for that.
Especially in the last episode.
It's a pity that it wasn't like this from the very beginning.
Well, hello, Aqua.
Did you like the last episode, viewers?
Thank you.
Although the profit is small, the main goal was to promote young talents like you.
And I think we did it.
I have already received the results of the test of those cucumbers.
The test showed that he is not my father.
And I'm glad in some sense.
Only...
You're from Struber Productions, aren't you?
Your face looks a lot like Aigi.
Are you sure?
Yes. I've crossed paths with her quite often.
I'm sure of everything.
Have you crossed paths with her?
What kind of relationships did you have with Sai?
We worked together when I was the intermediary of one magazine.
Since then, I have often offered her work and helped many.
I met new partners,
suggested a couple of restaurants to arrange meetings in secret from the agency.
Do you know who she met with?
Hmm?
Are you really her fan?
Are you interested in rumors even after her death?
That's right.
So what?
I don't mind telling you.
However, I want something in return.
You have the same beautiful face as Aigi.
Would you like to go to the reality show of acquaintances?
Let's go.
Why are you taking so long, Ruby?
Wait a few minutes.
She's cute, but she's very confused.
But she's very cute.
Don't make us be late on the first day.
Isn't the skirt too short?
Again, like an old man.
Oh, right.
Mom, let's go.
Yota Senior High School.
Entrance ceremony.
And let the next three years that you spend together.
So you're in Class F.
Yes.
Let's go while there are no lessons.
Congratulations on your entrance, Mako.
Well, Ruby, you too.
But remember that even though the Yota Senior High School is not so strict with its students,
if you fail the exams or miss all classes,
you will stay for the second year, as in other schools.
But there is a difference.
That guy is an actor.
There are two members of the famous idol group.
And that beauty with a big chest is a famous model.
And there is Seiya and a streamer.
And here is the model and the singer.
And there on the bench are the artists and actresses Kabuki.
Here are all the stars.
Of all the schools in Japan, most famous people are here.
Welcome, friends.
Welcome to the world of show business.
I'm so worried.
There is no reason for that.
This is not a special school or shooting site.
School is like a school.
Take care of yourself as usual.
Wow!
There are beautiful girls on the right.
There are hot guys on the left.
My little middle school is incomparable.
But it's okay.
You are my mom and genes.
So I won't give up on anyone in appearance.
This place won't break me.
What a beauty!
Oh, I'm sorry for being so cute.
You are very beautiful.
Performing art is something.
No, you are beautiful.
Are you a model?
Yes, I guess so.
My name is Katabuki Minami.
Nice to meet you.
Katabuki Minami.
Wow, you are so popular.
Don't google about me right here.
The size of G is terrible.
Stop it.
By the way, I've never heard of such fairy tales.
Are you from Osaka?
No, I was born and raised in Kanagawa.
And the fairy tale came naturally.
Is it just on purpose?
That's how Minami and I became friends.
That's how it is.
I'm glad to meet you.
Okay, we became friends and it's good.
Did you find your friends, Aqua?
No, besides, I entered this school not to make friends.
Oh, you didn't make friends with anyone.
I'm sorry I touched on this topic.
I won't mention it again.
I have someone to talk to, okay?
Guys don't make friends right away.
Besides, at the general school, everyone is friends with the middle school,
so it won't be easy to get acquainted.
I'm not a loser to make friends on the first day.
Yes, you guys, no one will understand.
Minami, can you make friends with Aqua too?
Of course.
Friendship doesn't work that way.
Don't think about me, take care of yourself.
We are in a special place, everything is different here.
Yes, you're right.
When I remember that everyone around me is right, I feel uncomfortable.
Come on, don't worry.
This is not a special school or shooting site.
School is like a school.
Behave yourself.
Oh, Ruby.
I've heard that somewhere.
Well, judging by the entrance ceremony, there are a lot of famous students here.
But I don't remember seeing anyone on TV, so it doesn't bother me.
No, there is one incredible student.
After class, you will have time to acquire educational properties.
Excuse me.
I was on live broadcast in the morning.
I'm sorry I missed the ceremony.
Shiranui Friel.
Shiranui Friel.
We have Shiranui Friel.
The TV series in which she is filmed is a real hit.
She sings and dances well.
When someone talks about cute girls, it's her.
Of course I know her.
But I didn't think you were so interested in her.
She's my number one.
Why are you mumbling? It's Shiranui Friel.
I'm interested.
My favorite has always been and will be Ai.
Well, mine too, of course.
But Ai is one thing, and Friel is another.
Oh, look, here she is.
Sweetie, even from afar.
You behave like a fan.
You're classmates.
You're right, but...
Hi, Shiranui.
My sister is studying with you in the same class.
Could you please talk to her?
Wait, what are you doing?
I know you.
Are you sweet today?
I'm surprised you know.
This TV series is not particularly famous.
It was talked about a lot at work.
So I watched it.
You were good.
Thank you.
I saw you on the cover of Middle Jump.
You're Minami, right?
Yeah.
Wow.
Shiranui knows both of them.
And you?
I'm sorry, who do you work for?
I...
I don't know yet.
Oh, I see.
Good luck.
Yaman!
Make me an idol as soon as possible!
Don't rush me.
You can't just say that we're creating a band
and start listening.
But then...
I heard she still hasn't worked.
She's just a regular girl.
And how did she get to us?
It's so annoying.
Everyone's going to hate me!
In order to make a good band,
you need a good agent and a bunch of papers.
It's not that easy to find cute girls.
Besides, those who are ambitious
then go to big companies.
That's right.
I want a girl with a big chest
Minami Katabuki.
She's probably in another company.
Never.
Even if she's okay on her own,
I don't need problems with other agencies.
I know someone who's suitable.
She's free.
And despite her fame, she doesn't get any offers.
And her face is cute.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
