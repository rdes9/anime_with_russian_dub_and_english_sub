So, simple, but sour,
you can't see it with your eyes,
the secret is the taste of honey.
There's no, no, no,
there's no, no, no,
the type you like,
love it or not, answer me!
I don't know who I'm going to fall in love with,
I really don't know lies.
In these words,
I fall alone again,
I make people fall in love again.
Everyone is being taken away by the eyes,
you're a perfect, ultimate lover.
I can't show up,
I'm the first to be stopped.
Ah, if I love you with that smile,
everyone will be taken away.
Even if those eyes,
those words are a lie,
it's a perfect love.
So, IFA is starting very soon,
and our leader for it will be
Ari Makana!
Hooray! Let's clap!
Tell me, what is it like to be chosen for this role?
How to say?
First, let's turn off the camera.
I don't want to be the leader of the group.
How much more do I have to tell you about it?
I know what's on your mind.
You decided that if you take off your glasses,
you'll be the leader of the group.
I know what's on your mind.
You decided that if you shoot this video,
then my feeling of responsibility
will not allow me to refuse your ideas.
She understood everything!
Well, you see, we discussed it
while we were still in a group,
and we realized that none of us
would fit into this role.
Especially after I saw
the clip with your songs.
So you've seen them.
Because of the Personal Charges video,
Many people thought that I was a good singer, but they were all disappointed.
Forget it, it's just the voice of the old days.
The dark chapter of my life, in which I did not know how to earn.
What are you, do not exaggerate.
No, we did not sell the truth, we were funny.
Everyone wants to, just forget about it.
The charge with peppers, you really sang not perfect.
But the next song was much better.
And the other one is even better.
You have been training hard.
You tried your best to meet the expectations.
Who is not so responsible to be the leader of the Bikamachi?
Enough!
Do you think if I praise myself, I'll just agree?
But you hold back!
I just can not agree.
As much as you do not ask, I will not be the leader.
Sorry, we got carried away, we will not be anymore.
But listen to at least how we sing.
We are your idols and a sign of our B.
Wow, it turned out great!
Arima, you're just an ideal leader.
But I'm a fan, I will be equal.
I can not! Why do I always agree on this?
Yes, and then it could not be that she will come out something after such an atmosphere now.
And I knew from the very beginning that everything would work out.
Well, now shut up!
I can not believe that you dreamed of becoming idols with such a terrible singing.
Such a feeling would never have been sung, and only the appearance of everything was achieved.
Cruel!
It seems that it is better for me to be the leader.
But I still do not want this.
Okay, and what would you both do without me?
Try not to disgrace me at least on stage.
Of course!
Oh, that's good.
Well, it seems we have agreed on everything.
I always say not what I think, really.
It seems you finally agreed.
Director!
There are a few days before your performance.
It's time to make the last jump.
I asked someone to help.
Do you listen to his advice?
Did someone agree to help?
It can not be!
Is it really Aqua?
Hello!
It's you again!
Oh, hello, Peon!
What? Is it really him?
You are the best employee of the agency!
What do you want? There are no other cases!
I heard that Peon was a professional dancer.
And he also said in the video that he was engaged in choreography for idols.
Seriously?
Tell me, what do you think?
We will succeed.
It seems to me that we succeed.
But we still have a way to grow.
Let's see.
Idols of your level are not often seen on stage.
But if you really want to become better,
you need to become more durable!
Ten climbs to the mountain!
Great! You are tired!
Now dance your whole program!
You need to be ready to perform even if you are worn out!
And do not forget to smile!
Maybe we should switch places
and go around the stage in front of the second verse?
Oh, good idea!
Then if we switch, we will need...
And where did they get so much power from all this?
Do you regret it?
And what happened to Idol?
Oh, Peon!
No, I'm not the idol myself.
I'm not the idol myself.
No, I'm not the idol myself.
No, I decided everything myself.
What to regret?
But I still don't fit for such a thing.
A good idol will not come out of me.
And the leader says nothing.
But you sing well.
Why don't you want to be a leader?
To be a leader means to be the face of the group.
And this role is not for me.
Why do you think so?
I think you are great.
You know, everyone tells me that.
But they don't know anything about me.
And you, what do you know about me?
Let's see.
You are hardworking and always running and singing in the morning.
You worry about your rudeness.
You are more happy when they praise your work, not you.
And you hate pepper.
What? You know so much about me?
Wow!
It turns out he really understands.
I even start to like it a little, drunk.
Are you not my fan?
That's it.
Come on, you're kidding.
So even now I have fans.
I didn't say that I really don't like pepper.
I'm surprised you know.
To be honest, I don't like them either.
They are too strong.
I don't like them either.
They give too strong taste.
Because of them, you don't feel the rest of the dish.
As I understand, when I sang about peppers,
I had to eat them all the time.
Now I can't even look at them.
How unlucky you are.
You don't like the rest of the greens?
I can't stand it.
It's even worse than peppers.
What?
No, I really enjoyed talking to him.
I would never have thought.
It seems like I'm going to fall in love with him.
Maybe, well, it's Vaku.
And start dating him.
Besides, he earns so much.
Why not?
And he is so busy,
but still comes to us every day.
Exactly.
He is not like in the videos at all.
However, it seemed to me that he is very pumped.
And in real life, he turns out to be so built-up.
From behind.
In general, he is just like Aqua.
Oh, I would laugh.
Say, brother, with such a thin eye.
We're doing it.
You're doing great.
Thank you very much, Peon.
Oh, how nice he is.
Not like that nasty Aqua.
Arima, tell me, why don't you love Aqua so much?
And what is it that I should love in him?
He is senseless.
He does what he is supposed to do.
But in fact, he is just a pervert.
So, neither he nor his sister respects the elders.
At least once they addressed me normally.
That's all.
Next time I'll tell him everything.
Well, I'm also a bit older than Arima.
Does she treat me the same way as everyone else?
Eh.
But when he was little, he seemed so cute.
What?
So you've known him for a long time?
Yeah.
Since childhood.
It seems we were three or four years old.
Once you meet such a fool, you will never forget.
What?
Since then, he doesn't come out of his head at all.
He used to seem like an angel,
and now he has grown into such a monster.
He has spoiled all good memories.
The break is over.
It's time to continue.
Let's go.
Their concert is tomorrow.
How do you like their performance?
Well, they have grown a lot.
Rubik is dancing beautifully as always.
And Memche is carefully watching the others.
And Arima learns everything very quickly.
She doesn't make mistakes in movements, even when she sings.
Let them repeat everything again today,
and then they can rest until tomorrow.
Okay.
Thank you very much for your time,
despite the vacation.
You're welcome.
I really liked these girls.
I was just glad to help you.
Although I'm a little surprised.
It's strange that no one noticed that you were pretending to be me.
Impressive.
Are all the actors capable of this?
I don't know.
Those who know how can...
How?
Anyway, why all this?
You could not pretend to be me.
No matter what I tell her, she will not listen.
But if Peon says so, she will definitely listen to him.
I think you should be listened to too.
No, I'm not so good at it.
There's not much left.
Our debut is tomorrow.
What to do?
I didn't sleep.
Be quiet.
You can't.
Go to sleep.
Sleep is very important for health.
The consequences of lack of sleep are still visible for three days.
And according to research, attractiveness decreases by 30%.
If I'm not mistaken, Peon said something like that.
Really?
I'm going to sleep.
But I can't sleep at all.
I'm so worried.
What to do?
It's good that you're waiting for it.
And why aren't you happy about this opportunity?
I don't understand.
How do you stay so cheerful all the time?
No one knows what will happen tomorrow.
A band like ours can easily be hacked
because we went through the connections.
Or maybe no one will come to see us at all.
You seem to be not bothered by all this.
I was just waiting for this so much.
A long time ago, I was sitting in one room day after day and could not get out.
Life without a future or hope.
I thought that I would die like that, never having experienced joy or excitement from life.
But only...
When I found out about Idol, I was filled with happiness every day.
My heart was always filled with joy.
Idol has opened a meaning in my life.
It's a pity that you don't know what it is.
Have you lost so much?
It's okay, I'll survive somehow.
And then I met one person.
Who?
My first love.
Sad happiness again?
He told me something.
If I become an idol, he will be my fan.
Since then, I have always dreamed of becoming an idol.
I wonder where the dog is now.
But I'm sure he still loves idols.
And if I become popular, then surely...
I'm glad for you.
It's good that you have someone to support you.
After all, I don't have such a person.
Everyone sees me as just a child of an actress.
But not the one I became after so many years.
I couldn't think of anything.
It seems that Ruby used to be a nanny.
I just had to go to all the directors.
Piano mask?
He never takes it off on purpose.
But who is still hiding under the mask?
And here we are!
The Japanese Idol Festival!
Let's see.
There are 10 scenes in total at the festival.
We are performing at the Star Group.
There seems to be a lot of underground bands here.
It would be nice to get to the main stage.
Well, we still have a long way to go.
I'm so worried!
I really want to perform!
Everything will work out!
We slept well!
The consequences of lack of sleep are visible for three days.
And the attractiveness, according to research, is reduced by 30%.
That's what I said!
That's what Senpai said!
One said to the second, then to the third, then to the fourth.
Well, given how heavy training matches are,
there is really nowhere without sleep.
Our dance is the most important thing.
You just need to fall asleep.
What to do?
I didn't close my eyes last night.
Okay, let's go to the dressing room.
Hooray!
But who is still hiding under the mask?
Well, he's not so pumped up.
Maybe they've changed?
But why?
So that I am more serious about the rehearsal?
It turns out that his kindness is also a lie?
There's porridge in my head!
And it's on such an important day!
That's it!
I'm definitely done!
I'll go to the dressing room as soon as possible.
Maybe I'll sleep there.
You're going the wrong way!
What?
You can only go to the dressing room at the stage before the performance.
Seriously?
Then where do we change?
Hey, give me your things!
Does anyone have a leash?
What kind of place is this?
Dressing room.
It's so cramped here!
There are so many things in the jar!
At big festivals, it's always like that.
Here you have to fit hundreds of participants.
There's not even a place for luggage.
There's no dressing room either.
Instead, there's a partition.
But it's pretty quiet in the photo zone.
There's chaos everywhere.
Well, of course, the famous groups invited to the festival have their own rooms.
But those who are not so popular have to enjoy it.
If you want comfort, you need to become better.
Okay, we'll be busy soon.
So it's time to have lunch and get ready for the performance.
Okay!
What a tense atmosphere.
How are you?
I just didn't sleep enough today.
Are you really nervous?
Oh, don't laugh.
If only you knew.
I'm in this business.
And I'm still the youngest.
Why would I be worried about this?
I've been watching this crazy couple.
Wow!
Can I talk to you for a minute?
Of course.
Exactly.
I just have to get ready.
I have an 18-year-old experience.
I have to keep an eye on these chicks.
Don't give yourself too much pressure.
Don't be afraid.
Set yourself on fire.
So many people depend on me.
If I fail, the others will fail.
I justify the hopes of those who believe in me.
I remembered it again.
You can't give up now.
Disappointed eyes, so screaming.
Is that all?
Workers in ordinary clothes, sitting in the hall,
so that he doesn't seem so empty.
The pain of those who failed, no matter how hard they tried,
it can't be said in words.
Listen, let's wait a little while with your next release.
Excuse me, but I don't have a job right now.
I agree to any job.
Well, you know, we are engaged in children and actors.
There is no proposal for an actress at her age.
Maybe you should look for another agency?
Your grandfather broke his back.
I will have to return to my parents soon.
You can do it yourself, Kana.
Of course, everything will be fine.
You also need to rest, mom.
I don't need it anymore.
Now I have grown up and I have no fans left.
Who cares about a child who has grown up as an actor?
When did it start?
Since I was a child.
How long have I been talking about myself,
repeating these terrible comments on the Internet?
To be the leader of Bikamachi,
I'm not too sure for someone like me.
But I have no other choice.
I will show them the way.
Oh, Senpai!
Save me, save me!
It's a very bad thing, very bad!
I'm just terribly worried!
What?
It was just a minute ago, there was nowhere to go.
The closer the performance, the worse.
What to do?
Tell me, aren't you afraid?
No, of course not.
How many years have I been doing this for you?
People lie when they do this.
Your hand is so cold.
In fact, you are worried.
Are you crazy?
I'm not so scared that someone like you would feel sorry for me.
The more I'm scared, the louder she yells.
But it made me feel better.
It's even easier when you realize that you're afraid too.
What?
Are you more nervous than I thought?
Everything will be fine.
We all perform together.
That's the point!
That's why I'm worried!
It's all because of you two!
I wouldn't be worried if I performed alone.
I've failed many times already.
But this time you will be with me.
I don't want you to fail.
I don't want you to ever find out what it's like.
That's why I'm so scared.
To be honest, I don't know much about your childhood.
I can't imagine what you went through back then.
That's why you're the most ordinary girl for me.
You're cute and hard-working.
You're an ideal beginner idol.
It's not a failure for us, so let's just perform.
Come on, let's go change!
Come on, Kana!
I'm scared, Kana!
I'm so worried!
But I'm happy!
I'm just a beginner idol.
Beginner idol.
