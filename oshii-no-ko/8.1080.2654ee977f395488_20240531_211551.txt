But I can't see it with my eyes closed
The secret is the taste of honey
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
The type I like is the opposite
Come on, answer me
I don't know who I'm going to fall in love with
I don't know if it's a lie or if it's true
I fall in love again with those words
I make you fall in love again
Everyone is taking your eyes away
You are the ultimate idol
I can't show up in this world
I'm the first one to fall in love with you
I fall in love with your smile
Everyone is taking your eyes away
Even if those words are a lie
It's a perfect love
In the theater company Lalalay, only the best actors perform
And Kurokawa Akane, their rising star
She is carefully preparing for any role
And this allows you to understand and get into the character
And thanks to her natural talent, she can play the role perfectly
And although someone like her has nothing to do on the reality show
She is like an actress
You can call her a hero
Akane?
What's wrong, Aqua?
You look like you saw a ghost
No
Akane! You're finally back!
I'm sorry I had to wait
It's been a long time, we missed you
But now we're together again
Yeah
I'm glad you're okay now, but are you sure you're okay?
What are you talking about?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
What are you talking about?
Well, how do you know?
Oh, you mean the internet poisoning
Yeah, it's not good
But it's okay, it happens
You've changed so much, Akane
Yuki, don't you like me anymore?
No
Aqua, let's talk
Listen, I'm upset
I'm sorry
Okay
Promise
If Akane's back
Say what?
Then i promise
I'll live
I promise
Friends are like any other person
It is clear
I was so happy for him.
Thank you, Aqua.
You're welcome.
The fact that Akane is behaving strangely, that's okay.
But what happened to Aqua?
We need to find out.
Hey, Aqua, give me the bag.
I'm thinking about something.
Take it yourself.
Come on, help her.
Okay.
Here.
See? He only listens to Akane.
Does Aqua really like girls like that?
Akane played her role perfectly.
It's not like that.
Well, tell me, do you like her?
Maybe you like Akane like that?
Enough.
I told you, enough already.
He's looking at me like that.
Are you serious?
Akane, what should we do?
He really likes you.
So, what are you going to do?
Well, I don't even know.
Oh, here you are again, Akane.
If he's serious, maybe you'll answer him in return?
Maybe you'll even start dating?
Well, if you have to choose, then yes.
Then behave the same way even when we're not being filmed.
Seriously?
Seriously.
I wonder what's going to happen next.
I'm not interested.
That's it, I'm tired of it.
I'm not going to watch anymore.
Besides, the idea of watching other people's lives on TV is nonsense.
And all these, oh, who is more suitable for whom?
Are they going to breed horses for skates or watch a show?
That's it, that's enough for me.
I'm not even going to watch the radio.
Bye-bye.
Goodbye.
Mom.
Although I spent many years with Ai,
in the end, I couldn't find out anything about her.
She is incomprehensible, as always.
What was a lie, and what is the truth?
What exactly are we connected to Ai?
Am I a fan or her son?
Or...
I liked Yugi Yuki so much,
and now Akane is even better.
Akane was bright when she came back.
Well, isn't she cute?
I'm sure they'll be able to overcome all the difficulties with Akane.
And how he looks at her.
So cute.
The last episode is coming soon.
I wish the show didn't end.
It became so interesting.
By the way, last season, they kissed at the end.
Wow, I wish it was like that.
Arima.
Arima Kana.
Don't you want to skip school and go for a walk together?
Come on.
I can't believe it.
We're going to school for no reason.
Real criminals.
I can't hear.
We're terrible.
Just terrible.
Then we go back to school.
It's not about that.
You just looked so considerate.
So I, as an elder, decided to put you on the path of truth.
After all, in my soul I am a real angel.
So, where are we going?
To Disneyland?
On the TV tower?
Quite unusual places to walk around the school.
We are in school uniform.
In other places it will attract attention.
And changing clothes at home is too long.
Therefore, I offer her places where the uniform will not be shared.
I meant a little different.
You're strange, Aqua.
Really?
You still ask.
For the guys and girls who finally got out of jail,
playing baseball is the last thing that comes to mind.
And you even bought a ball with gloves.
Definitely strange.
Okay, throw the ball.
And by the way, I've never played this before.
Oh, sorry.
It's okay.
I just play terribly.
Why didn't you call someone who is good at it?
Robbie, for example.
What kind of brother would drag his sister for a walk at school?
You definitely have a complex.
Okay, and someone from Love with a Star?
Are you friends?
Well, we get along.
But this is still work.
Not so close.
I see.
We are constantly lying, counting the next move.
There are not so many people
with whom I can just talk with my soul.
Well, when I'm with you, I can think of nothing.
Wait, Robin.
Okay.
It's not so bad that you chose this role.
It's me.
Filming Love with a Star is coming to an end, right?
Yeah.
Yuki, are you still the most popular?
Although it seems that Kurakawa Akane is also on the rise now.
Tell me honestly, who do you like the most?
None of them. It's just work.
Well, someone you should like.
Younger or older.
Don't ask such difficult questions.
Recently, I understood something.
The way people think depends on their physical development.
I have almost no memories from my childhood because of infantile amnesia.
And now, in the period of puberty,
I became suspicious of my surroundings.
As my body grows,
it gradually restores my distance.
The border between me and Hoshino Aqua is more and more distant.
There is something I wanted to ask, but was very afraid of.
Tell me, maybe you're crazy.
Come on, get out of this Aqua.
I'm sick of it.
I, like you, am an ordinary senior.
It's quite normal that girls of my age can attract me.
Although I have no doubt that I like those who are a little older than me.
So you prefer older people?
Yes.
Really?
Throw the ball already.
So.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
Oh, good throw.
What, really?
I said you don't know how to play.
That's right.
I've never played with anyone except you.
This is my first time.
Maybe I'll be the first to serve as an idol.
But my feelings for Kurakavi Akane are not quite the same.
I'm grateful to Nari.
Thanks to her, I figured out my feelings.
In Kurakavi Akane, I only saw the traces of Ataie from the past.
The shooting is coming to an end.
It's a pity it's so soon.
Since you advised me to play, I've gained popularity.
It really helped.
Thank you.
Your game has no understanding of Aya's feelings, just like a dream.
How did you do it?
There's nothing unusual here.
I read a lot about psychology and profiling.
I just found information about them and made a portrait.
And I figured out some of the features myself.
You figured it out?
Yes.
For example, it turns out that Aya had a child.
It all adds up.
Her feelings and emotions become clear.
This explains her contradictory actions.
It was so interesting to think about what she was like.
It's like you're solving a puzzle.
How well do you understand Aya?
Well, from the way she lived to the way she liked it.
I think I understood everything about her.
In the world of show business, talents are gathered together.
However, Hoshina Aya was kept away from the rest of the world.
Her feelings and thoughts remained a mystery.
I couldn't get close to her decision.
But unlike me, such a talent as Kurokawa Akane,
despite the years spent with me and Aya,
understands her much better than I do.
We have an exclusively working relationship.
But when the show is over, we may not see each other again.
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.
But when the show is over, we may not see each other again.
That's why I use Kurokawa Akane.
I just can't let her go.
Akane, you're just awful.
Why are you such a fool?
The shooting of the beginning of my love with the star is over.
Thank you all for your work.
Oh, my God, how quickly it all ended.
A lot of things happened.
Well, if you say so, Akane, we definitely have nothing to complain about.
So, you don't want to tell us?
You kissed!
Are you really going to date?
So what?
I don't know.
The show was so developed that it seemed unnatural.
But I have a job, so the guy...
Come on, man.
After all, the show is over.
Come on, man.
Even for the stars, it's quite normal to meet someone in high school.
Yui, you must have changed his boyfriend.
Does it really seem so?
In fact, my career has always been in first place.
So I've never met anyone.
Come on.
It seems she's not lying.
Someone from her company said the same thing.
Come on, what kind of innocent?
Models are not as popular as it seems.
Even idols and actresses are not so different from other people in this regard.
Yes, in an agency where relationships are prohibited for the sake of profit, this is generally a rarity.
And sometimes there are scandals.
So you're lucky that it happened at the reality show.
You can now not worry about scandals.
But still...
Yes, that's right.
Take the show as an opportunity.
From this moment on, we will not interfere with you.
Whether to meet or not is up to you.
Some couples continued to meet and eventually got married.
And others have been pretending for several months, which is true in relationships.
Think it over and make a decision.
In the world of show business, many adults will want to use your talent, and then just throw it away.
Some suggestions may seem tempting, but those who are easy to knock down will inevitably end up in real hell.
Here's an advice for you, crying adult.
By the way, where did the bad guy go?
Any of the stars liked the audience.
It turns out I was not mistaken when I invited you to the show.
Perhaps you are right.
It seems that the network scandal helped the show gain popularity.
They say it was you who ate all this porridge.
That video caused a lot of trouble for the management of the show.
In our case, the publication of unnecessary materials is strictly prohibited.
Seeing this, they argued for a long time.
Even if you are a member of the show, you cannot break this ban.
We even discussed the demand for damage from Strawberry Productions.
However, you did not do this, did you?
The actors have the right to upload photos and videos from the filming to the official Show account.
This is in the contract.
That is why I used the official account on Twitter.
I did everything according to the contract.
You are a cunning little one.
Thank you.
Okay, you did your part of the deal.
I have no complaints.
So your reward is waiting for you.
Maybe we'll have a snack for a week?
I'll share with you the information about AI.
I'll find time.
Oh! Aqua! Aqua!
Come with us!
You just can't escape!
It was so much fun!
Listen, Aqua.
What are we going to do now?
What are you talking about?
Oh, that scene is in the episode, so we'll have to meet for a while.
Yes, I understand that, but...
Well, then...
Then, tell me, do we have a working relationship?
Or are we still real?
I wouldn't say it's just work.
Don't hold back, be honest.
Aqua, don't you see me as a girl?
In a romantic sense.
No.
I understand.
It's all right.
You're right.
I really don't love you.
For me, this love is just a part of work.
However, I'm still interested in you as an actress, Akane.
And this is not a lie.
I see.
That's good.
After all, these are the words I wanted to hear the most.
All right, then let's continue to play the couple.
Besides, we already have a real couple.
What?
Didn't you notice?
Yuki and Nobu have recently started dating.
Seriously?
She rejected him on set.
Nobu is on her side, right?
But I like Yuki's accountability the most.
For Yuki, this is the first relationship.
I would never have thought...
Bye! See you!
Good night.
Memo, aren't you on a taxi?
No, I live nearby.
Good grief, I didn't know we were neighbors.
Oh, yeah, a lot of people in the show business live here.
I'm so sad.
I liked working with all of you so much.
Really?
But you don't seem particularly sad.
But you're dating Akane now, right?
We have an exclusive working relationship.
Well, that's probably enough for now.
Who knows, maybe everything will turn out to be serious later.
No way.
Although you say so, I saw you blush when you saw Akane in Ai's role.
And you're doing pretty well.
Bikomachi is a pretty old group.
Of course, everyone loves Bikomachi and wants to be like them.
Don't tell anyone.
But I've always dreamed of becoming an idol.
But for various reasons, I couldn't make it.
Oh well, being a YouTuber is not bad either.
Then you don't want to come to us?
What?
The new generation of Bikomachi is looking for new participants.
Me? In Bikomachi?
Not really.
Episode 8. The first time.
Episode 9. The second time.
Episode 10. The third time.
The End
