3 years ago I was the only one who scared you. She sent me to look after you.
Then why did you attack us?
Well, Izumi ordered me to train you a little.
That's not funny. Wow, a little. We almost died.
Exactly. Is it possible to act like that with children?
Enough! How much can you complain about the past?
I'm sorry.
Teacher.
It's just a child. It may happen that he took the boat from his parents and brought it here.
Then...
Teacher!
Ed, look! Light!
What? He's blind, Edward.
What?
He turned his hand into a stone.
What's this? Where's my clothes?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Where's my clothes?
What are you doing? It's just a child.
Yes, but what if he attacked us?
Attacked? Look at him.
It's not a joke.
Where are you from? Where are your parents?
I don't know.
What's your name?
I don't know. I don't know anything.
I don't know.
Don't cry. It's all right.
When a person wants to get something, he needs to sacrifice something.
In this way, if you want to get something, you have to give something equal in return.
In alchemy, this is called the law of equal exchange.
At that time, we believed that this is the truth that rules the world.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
To be continued...
I'm fine.
Can I sit?
No
No
No
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes
I dez good that both of you came back alive.
I don't understand.
It's not that simple here.
We were taken aback by the teacher's words.
Realizing that we ourselves are no more than a part of the world's flow,
we doubted that the whole world fits inside us and tried to change its basis.
You can't forgive this.
Let go of me!
Come on!
That's not right!
Everyone makes mistakes. I'll tell her anyway.
And I'll ask her, what's wrong with her?
Has she never made a mistake?
Wait, wait, Vina, don't!
Don't!
She knows it herself.
That's why you shouldn't, Winry.
I see.
And what are you going to do then?
Well, there's...
This child?
He says he doesn't remember anything, and the teacher believes him.
But she told the police.
And while they were gathering information, she decided to leave him with herself.
It's good if he just got lost.
The meat is tough.
Ed, let's not do this.
The teacher locked everything with alchemy.
She'll find out if we open it.
Well, then...
Al, you'll fix it later, as it was.
Let's play?
That's great!
Everyone died and it was boring.
They didn't die, they just slept.
How are we going to play? I came up with it.
Do you remember how you played back then?
So it was you who followed us after all.
Where did you come from, huh?
Hey, let go!
I don't want to!
Animal life is not for you.
I don't want to!
Let go!
I don't want to!
Animal life is not a toy for you!
Let's play, let's play, let's play!
Calm down!
I told you to wake up!
Cool!
But you can do it yourself.
Stop lying.
You transmuted a stone on the island.
You also made clothes with alchemy.
Ed, don't talk to him like that.
Al, but you saw it.
He made a transmutation without alchemic circles.
Only I and the teacher can do it.
But the teacher pretends that she didn't see anything.
It's very strange.
Well, try to untie it with alchemy.
Take it off! Take it off! Take it off!
Ed, he doesn't have anything to do with those types.
Take it off!
I already saw his face somewhere.
I saw it for sure.
Ed, what did you do?
I didn't do anything.
So what? Can I grow a human body and a bed?
What kind of noise is that?
Hey!
No! No!
It's not our teacher. It's...
Honestly, Ed likes to lie, but today he's telling the truth.
Well, you know, Al.
I believe you.
Don't you remember that your teacher taught you such a crazy alchemy?
Alchemy?
Well, it's a chimera of two living creatures.
Let me go! Let me go!
Don't scream!
It's all right.
You'd better remember what you looked like.
You just need to remember what you looked like.
Quietly. Quietly.
You two idiots!
You grabbed this child and made such a mess!
I'm sorry, our teacher.
We were just worried.
Maybe he's one of those who hunts for us.
Who, in fact, hunts for you?
The creature...
...is called...
...the Chimera.
The Chimera.
The Chimera.
The creature...
...is called the Chimera.
Thank you for visiting us so often.
Do you like your new job?
Yes, I can work from home.
I now have a free schedule.
You're so cute.
If you're still looking for something...
Don't worry.
I don't have anything to do with dangerous things anymore.
I'm not that careless.
Bye-bye.
Goodbye.
See you tomorrow.
Hey!
Wait!
Colonel?
Maybe you should come get me first.
Well, actually Hengris...
I怪 due.
Are you coming into the house, Hughes?
I cannot visit my dear friend's family.
How can you turn up in front of them?
Do not even look at why your dear friend was killed!
on the eve of the murder somewhere here for sure there must be a reason for which
he was killed here I congratulate you with the transfer to the central and here again
but I don't understand anything and so here is this list of external calls to the central
headquarters there is no code reception of the ministry of justice the secretary of the
führer I don't understand I now have extra trouble from the fact that you lost them I'm very busy
their teacher lives in the city of dublis maybe they are still there for me to go there I can
entrust the passion and gluttony to deal with greed they did not refuse to create another opportunity for them
you are the youngest you give orders as an elder I want these children to create a
philosophical stone, however, we will have problems if they get into the business and the
you understand
why these homunculi will not make philosophical stones themselves they said that they cannot
make it and cannot use alchemy then this child is not one of them so well, but no matter
what kind of alchemy with its help it is impossible to rebuild your body and he is also like a brother
you are a teacher who has had a transmutation without an alchemical circle this is al this is al you probably
don't remember what is it and you should remember the gate I remember
all the same, because I saw it, was it really the truth the truth
then I could not understand what was going on
information of an incredible volume penetrated right into my brain and suddenly I understood everything that I
did not know about alchemy until now it seemed to me that I was one step away from
to get the theory of transmutation of a person
ah
wait for me crowds again there was truth
The one that I'm looking for!
Equal exchange. What does it mean?
What is it?
Damn! It took it!
Mom!
Mom!
No!
I didn't want this!
It's all because of me!
Because of me!
In these gates I realized
that I can still make it.
That I can still...
Ed!
Give it back!
This is my younger brother!
I will give you my leg, or both arms,
or my heart!
Give it back!
He's my brother!
Mom!
When I woke up,
I was already in this body.
What was supposed to become our mom
has already disappeared.
I saw the truth there.
That's why I can make a transmutation
without an alchemical circle.
And I was able to attach the soul of Alla.
And you think
that was the truth?
Why not?
I...
Wasn't it just a puzzle?
Teacher!
I just remembered!
I saw him there!
So he's not a human!
He's something else!
I'll check something.
We'll talk later.
Teacher!
I forbid you to approach this child.
Is that clear?
Izumi.
It's okay. I'll just check.
Please let me go alone.
These children don't know
why homunculi are born.
This is Onion.
How come it's a human?
No one should know that.
You need to be careful.
And what can you lean on for your life?
You'll be your family.
You'll not see your car.
What about what about all the interference
that has occurred here?
회'...
The Major is not here.
Is that so?
He's conducting an investigation somewhere
together with the Chief of Staff
General Hughes in the military court.
And what's the name of this successor?
I think it's Frank.
Lieutenant Colonel Frank Archer?
Do you know him?
He's a man of army spirit.
Is that so bad?
Army spirit means
that he loves war.
Lieutenant Colonel,
I've told you several times already.
Don't you know where the Eilers are?
They've set it up like a typhoon.
There's no proof that they went south.
I already know that they went there.
You've set up a track for them,
but they're not traitors.
Maybe, but I'm not going to
give them such freedom
as Mustang.
War is waiting for us ahead.
Excuse me.
Izumi ordered you not to let me out
under any pretext.
Where did she go?
I don't know.
She asked me to prepare the boat.
Maybe to the island again.
The island?
Why?
Al, what are you doing?
It's ready.
Let me pull out my hair.
Winry, I'm sorry.
We can't leave the room.
Al, is that you?
What have you done to this child?
He's so scared.
Listen, Winry,
maybe it's stupid,
but I want to ask you something.
About this child's body.
Al, what are you talking about?
About this?
I'm also wondering
what happened to him.
The places where the right hand
and the left leg are connected to the body.
Al, what are you trying to say?
Ed, you said you saw his face
on the other side of the gate.
What happened?
It's dangerous if Izumi finds out about this.
We'll finish it quickly.
Guys, you said
not to get close to this child.
That's why we say we'll finish it quickly.
It can't be.
It was an equal exchange.
I created my mother's body
in exchange for the leg.
I attached the soul to the missing Al
in exchange for the arm.
It was an equal exchange.
Where did you get this scar?
This is the mark of a fox bite.
This is my arm.
Wait, Ed.
Edward.
Maybe...
Maybe the arm and the leg
of this child are connected.
The arm and the leg of this child...
Edward!
It's like we'll meet again
in this city tomorrow.
To believe in love
is not to lose to yourself.
Until the day my dream comes true
I'll look at the stars with a smile
and pray for you
because I'm here
I want to be in the sky for you
Even sadness is wrapped around
When I look up at the sky
I realize that I'm not alone
I want to be far away
I want to be in a place where I can return
I want to be in a place where I can return
I want to be in a place where I can return
I want to be in a place where I can return
I want to be in a place where I can return
I want to be in a place where I can return
I want to be in a place where I can return
I want to be in a place where I can return
I want to be in a place where I can return
