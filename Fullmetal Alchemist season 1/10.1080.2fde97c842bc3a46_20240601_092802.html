        <pre>I'm sorry, I have a full house.
Too bad.
Flash Royale.
Oh!
I'm sorry, I have a full house.
Oh!
I'm sorry, I have a full house.
Oh!
I'm sorry, I have a full house.
Oh!
I'm sorry, I have a full house.
I'm sorry, I have a full house.
I'm sorry, I have a full house.
I'm sorry, I have a full house.
Flash Royale.
Oh, it can't be.
I lost again.
Well, that's it, this time I'm sure.
Enough, I'm tired of it.
Ned, what happened?
How many times have you won?
Is it really boring to win all the time?
It's not about the cards.
The problem is Colonel Mustang.
You don't want to meet him?
Of course.
In the end, the Philosopher's Stone turned out to be fake.
We again with empty hands.
Well, well, well.
I can imagine what will happen when I read it.
Oh, this Colonel Mustang,
what scoundrels he will talk to her about.
As soon as you start thinking about it,
your soul becomes restless.
When a person wants to get something,
he needs to donate something.
Thus, if you want to get something,
you must give in return something equal.
In alchemy,
this is called the law of equal exchange.
At that time, we believed
that this is the truth that rules the world.
The End
Thank you for watching!
Please subscribe to our channel!
To be continued...
Is it okay that we got off the train halfway?
Yes, everything is fine.
We don't know where we can find information
about the Philosopher's Stone.
And this is the popular tourism center.
There is nothing wrong
in looking here.
As if we are cheating and walking through the school.
Who is cheating here?
What is it?
Ed, really?
Come on, stop!
Cheater!
Follow her!
Don't miss!
Today we will definitely catch Siren!
That's it!
You have nowhere to run, Siren!
Come on!
Stop!
Ed, what a beautiful city!
That's right!
Visiting Okroi and admiring the water capital
is much better
than looking at the arrogant face
of the colonel in a dusty eastern city.
Do you even see where you are going?
A real water capital!
What do you want?
Come with me to the station!
I have questions.
So you are saying
that you are a state alchemist
and also a famous steel one?
How many times can I repeat?
These watches are the best proof.
If they are real,
they are just a joke like you.
What?
Is this a joke?
Ed, nobody said that.
Hey, hey, stop!
There is an unknown
and extremely mysterious thief
called Siren in the city.
Siren?
We have only one clue.
He uses alchemy.
And you are an alchemist, aren't you?
So I decided that it would be nice
to talk to you.
Well, I'm sick of this shot.
Three hours to ask
the same question.
And what's in his head?
Brother, I can't get rid of
the thoughts of a thief using alchemy.
Ed?
What happened?
I...
grabbed it.
It's a light food poisoning.
So you didn't just overeat?
Leave me alone.
Let's make a shot.
Yes, a shot.
Yes, a special shot.
Ed, don't be afraid.
It's over.
You're not small.
I'll get angry.
Al, don't. Al, will you betray your older brother?
I'll get angry.
Oh, no, they are injections.
Ready?
That's all.
After all, it doesn't hurt at all.
I didn't notice.
So fast?
Listen.
Well, what else?
You need to grow up faster.
Come on...
She is beautiful.
My eyes can not take.
Oh, Al,
you got a taste.
What are you so good at?
Sorry.
Can't swallow a piece.
What?
Let me
I'm going to peel the fruit.
You can do it.
Easy. Like this.
Careful. Give it to me. I'll peel it for you.
Come on, don't be a wuss.
It's ready. Eat it together.
What were you thinking about?
Just...
Clara is not only beautiful, but also kind, right?
She even looks a little like her mother.
What nonsense are you talking about? Nothing in common!
Huh?
I'm sorry.
It's okay. Don't worry.
Please.
You two...
Are you alchemists?
Elric! Mr. Elric!
Why did you come to me? I'm not a thief!
I know, I know.
To be honest, I have a favor to ask of you.
Silence!
Salute to the state alchemist Edward Elric!
I'm scared.
So what were you thinking about?
Oh, I'm sorry about the recent incident.
Everything you said was confirmed by the commander of the Eastern District of Mustang.
So he really is...
Ouch, ouch, ouch.
I'm sorry you didn't recognize me.
Well, I told you.
That's right.
To be honest, I didn't recognize you.
I'm sorry.
So what were you thinking about?
That's right.
To be honest, I have a favor to ask of you.
Additions.
As many as you want.
It will be calmer for us if you, Mr. Elric, go with us.
Today we will definitely put an end to this siren.
Well, let's try to do something.
Actually, it's very crowded here.
Who knows what this thief-siren was thinking.
He sent a message about the planned theft in all newspapers in the country.
Here the newspapers gathered, Zivaki, even his fans.
How popular is he?
His popularity will end tonight.
We will hope for your help, Mr. Elric.
And I will bypass the security check.
Brother, you somehow took up such a job too easily.
I'm just curious, huh?
What is this alchemist fence?
I don't know.
It can't be!
Wait!
What?
Wait!
Wait!
Alchemists have different applications.
But I can't afford to use it for theft.
Besides, I was taken for a thief because of you.
Come on, apologize.
Come on!
I caught you.
Woman!
It's a pity that I can't show you my face.
But I'm pretty.
Damn it! What are you doing?
It's time for the kids to go to bed, my dear.
Who is it here, my dear? I can't see from the ground!
Al?
Al?
Where the hell did he go?
You?
I'm surprised.
The kind nurse on the top turned out to be a siren thief.
No, what are you talking about?
I just came to take the medicine.
Yeah, the medicine, created with alchemy.
What a lie!
What a lie!
What a lie!
What a lie!
What a lie!
What a lie!
What a lie!
It's a shame that you call me a liar.
I'm pretty, like I told you.
What does this have to do with it?
Ed?
Ed, how are you?
Something happened?
What happened? What happened?
It's a siren thief!
Look, the alchemical circle on her chest is the best proof of that.
Everything happens in life.
Guys, maybe you still don't understand.
What?
I understand.
Huh?
I just heard that this hospital is going to be demolished.
Probably for no reason.
To save the hospital, Clara is engaged in theft.
Isn't that right, Mrs. Clara?
Yes, yes.
I don't want to be a thief.
That's all I have left.
After all, I have to save the patients.
That's the way it is.
She's so kind.
Boss, boss!
A new warning! Sirens!
What happened?
What?
It seems that this time the security is small.
The owner of this mansion is a very careful person.
Several special devices are installed in the mansion.
Devices?
You see for yourself.
This time the sirens are definitely the end.
Although anything can happen.
If anything, we hope for you.
Ed?
What are you going to do?
Damn it!
A trap!
Boy!
Why did you help me?
I didn't want to help you.
But it happens that bad things also need to be done.
I think so.
If you can save the hospital ...
What's funny?
Now you talk like an adult.
And I am an adult!
Well, yes.
And I, as an adult woman, am now in debt to you.
Can I do something for you?
I have only one question for you.
Since you are also an alchemist,
you should have heard about the Philosopher's Stone.
If you know something about it, tell me.
I need to get this stone no matter what you do.
Sorry.
But I don't seem to be able to help you.
But if you find out where this stone is,
let me know and I'll steal it for you.
Hey!
It's good that we were able to save the hospital.
Yes.
Yes.
Thanks to you.
What does it mean?
We've been deceived.
It can't be.
Only not Mrs. Clara.
There must be some kind of mistake here.
Some kind of mistake?
Yes, because of this Clara,
the roof is completely gone.
How can you say that, brother?
You can't argue.
This is against God's will.
Clara?
Is that you?
It's a pity that it happened to the hospital.
I did everything to save it,
but I didn't have time.
Unfortunately,
I became a nun.
Clara!
Really?
It's true.
You can save those who believe.
You can save a lot more.
For example,
this monastery.
It will soon be demolished from the face of the Earth.
I knew it.
Let everything work out for this time.
We're on your side.
Brother, what a nightmare!
What's going on?
There's a terrible outburst in the city.
The siren appeared again.
The matter is done.
This monastery is saved.
It's some kind of mistake, right, Ed?
Are you an idiot?
Stop thinking that everyone in the world is good.
This cheater beat us around the fingers
and now she's laughing.
Don't say that.
You can't argue.
Enough, boys.
Hey!
Who are you this time?
I understand.
You have become a school teacher.
Try for the sake of the school,
which will be demolished soon.
Right?
Right, Mrs. Clara?
Yes, yes, yes, well done.
Stop joking.
What kind of person are you?
A thief for his own benefit
and using alchemy?
Or just a criminal?
How can I tell you?
You're an adult, aren't you?
Think with your head.
Hurry up!
The siren sent another warning.
Why are you so happy?
The siren is an ordinary criminal.
What are you talking about?
The siren is a benefactor who saved Okroi.
Our only hope.
Our only hope?
The water capital Okroi
is slowly sinking from year to year.
In five years the whole city will be at the bottom of the lake
and disappear.
For this reason, many ran away from the city.
It was so gloomy here
until the siren appeared.
Thanks to the siren, the city came to life again.
Journalists from all over the country come here.
The number of tourists coming for the siren has increased.
Before disappearing in the water,
Okroi is experiencing his last dawn.
What is it, Ed?
Maybe for the sake of saving this city,
Clara became a thief?
Who knows.
I can only say one thing.
She deceived me,
the steel chemist.
And I will make her pay for it.
The Siren
I knew you would come, baby.
Isn't it wonderful?
A date on the water.
Shut up, thief!
Aren't you the same?
You want a philosophical stone,
don't you?
Do you want to find someone else?
Maybe so.
But there is a difference.
Yes, we are both alchemists.
Only we allow ourselves different things.
I'm starting, baby.
It worked!
The Siren
You did well, baby.
You will surely become a good man.
Then let's fight again.
As a man and as a woman.
Clara,
I want to say something good
about the philosophical stone.
What?
Go to the town of Ksenotaym.
I heard that they are studying
the philosophical stone there.
Ksenotaym?
What else?
Why are you still here?
You should understand.
Clara is just a criminal.
No, it's not like that.
She is not just a criminal.
You said it yourself, Ed.
It happens that evil deeds are needed.
And Mrs. Clara...
Clara is a good person.
You think so yourself.
Tell me, Ed.
Yes, but...
I don't know.
I don't know.
I'm a little hot.
Won't you untie
the lightning on my chest?
I'm a little hot.
Won't you untie
the lightning on my chest?
I'm a little hot.
Won't you untie
the lightning on my chest?
I'm a little hot.
Won't you untie
the lightning on my chest?
I'm a little hot.
Won't you untie
the lightning on my chest?
I'm a little hot.
Won't you untie
the lightning on my chest?
I'm a little hot.
Won't you untie
the lightning on my chest?
I'm a little hot.
Won't you untie
the lightning on my chest?
I'm a little hot.
Won't you untie
the lightning on my chest?
I'm a little hot.
Won't you untie
