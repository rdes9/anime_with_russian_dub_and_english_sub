        <pre>Episode 1
What kind of city is this?
Who are you?
Who are you?
It's not my business.
It's not mine.
Episode 2
Machines that fly in the sky themselves.
It seems that in this world not alchemy, but engineering has developed.
That's why there are so many mechanisms that we don't understand.
What about this world?
Didn't you notice?
We are on the other side of the gate.
Episode 3
A philosophical stone.
Those who have acquired it do not depend on the law of equal exchange.
And in order to get something, they should not give an equal replacement.
We were looking for it and got it.
Episode 4
Machines that fly in the sky.
Episode 5
Machines that fly in the sky.
Episode 6
It seems that something has started in the headquarters.
Because of the interference of the details, it is not clear.
Everything is fine.
We will resist against those forces with which General Hakuro is going to destroy us.
The main thing is that the colonel managed to do everything in time.
But if you think about it, we are hopeless fools.
We can't even imagine what the colonel is doing there.
Lieutenant colonel!
Reinforcements!
Hm?
I'll go too.
We don't need a colonel anymore.
Zhen!
What's there?
Nothing.
Maybe you wanted something else.
I won't tell mom.
Well, what would you like to tell me?
I'm sorry.
Well?
I saw...
Is this some kind of important secret?
I was going to give it to you when you grow up a little.
Seriously?
Yes, but for now, take this.
I just entrusted you with my life.
Protect it as it should be.
Yes, sir, the Fuhrer!
What is it?
They're asking if there were any criminals here.
Senior Lieutenant Hakai, if I'm not mistaken.
I'm honored that you remembered me, Your Excellency.
The main entrance! Hurry up!
Forward!
Let's go!
What?
Where?
Our friends are planning to raise the uprising.
We're going to them.
We're in trouble!
Huh?
What's going on?
We've received a message.
What?
What is it?
We've received a message.
The Fuhrer is in the house!
My Fuhrer!
Your Excellency, I'll be right back.
This world is filled with death.
Here they used toxic gas more than many lives.
Weapons.
The future will be even more effective in killing people.
You've seen it too, haven't you?
All these lives from the past and the future will become a source of alchemy.
A source?
What are you talking about?
Is alchemy...
Equal exchange.
Remember, in order to fix the broken radio,
you need not only the matter of the same mass,
but also the energy to restore it.
If you ignore this, you won't get any equal exchange.
The lives that die in this world pass through the gates
and become the energy for our alchemy.
Here, in us, there are small gates.
Alchemists open them,
connect with this world
and use their lives, turning them into strength.
You're just like a woman!
No equal exchange!
Say the same thing!
Did you meet Dante?
I saw your love letter.
400 years ago.
You moved from one body to another,
extending your life.
Isn't that right?
Why did you marry a mother?
Did you want to have fun by having children with an ordinary woman?
Because I loved her.
I loved your mother, Trisha.
I fell in love for the first time.
You're lying!
Then why?
Because my body is falling apart.
Eat it.
Eat it.
It will become a perfect stone inside you.
Come on, eat it faster!
What happened here?
What's wrong with you?
Come on, eat it quickly!
I want to see it!
I want to see you eat his child!
Quickly!
Bastard!
I wanted to shake my soul out of the baby!
Fear!
Fear!
Fear!
I'm sorry.
It was so unexpected.
A fire?
Careful.
There's nothing in the baby except hunger.
He's a homunculus,
which was originally created with the help of red water.
He doesn't need a mind.
Dante, don't be afraid.
I'm going to save you.
I'm going to save you.
I'm going to save you.
I'm going to save you.
I'm going to save you.
I'm going to save you.
I'm going to save you.
It's not impossible to create Voilà,
it takes pride in itself.
That's why I've been hiding all this time.
But when I learned that she found you…
So Dante,
did she send you through this way to the Fu Draw?
I assume, Dante believes that she has led the charge
between my body, mind and soul,
and that I'm wandering around inside the Draw…
But I could not pass through there.
That body…
The only difference in this world is that alchemy was not developed here.
However, in everything else, it is the same as ours.
Therefore, there was a child here, the same as you.
Probably somewhere here there is a child, the same as Al.
So what? You lived next to this child?
Your body is still inside these gates.
Only the soul and the mind were able to move into the body of this Edward.
The Minister wants to see you.
Wait!
Open the gates inside yourself and find your body in the gates.
Will you come back?
I can't come back.
My body has already completely passed through the gates.
I can't use alchemy in this world.
However, you can still make it.
Do something!
I will die here.
In this body.
With this face and appearance that Trisha fell in love with.
Knowing that equal exchange is not true, I sighed with relief.
No equal payment is necessary when parents give love to their children.
There can be no value or reward.
Let it be so.
But if I make an effort, I will not be able to do it.
But if I make an effort, will I get something in return?
Will all efforts be rewarded?
Is it the same whether people pay for happiness?
I want to believe in equal exchange.
Reality.
Reality is not like that.
But if you call it children's fairy tales, then let me be a child.
I don't want to believe that by paying a price you don't get anything.
The ship is falling.
What?
Brigadier General Mustang?
He must be at the northern front now.
There is a double there.
Mustang is in the central.
He is preparing an attempt on the Fuhrer.
This is probably the mouse.
The house is old.
Just in case, I'll go and check.
I'm entrusting you with my family.
As you wish.
And go to the headquarters as soon as possible.
My family is the most precious thing.
I thought you would come alone.
Tell me, this is the first time you betray me.
You were the first to betray me.
I'm betraying you because I'm a homo.
I'm a homo.
I'm a homo.
I'm a homo.
I'm a homo.
I'm a homo.
I'm a homo.
I'm betraying you because I'm a homo.
You know, I don't care if you are human or not.
Then what are you talking about?
Since I became a Fuhrer, during numerous wars,
we have destroyed other states,
continuing to expand our territories.
And all this is just to create a philosophical stone.
People who have fallen into despair from the war
begin to look for a philosophical stone.
Stupid people.
So you are entrusting fools to create a philosophical stone?
Then, having taken it,
we save you from self-destruction.
In other words, we are the messengers of God.
There is no God.
Perhaps.
But then there are devils.
And it's you, alchemists.
Don't you like it?
The shock wave in a closed volume
does not go into any comparison with what is on the surface.
I already guessed, dear fiery alchemist.
I saw air flows and noticed that this sector is closed.
Hello?
Hello.
I'm so sorry.
You were planning to attackcontacts.
I'm sorry, Mr. Alchemist.
If you look at my homemade
You'll be mine soon.
Jealousy!
Don't let him use alchemy!
You're an idiot!
My mom! My mom!
Resurrect me!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Bad boy!
Now the Philosopher's Stone is activated at full power.
If he decides to use alchemy, the transmutation will begin on its own.
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
But as long as he lives, he can be useful.
The gates!
The gates!
They don't disappear!
Ed!
Oh!
Ah!
I'm back!
That's it!
I'm dead!
I used my life on that side again!
Great, Edward!
Dr. Marco!
Why are you here?
You should know, Ed!
You're not the one who gave Dr. Marco to the Fuhrer, are you?
He's been in the stomach for a long time.
He just couldn't stay alive.
You killed him.
And I did, too.
It's hard to fight someone you know.
Even if you know that he's a completely different person.
Here's all your strength.
And then I'll beat you up.
I've already split up with several homunculi.
Even with the one my mom had.
So I don't care how you look.
That's right.
Try to kill me.
Well, it's not that easy.
Stop right there, Edward.
You're going to order me around.
I don't care.
What's going to happen to your brother?
The Philosopher's Stone is activated.
If there's a transmutation nearby, anything can happen.
What? Got it?
Enough of this shit!
It won't work.
It won't work.
I'm much stronger.
Bastard!
Stop!
Stop playing with me!
Edward!
Edward!
What else?
You decided to kill me?
That's what you get for having fun.
Show me your true face.
You're taking over the Cheshire.
You can't do anything else.
You want to see me?
If you can, show me!
Come on!
What's the matter?
You wanted to see it, didn't you?
Dad?
Dad?
Jealousy was the first homunculus
Goggenheim created when he was young.
Back then, he and I had a child
who died of mercury poisoning.
He tried to revive it,
but it failed.
And then he abandoned me.
Do you understand why I hate him?
Yes.
Edward!
