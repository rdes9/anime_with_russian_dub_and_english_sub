Episode Three
The soldiers snuck to the city
while the heretics fled
and some muddled stick began common sense.
They attempted to lure you
and attacked civil servants,
and it began because of you.
The Huey Raれe residents
are very close to the Eshvars.
The central people probably did not consider them
to be the same people as they are themselves.
It can not be!
I will complete the Philosopher's Stone
for the sake of the people who suffer under their oppression.
Wait! Wait!
It is much more perfect than what Taker does.
What is it, the inheritance of the fifth laboratory?
Hmm.
Major, how do you understand this?
Were you and Colonel Archer aware of all this?
What are you talking about?
I'm not talking about you.
I'm talking about Taker.
I'm talking about Taker.
I'm talking about Taker.
I'm talking about Taker.
I'm talking about Taker.
Were you and Colonel Archer aware of all this?
What are you really hiding?
Maybe that's enough?
Please!
Al!
Stop!
Major Armstrong has nothing to do with this.
I was the one who hid the mortel.
Alfons, are you serious?
I understand something.
I can not say it yet, but please,
do not argue anymore!
Do not argue!
Major,
I know that you fulfill the will of Hughes.
I have to go up without knowing anything,
and the shadow side will deal without me.
Yes.
Isn't it?
I'm sorry, but now I can not do anything.
Al!
Martell!
Listen!
Give this to him!
Take him inside!
Al!
Listen!
Martell, what's the matter?
They want to do the same thing with Lior and Ishvar.
What does it mean?
Fuhrer!
Come on, call!
Come on!
Come on!
The military are looking for a reason to attack.
In the end, it will turn out that Lior was the first to attack them.
Therefore, they had nothing left to do but to destroy us.
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
The warehouse is closed.
Let civilians take over the town without resistance
and the wrath of God falls on them.
Calling is not my great passion.
Roza has returned our deciding factor.
She said that neither the god of summer, nor the military will help.
Only we ourselves, with our own strength, will be able to go further.
But now you're following someone again.
Repeat the mistake.
What?
What to do?
We humans are weak.
Laila, is that perfume?
Yes.
I didn't have time to take a bath.
I hate this smell.
What are you going to do now?
Isn't it clear?
Do you think I can just watch like that?
What will make a scar?
Well, if you leave everything as it is,
then there will be victims among the inhabitants.
One thing to say is that they will use you.
But in the case of failure ...
I thought you were just looking at the scar in your mouth.
We were united by the desire to protect the city.
Laila, I have a request for you.
Listen to her, please.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Oh, that's great!
This is Alfons.
He's from leor,
brought me a letter address me
from your brother?
So he's fine?
Yes.
Judging by Ed's letter,
the scar is all aenges in the public,
He wants to lure the military and use them as the raw material for the Philosopher's Stone.
What are you talking about?
The raw material for the Philosopher's Stone is living people.
And they need a lot of it.
Is that possible?
So it's true about the fifth laboratory.
So they were conducting experiments on people?
Al, go to Lior. If you are there, you will surely meet Ed.
Okay, but...
If we don't interfere, Lior will give up soon.
And we will have time to arrest Shram and then...
I see.
Al, this is for Ed.
The major asked me to return it.
To be continued...
Help!
Those who oppose the army will die.
Help!
Talking animals?
What kind of heresy is that?
Chimeras.
So they are...
And also a man who, as soon as he touches something, the explosion rumbles.
What?
What happened?
It's just a demonstration of power.
After them, the main troops will attack.
According to our plan, without resisting, we will let them into Lior.
But first, you will leave the city through that very tunnel.
In the meantime, I will destroy those enemies who have already penetrated here.
And you will help people run away from the enemy.
So that's it.
Let's go, Rosa, Laila.
It's easy for you to refuse.
If my letter reaches, the army will not come.
And if there is no raw material for Shram to create a philosophical stone,
nothing will happen.
I can help you run where the military will not reach you.
And Lior will be under the control of the military.
You can hate me, but I will not oppose the plans of the military.
Please have a look.
All our forces have gathered here.
Seven thousand soldiers.
Now we can crush Lior at any moment.
No, wait.
We will postpone the attack.
Postpone?
Judging by the letter that Colonel Mustang received, the steel alchemist is alive.
Perhaps Lior is ready to join us in dialogue.
Now it is impossible.
However, we cannot attack the city without a serious reason.
Pride.
And why did you postpone the attack?
Something is not satisfied with passion.
Shram is waiting for the attack of the military.
He plans to use their lives to transmute the philosophical stone.
Come on, send the troops immediately.
I have an order from that man.
I do not know what is on the mind of that man, but his word is the law.
Passion.
But no, if Shram is going to create a philosophical stone, I will help him.
Do you have any personal feelings for Shram?
We exist thanks to that man, do not forget about it.
That is why I was looking for the philosophical stone.
I'm going to Lior again.
Move the troops as quickly as possible.
The siege.
But that man ...
You can only run away.
And the guards in whom the skin of the same color, which you also had, were a little stronger.
It turns out that we were wrong in the calculations.
I thought that from this they would quickly get angry.
It turns out that they killed not enough.
So it's you.
Bagrov and the alchemist.
Who are you?
Ah, I remember.
Is this Shram one of my masterpieces?
Where did you get your hand?
You will be the last state alchemist I will kill.
Damn it!
His right hand.
I see.
The same as then.
The red stone.
He may have eaten the stone.
The red stone.
The red stone.
He can eat this damn red light as much as he wants.
I will create a philosophical stone inside of me.
Why should we leave the city?
Let's fight.
No.
The Holy Mother wishes so.
If we run away and Shram does not return, what will we do?
Without a philosophical stone we will not be able to fight.
Enough, Layla.
I have a relationship with the army.
I will do something.
I can not trust you.
We will have to run in different directions.
And after that we will tell in different cities what happened in Leor.
What happened in Ishvar before.
About the atrocities of the army.
About everything.
There will be more rumors.
That is, another city that tried to create a philosophical stone fell.
Rosalaiätzlichy?
Run away from here, fast!
I waited for...
... my motivation.
This is you, the teacher.
You have a wrong attention to hotel.
You do not see the truth.
Rain has fallen...
Anger!
Call me Anger!
Rosa! Stupid! Don't come near!
Anger!
Shut up!
Shut up!
That's it!
Rosa, run!
Shram just used you!
You have no reason to die!
Run!
I know your weak spot.
I was told about it by greed.
You can't move if you touch the bones or the ashes of those who tried to revive you when you were created.
You are only fakes.
That's why when the original is nearby, you are just a chain of fear.
So I don't have a weak spot.
Because my own body was used as a transmutation material before it was born.
My real body is nowhere to be found.
And if it exists, then it's your body!
What is it?
Go to the others!
Well, that's enough.
You are chasing me, and the army is probably already coming.
I want to take revenge for my brother.
That's stupid. You fight only for revenge.
And what are you fighting for?
Just like that.
Just like that?
Just like that you are destroying the Ishvar people!
So what?
It's worth a little to remake a man as he becomes a bomb.
Man is not such an important thing.
And you and I are just moving bodies.
Just empty.
Maybe I'm an empty.
But I'm alive.
I told you, Alphonse Elric.
I, like your brother, am a state alchemist.
You are an ordinary killer.
Mr. Schramm, wait. Where is my brother?
Go away, Alphonse Elric.
Stop it.
Enough killing.
Maybe it's time to put an end to this, Mr. Schramm.
It worked!
I transmuted your hand very well.
You hear?
One second before your death.
Your hand is gradually entering a chemical reaction with oxygen from the atmosphere.
And finally...
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Look carefully.
Am I an empty?
Or not?
I'm a living man!
Mr. Schramm!
Go to your brother.
I'll do what you can't.
Why was the red stone in the silver watch?
I promised that I would blow you up.
Alphonse!
What a wonderful feeling!
An excellent bomb will come out of you!
Are you the secretary of the Führer?
Edward?
Why didn't you create me properly?
Edward!
Give me back my body!
Give it back!
Shut up!
Enough!
Shut him up!
Shut up!
Shut up!
Get up!
And go!
Shut up!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
