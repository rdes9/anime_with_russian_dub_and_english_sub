Well?
Did you find anything valuable?
No, it's very, very...
You won't find it until you get to the bottom of it.
Huh?
Huh?
Thank you very much.
However, don't you mind?
We are...
We know everything about you by your skin and eyes.
You are Schwartz, aren't you?
People gathered here who, for one reason or another, could not remain in their native places.
We have here small criminals and military people who got into bribes.
It's even funny.
Here, please, drink.
And Schwartz with a scar on his face!
I heard about him!
Wait!
Hey, wait!
Stop it!
I'm sorry I yelled at you!
Did he fall off the wall or what?
Hey, you!
Damn it!
Damn it!
And just when I was in a hurry...
Well?
I heard that you are a state alchemist and are interested in the issues of human transmutation.
When a person wants to get something, he needs to sacrifice something.
So, if you want to get something, you have to give something equal in return.
In alchemy, this is called the law of equal exchange.
At that time, we believed that this is the truth that rules the world.
I'm sorry I yelled at you!
Damn it!
Damn it!
Damn it!
I'm sorry I yelled at you!
Damn it!

My god!
How would I know what they were up to?
The chicken breasts are under $150.
Besides, the alu sedum is not so sweet.
The beef shoulder is under $200.
We are here during the execution.
I do not advise you to hide anything.
The pork mince is under $98.
Give it to me.

That's how friendship is born.
Wow!
So, tell me, where are they, girl?
There are rumors about the use of the brother in experiments and attaching his soul to the object.
And also that the Gaomon is hunting for you.
I can take you to a safe place, you and your younger brother, monster.
What about the younger brother?
He is really empty, as Tucker said.
Tucker? What are you?
Oh, mister, you know what, people are talking.
You will not go away!
Cool! Cool!
I'm cool too!
What was that?
Chimera, did you really run away from the fifth lab?
Major, we haven't seen each other for a long time.
This is Lieutenant Colonel Archer. He heads the military court.
What do you need in this haze?
Military court? Just like Lieutenant Colonel Hughes.
How is the Lieutenant Colonel doing?
I would like to ask you about this Chimera and much more.
Excuse me, now is a bad time.
Let's go.
It's getting more and more interesting.
Perfect Chimera, then.
Let's catch her.
Let's go.
It's not easy for you.
Why are my hands different from yours?
She is not real.
What happened to your real one?
Where is she?
Don't you remember where this scar came from?
I don't know.
Maybe it's just a coincidence.
It can't be.
But your hand and your leg were taken away at the same time.
Why are they here now?
It's strange.
Yes, it's strange.
However, if he could bring my hand and leg from that side to the gate,
maybe your body too?
Look at his right leg.
We are approaching the mystery of the fifth laboratory.
Arrest him.
What about the brothers?
We got a bigger prey.
Do it.
Hey, listen.
Did I do something wrong?
What are you doing, Major?
Ed, no!
Major, this child doesn't remember anything.
We have already informed the police.
He is an important witness in the case of destruction in the headquarters.
We will deal with him in the southern headquarters.
What are you talking about?
Didn't you have to see this sign before?
Is this boy one of the homunculi?
He is connected to those who destroyed the fifth laboratory.
Major!
Edward Elric, we intend to receive evidence from you again.
Stay in your teacher's house.
Didn't the Fuhrer forbid further investigations into the case of the fifth laboratory?
Didn't the Fuhrer forbid further investigations into the case of the fifth laboratory?
Once I was bitten by a fox right here.
He has the same scar on his shoulder.
And his leg doesn't look like it belonged to him.
Do you want to say that he has your hand and leg?
It's ridiculous.
I don't know. That's why I want to check.
Leave it.
It's impossible.
My brother and I have been doing this for the sake of it.
If we investigate it, though I don't know how it can be investigated,
if we understand that the hand and leg of this child belong to your brother,
what then?
Will you take them away from yourself?
Don't talk nonsense.
Then don't interfere.
Understood?
Yoki?
Yoki, where did I hear that name?
He claims that he used to be in charge of the mines in the east.
Ah, I remember.
No, it's true, it's true.
Yes, yes, that's right.
Great. If it's true, I'll let the Fuhrer know himself.
And you'll be able to return to the army.
Hurray!
And after all this, he was taken to the southern headquarters.
Good. Well done that you found him.
And you can forget about your brothers for a while.
Look after him.
Understood?
The Elric brothers are exactly like you said.
Oh, yes. They will definitely come in handy to you.
They are driven by envy, pride and others too.
I thought it would be interesting to take them,
but it turns out that I can get something more interesting.
The same homunculus as me, but can use alchemy.
If you don't lure him in your direction, then it will be difficult.
Let me go there.
Idiot, this is not the place where you can easily break into.
You are former soldiers, you should understand.
You know, I used to serve in the southern headquarters.
You'd better shut up, you state alchemist.
Well, then you can at least take these two there.
But I warn you, if you betray us ...
Listen, do whatever you want.
I just want to see the fireworks.
What did you do to him?
We didn't do anything.
And you, teacher, why are you so worried about him?
The military will probably find out who he is.
Besides, he ...
He is not a human.
Maybe you won't believe me,
but we had to meet him.
He is not a human.
You won't believe me,
but we had to meet the homunculi,
artificially created people.
Everyone had the power that people don't have.
The mouth that can eat any metal.
The fingers that pierce through everything.
The bodies that can transform.
He used alchemy,
but because he is a monster.
Do you know why the homunculi appear?
Izumi ...
Do you think I didn't notice?
What is he?
Teacher!
She has been sick for a long time.
Yes.
But she is so strong that we sometimes forget about it.
What's wrong with her?
Maybe she can be cured in the hospital?
Unfortunately, it is very difficult to do.
Why?
Sorry, of course, but it's much better there.
Such a disease.
It's not a disease.
It's not a disease.
She has no internal organs.
From here to here.
No?
As if cut out.
And the remaining organs are complexly connected
to preserve their functions.
It is not clear how she remains alive.
Ed, but this is ...
As if it is a disease.
It's not a disease.
It's not a disease.
It's a disease.
After all, this is ...
As if she took them.
So the teacher did the same as we did.
Doctor!
Thank you, dear.
Do not worry.
I'll go alone.
Last time I did not help.
Therefore ...
Please.
I do not want you to see what I want to do.
Zik!
Izumi is there now, right?
Why do not you say anything?
Izumi, Ed, Al.
Why?
I did not know anything.
Tana, I'm sorry.
She said, forgive me.
To save her life, I made a decision
not to give birth.
And despite this,
she asked me for forgiveness so many times
that she could not give birth.
Child, that means what?
But I did not know anything.
About her grief.
How much she thought about it
to do such a thing alone.
Such a thing?
The same thing that Ed and Al did.
Human transfusion!
She wanted to revive the baby!
She did it all alone.
I do not know what she saw there.
However, when she returned,
she had nothing left in her stomach.
She said that she could not have children anymore
and again asked for forgiveness.
Your exit, Mr. Saper.
A little gray is not enough.
What is this explosion?
Major, grab this woman.
Major?
What is it?
Why are you so noisy here?
Teacher, let this child go
and run away from here.
Teacher, I am an army dog!
Why is the teacher here?
And the lizard is here.
Sorry, but we also need this child.
Teacher, major, and these guys.
Damn! Four sides!
No, rather five.
This man...
He is not Ishvar.
Do not get close to him.
Did you notice the tattoos on his face?
He is a sinner.
He went against the divine teaching
and was forever expelled from Ishvar.
Is there a group of Ishvars in the south of Kishu?
Supposedly, there is a scar among them.
Do you understand?
Yes, sir.
We are moving out.
There is a scar in the slums in the west of the southern city of Kishu.
It's good if he gives up.
We will deal with all the inhabitants of the slums.

Give it back. It belongs to my brother.
We have come to return it.
