        <pre>This is Schwartz. I wonder what they're doing here.
Take off your military clothes.
Apparently, they're being transported.
It's going to take a lot of time.
They say the flow of water is weak.
What's going on there?
Thanks to this, the train's departure will be delayed a little.
Yes, we're lucky.
The train's departure will be delayed a little.
Thanks to this, the train's departure will be delayed a little.
Thanks to this, the train's departure will be delayed a little.
Yes, we're lucky.
Now we don't have to go to the southern camp.
Well, guys, what have you done?
We haven't done anything!
What if your troops show up and all of us are tied up?
How bad is it?
For Schwartz, reservations are given.
If you leave them in groups, you become an excellent target.
By the way, Schramm said that once upon a time a philosophical stone was made in Schwartz.
We're looking for a person who would know the details.
You're friends with Schramm, aren't you?
Why would we be friends with such a guy?
We have nothing to say to the military.
We don't know anything.
But the old man living on the outskirts of Kishua probably knows something.
The teacher?
This couple will be able to take you there.
Are we going to such a place?
Why not?
Are you asking us to take at least children out of here?
Ed, we need to give something in exchange for information.
Equal exchange.
We don't have it in our training, but we need it.
The teacher?
As a bonus, I'll arrange a shower for you.
Take people out, or they'll crash there.
Run!
Sorry.
Hey, what are you doing there?
Get in!
Winry, you stole it! You can't do that!
Don't be a fool!
I was told that if I fix it, I can take it.
Is that you?
Full speed ahead!
No!
When a person wants to get something, he needs to sacrifice something.
So, if you want to get something, you have to give something equal in exchange.
In alchemy, this is called the law of equal exchange.
At that time, we believed that this is the truth that rules the world.
The law of equal exchange.

The law of equal exchange mighty true- 부분
And now
Kishua, this is a little more western, right?
Okay, okay
We're lucky, aren't we, Ed?
Winry, how much more are you going to talk to us?
Who is so small there?
Who is small here?
Okay, you have to go home
If I'm not there, who's going to fix your car?
It's hard for me, too
The anger, the hand and the leg of Ed
I was ready to tear them off to get my brother back
But in the eyes of Winry, I can't do that
You wouldn't have been able to do it before
Yes, Al is not capable of it
But I can do it for our sake
Ed
Once upon a time, I didn't believe that people easily kill each other
However, in a hopeless situation, I killed Al, the alchemist of Majihal
It was an accident, you tried to save him
In the fifth lab, I was going to kill many prisoners
I thought that compared to the return of Al and his body, their lives were nothing
But you couldn't do it
And then Sharam
If he gets in my way again, I will kill him
You will kill him?
You will kill him?
But he is...
You have to kill such traitors
In any case, there are many dangers ahead
You will be in the way if you keep talking
Winry
I'm in the way
It looks like a war
You've never seen a war
I have
We have
These people are the same
As on the day my mom died
The military surrounded the city
But we didn't do anything
And despite that
Why?
Mom! Mom! Mom!
Rick, enough!
Enough already!
Are you okay?
What's going on?
I don't want to go
This place is cursed
And you, Winry?
Yeah
Sorry for the intrusion
Ed?
Ed?
The same thing that happened on the right hand side
I don't understand
Ed?
The same thing that happened on the right hand side
And underground in the fifth lab
Both of you, get out
Why are you shooting?
I knew you would turn away
If you knew it was us, why did you shoot?
It's because of the blue Feldfebel Fury
It's okay, let's wait for them here
Where's the colonel?
He's in the headquarters with the warrant officer Farman
So he quickly got rid of the boat after his spectacular performance
Did you attack the train because you were against the colonel's actions against the Ischvars?
No, but now the Ischvars are not trying to start a war
Why suppress them by force?
You shouldn't be mistaken
This time there were no casualties among the Ischvars
One former military man died
You know him, his name was Yoki
Yoki?
Did he die?
There was a shot from the Ischvars, they got Yoki
The situation got worse
Come on!
The colonel had to demonstrate his strength to pacify the Ischvars
If he didn't do that, there would have been more casualties
What a noble gesture for a military man
What do you have against the military? You serve in the army
It was decided to move everyone to the southern camp
But we have to find and punish the one who made the first shot
That's why several people are left here
There's an old man among them, isn't there?
The one who lived in this hut
How serious is it? Is he arrested?
No, this old man is not a suspect, we're just protecting him
Protecting?
These are the Ischvars
They attacked him, calling him a heretic and a heretic
It seems that he is no longer his
What nonsense!
The Ischvars themselves have always suffered from discrimination
It turns out that among them...
A heretic? What kind of people are they?
They are not pure
They are against the Ischvar teaching
They have tattoos on their faces, it's a sign of a heretic
What exactly are they doing against the teaching?
Well, mom said...
Yes, she said, believe in the Ischvar god
And if you don't, you'll become a heretic
But the fact that this man is a heretic too
This man?
The man you call a heretic
He is a heretic
A traitor
What was your mom like?
Well, she was so kind
She had sick eyes
And she worked in the hospital for others
In the hospital?
In the hospital?
Philosopher's Stone
This is the third time I've been asked about it
The third time?
The young man with the scar
And once upon a time the elder brother of this young man
The scar and his elder brother
And what, the elder brother of the scar was able to make the first Philosopher's Stone?
No, he couldn't do it
The young man was too kind
And why do you know about the Philosopher's Stone?
You're an Ischvara
I'm an Isgoi, I practiced the Great Teaching
The Great Teaching?
Once upon a time there was a secret knowledge in the Ischvara
Called the Great Teaching
Thanks to which we flourished
But once this teaching was forbidden
And it was put on taboo
Those who were connected with the teaching became Isgois
Who were forbidden to return to their homeland
The Great Teaching allowed to freely transform the forms of all things
So it was decided that it would contradict the will of God
It turns out that the Great Teaching is alchemy
Fool, this can't be
Do you think that since there are no modern technologies in the Ischvara
If we live in the desert, then we can't be alchemy
Do you really think so?
There's nothing to be ashamed of
Many believe that if people have different skin colors and eyes
Then there can be nothing in common between them
And you won't tell us about the way to make the Philosopher's Stone?
I believe that in your theories and our ancient teachings
There are no special differences
The only question is how many human bridges are needed
What bridges?
When a city or country dies
Dozens or hundreds of thousands of people suffer and die
Their hatred remains, their blood
And...
And when a master who is skilled in this teaching takes them into his body
The Philosopher's Stone is born
This is an even more cruel version of the way we know
We don't want to know this
And what did Mr. Schramm say?
He said that he would create the Philosopher's Stone
Why did you say that to my brother?
He just wanted to bring his beloved back to life
And that's why Ishvar fell
And many lives became human bridges
Brother judged himself
He decided that he was the one who caused the fall of Ishvars
He's here!
It's impossible! There are many of them!
It's repeating itself again
Will the people of Ishvar finally be able to find peace?
If I can get his power from the Philosopher's Stone
Will you become an Ishvara?
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
Will you become an Ishvara?
I've been an Ishvara since the very beginning
There are many tens of thousands of lives in this hand
And a scorned Ishvara...
Rick!
You can sleep suffering from pain
You can't sleep causing pain
So I won't sleep anymore
Get out of here! Get out of here!
Are you sure she said Rockbell?
I'm sure
There was a very angry doctor there
But she gave us candies
She treated all the wounded, even Ishvars
And despite that, she was killed
It's a pity
Did you say that the state alchemist killed her?
I heard that it was an alchemist who used a flame
He was rewarded for it
Our mother even cried then
Winry!
Did you see any traces of the wound, Harry?
Yes
There should be more holes in the exit hole
But there isn't
Ed!
It's...
There's Lieutenant Colonel Archer in the headquarters
He's hunting homunculi
Homunculi?
There's a monster among them
It can quickly throw fingers out like thin spikes
It's the same thickness
I think Archer and Major Armstrong know about him
So it's not Ishvars
In that case, we can't help but listen to the words of the state alchemist
Hey, you!
Winry!
Rick, Leo
Now no one will touch you here
Besides, all the investigation will be stopped
But Ishvars will be sent to the camp again
If you want, you could live in Resenburg
No, we'll go to the camp too
I see
Where are you going?
We're going after Sharama
Something terrible could happen
Are you going to kill him?
Why?
Because he's an alchemist
He's not pure
That's why
We want to stop him
Because we're the same alchemists
The same people
We don't want to kill anyone
And we don't want him to kill anyone
That's not true
You hate Ishvars
It's scary
Not at all
No?
And I'm a little scared to look into your red eyes
And when I first met Sharama
He was the first Ishvars I saw
And I was even more scared
But I don't want to see him
I don't want to see him
I don't want to see him
I don't want to see him
I don't want to see him
I don't want to see him
I don't want to see him
It was more scary
But our feelings can deem us
It's not necessary that your parents
advised you the right thing
That's why
We only have to find an answer
OMG
It- it won't take long
Boy went dark
I don't want to go there
I'm going to the Central. What? How can I go with you?
I haven't seen Yuzo and Alice for a long time.
All right.
Winry, something happened.
Well, let's start with the Eshwar.
It would be good if Mr. Shram didn't make a philosophical stone yet.
Yes, it's a strange thing.
Who would have thought that I wouldn't want this?
What is this?
Mr. Lieutenant.
It's Lisa.
Lisa, did you have to shoot people?
I had to. And a lot.
Did you know about the Rokbelov doctors?
Yes.
I don't know what you know, but the military sometimes has to deprive people of their lives
by following a meaningless order.
Perhaps that's why I don't like the army very much.
But you serve in the army.
There is a man in the army that I defend.
No one forced me to do so.
I want it that way.
And I will do what I want to do to save him.
Until he reaches his goal, I will do what I want to do.
What if he doesn't deserve to be protected?
I have to decide that, too.
This is the child, Gnev the Seventh.
Gnev?
Nice to meet you, Gnev.
I want you to follow my other brothers again.
Didn't you say that you didn't want them to create a philosophical stone?
But they are going to Ishvar.
If they find out the truth about what happened there,
they will no longer want to create a philosophical stone.
Now it will be difficult for us to do anything.
We can eat them.
Yes, depending on the situation,
we may have to destroy them.
I'm sorry, I didn't know anything.
I will push him to the top.
These were his words.
He said he would turn Mustang into a Fuhrer.
How could that be?
Could he help at least a little in this?
This...
This...
This is the only thing I can do for you, Gnev the Seventh.
I'm sorry, I didn't know what to do.
I'm sorry, I didn't know what to do for you, Gnev the Seventh.
I'm sorry, I didn't know what to do for you, Gnev the Seventh.
I'm sorry, I didn't know what to do for you, Gnev the Seventh.
I'm sorry, I didn't know what to do for you, Gnev the Seventh.
I'm sorry, I didn't know what to do for you, Gnev the Seventh.
It's like we'll meet again in this town tomorrow.
To believe in love is to never give up on yourself.
Until the day my dream comes true,
I'll look at the stars with a smile and offer my prayers.
Because I'm here,
I want to be in the sky for you.
Even sadness is wrapped around me.
Whenever I look up, I see that I'm not alone.
So that I can feel that I'm far away.
So that I have a place to return to.
