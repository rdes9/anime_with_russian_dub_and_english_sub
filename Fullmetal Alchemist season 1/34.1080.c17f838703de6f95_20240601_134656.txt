I'm sorry, but this is an order from Lieutenant Colonel Archer.
Stop fooling around. I'm in a hurry.
I'm sorry, but this is an order from Lieutenant Colonel Archer.

Welcome, Bohrova Alchemist Zolov J. Kimble, and Alchemist in Schottaper.
Welcome, Bohrova Alchemist Zolov J. Kimble, and Alchemist in Schottaper.
Welcome, Bohrova Alchemist Zolov J. Kimble, and Alchemist in Schottaper.
I've fulfilled my promise. And you?
I understand that you have nothing to fear. I guarantee your safety.
I guarantee your safety. I'm Frank Archer. I'll take care of it.
And what about safety?
Exactly.
You will return to the army and continue your research as my direct subordinate.
Can I really continue my research?
Yes.
Change of orders.
Do not spare anyone who is resistant.
Eliminate everyone you find.
But is it possible?
We do not need them.
Since Takir is on our side, such creatures can be made as many as they want.
And since I have this, greed will not be able to shake my hand.
When a person wants to get something, he needs to sacrifice something.
Thus, if you want to get something, you must replace it with something unequal.
In alchemy, this is called the law of equal exchange.
At that time, we believed that this was the truth that ruled the world.
The End
Damn it!
Greed is here!
I'm coming.
What is it?
It's me, Alex Louis Armstrong.
People call me an alchemist with a strong hand.
Major!
Give us Alphonse Eureka.
How dejecting a laziness to use people.
But it's because of her that the alchemists ran away.
What else can I do?
Now it's your turn, greed.
Alphonse Eureka
Did you see that?
This is an example of the true art of alchemy that the Armstrong family owns.
It seems that in order to defeat you, you need something else.
Well, let's get serious now.
Interesting thing.
I haven't fought like this in a long time.
Alphonse Eureka
You are in your repertoire.
And you are in your Armstrong.
My muscles are the same as before.
I used to fight there too.
During the Ishvarsk War, I was a private.
A former comrade.
Then I don't see a reason to kill you.
Give up.
Impossible.
Major, step back.
Major, don't get in yet.
Yes, I will.
Tell Kimble and Tucker.
They will pay for it.
How did they suddenly quiet down?
Was there a noise at first?
Probably tired of the scandal.
Thank you at least for that.
Right.
As a result, only we were able to run.
So, what to do next?
And how much more do you intend to run?
However, it's too late to think about it.
Who are you?
I suppose you already know about the siege.
And I can imagine.
I am a new passion.
So you are...
I'm sorry to get straight to the point, greed.
But you have two ways.
Either you will be sealed again,
or you will die right here.
Can you do it?
You forgot.
You didn't make a mistake,
despite the fact that you were an ordinary homunculus.
And 140 years ago you were sealed.
Sir, are you angry?
Let's put an end to this, greed.
End? End?
Sorry, baby, we need help.
Forget about the mortel.
Lou, Dolchetta!
Hey, wait! What's going on there?
Get out of here, greed.
Give it to us.
Guys...
We can't lose you on this.
We order you to take revenge for everyone.
That's what kind of faithful pawns you keep.
I was connected to the dog,
and the dog has a strong sense of bondage.
You will not go any further.
Greed?
And there?
It's useless to run away.
Dolchetta, they say you can run away,
by pressing your tail.
I would like to,
but you will be sleeping later.
Are you ready?
It's too late to ask.
So, let's go to Domodonte.
What a good man you are.
If you were there,
you would have a chance to run away.
Why are you telling me this?
Okay. Hey, mortel.
Yes?
Stay inside until morning.
What?
If I don't come back by this time,
run alone.
Got it?
Run.
Greed?
What are you going to do?
Sorry, baby.
I'll leave you to it.
But...
Let me out.
I told you to open the door.
No.
Greed told me not to come out.
It doesn't matter. Open it.
It turns out that as a result,
I came back here.
I wonder why my legs
always lead me to this place.
Am I going to pray to him
for mercy?
Or...
Good boy, Greed.
Everything is unfolding
according to plan.
And we're done?
Yes.
Our job is done.
I'm hungry.
Oh, it's you.
You came here because
you were born here.
You...
It's...
It's...
It's...
Your bones.
Who are you?
What did Dante tell you?
Dante?
There.
What does it mean?
It can't be!
Such a little girl can't do it.
Then who is it?
It can't be!
But it's...
Life!
My life!
Damn!
I found you, Greed.
Dante!
Greed!
What have you done?
What have I done?
I don't understand.
You did it.
Answer me!
Think what you want.
I don't care.
But why?
Why are you trying
to save your brother?
Because Al,
my younger brother...
So you're ready.
Where's Al?
Give him back!
If you want him back,
what are you going to do?
Let him go!
Never!
What happened?
Is that all you've got?
Well?
You said
I was a mistake.
I told you
if you want to beat me...
You need to want to kill yourself.
Isn't that right?
That's right.
My mechanic is great.
No matter what,
his arm moves.
Hold on!
I'm not hot
or cold, baby.
Now it's my turn.
What have you done
to my shield?
It's easy to think.
It's impossible
to create something out of nothing.
In other words,
your shield
has to come from something.
You said that the substances
that make up the body of homunculi
are the same as humans.
In the human body
they are the same
as humans.
In the human body
there is a substance
that can be turned into something
that will increase the hardness
and strength of the body.
This is carbon,
which is a third of the human body.
Atoms of carbon change
the nature of their bonds,
forming a substance of different hardness
and becoming a pencil rod
or diamond.
It's easy to understand
the principle.
Tell me where Al is.
I haven't lost yet.
But the outcome is already clear.
Your brother
must have already told you.
I can't die.
Then I'll have to beat you
until you talk.
Not bad.
Otherwise, it would be
completely uninteresting.
It's good that I put
my trust in you.
Come here.
That's it.
It's a masterpiece!
Where is Al?
I've let him go for a long time.
Greed.
Greed.
Greed.
Greed.
Greed.
Greed.
Homunculus is born
when you, alchemists,
produce human transmutation.
We weaken
when we approach the remains
of a person you tried to revive.
This is the weak point
of all homunculus.
Why?
Why are you telling me this?
You can beat them.
I'm already tired
of being locked up.
Greed. You...
I'm greedy.
This is my life.
And I want to end...
Greed!
...the destroyed.
I hope
you...
I hope you
...mean less...
than me!
Greed.
Greed.
Greed.
Greed.
Greed.
Greed.
Greed.
Greed.
Greed.
Greed.
Greed.
Greed!
What's this?
What's this?
Martell!
Listen!
What did the teacher say?
When I came here, she was already...
I don't even know where Lila went.
Teacher, we're sorry for everything.
We're going to Ishvar.
We're going to Ishvar.
We're going to Ishvar.
We're going to Ishvar.
We're going to Ishvar.
We're going to Ishvar.
We're going to Ishvar.
Get out of here or I'll...
Go.
Let me go!
Let me go.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, oh, my God.
I'm going to the village.
See you.
Yes.
See you.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Ugoa, Gusha's reunion.
Where do we come from and where do we go?
Is that the question of a fool?
