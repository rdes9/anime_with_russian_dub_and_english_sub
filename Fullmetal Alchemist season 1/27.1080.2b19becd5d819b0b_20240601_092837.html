Teacher?
Why are you here?
Teacher?
So she is...
Our chemistry teacher.
And where is Al?
Here.
Oh, yes, sorry.
You were so kind to us.
You do not know where Al is.
Well, Alphonse, it's me.
Thank you, excuse me again.
What?
I wanted to hide after changing clothes.
I heard about you.
Bad students.
They dropped out of school and went down to work for the army.
When a person wants to get something,
he needs to sacrifice something.
So if you want to get something,
you have to give something equal in return.
In alchemy, this is called the law of equal exchange.
At that time, we believed that this was the truth that ruled the world.

She's so beautiful!
What are you talking about? You've met her before.
She took us to the school in Rezimburg.
What do you mean, in Rezimburg?
There were heavy rains back then.
Inorganic water is 26%
Inorganic water is 34%
Lipids are 19%
Proteins...
Proteins...
Maybe we should start with the components of human body structure?
What are you talking about?
It's a secret!
Winry, it's none of your business!
It's not fair!
You two always keep secrets from each other!
Bye!
Today we're having a dinner with Stu!
Okay!
Yeah, see you later!
What a genius!
The one who invented Stu!
Let it be with milk, it's so tasty!
What's wrong with you?
It's a great idea to add milk, vegetable soup!
Scientists need the same power of imagination!
We have to learn it!
After all, there are limits to self-study, Ed.
We can't do it with our own knowledge.
Yeah...
What is missing for human transmutation?
You'd better ask why this transmutation is forbidden.
Maybe it's because it's a dangerous thing
and no one has ever managed to do it.
Remember the story about how the country fell in one night?
And it's about the Philosopher's Stone in the Eastern Desert?
Yeah.
They were trying to create an ideal human
and a disaster happened to all the people.
It's just a fairy tale.
His handwriting...
If only we could figure it out...
But look...
It also says here that human transmutation is forbidden.
Listen, Al...
We've already decided to revive mom...
I hope the shore of the river won't collapse.
Hey, you two, wait!
We'll help you!
Bad news...
Hey, carry the bags to the ground!
Hey, what are you doing there? It's dangerous!
Ready!
It worked!
It worked!
Alchemical circle! Ed! Ed!
Hey!
It's dangerous here, step back!
It's about you!
Run faster from here!
Who's there?
Wow!
It's an alchemical circle!
So many of them in a second!
It's been standing here for a while.
Unbelievable! Who are you?
Just a housewife!
Doctor! Doctor!
You helped us so much!
You're the benefactor of Risenburg!
Excuse us!
Let us in!
Excuse us!
Aunt, please...
Who are you, auntie?
Excuse us!
Take us as your students!
Please!
Students?
We know a little about alchemy, dear.
We want to improve our skills, so...
No!
Why?
I don't take students.
I have a store and I need to go back to Doubles.
Please, take us as your students!
Take us as your students!
How tired are you?
And why do you need to study alchemy?
Well...
We...
want to be useful people.
And your parents' permission?
This...
These guys have no parents.
I'm looking after them now.
Well, that's a deal.
How kind of you.
For one month.
Give them to the exam period.
We'll see if there's any point.
And if they don't,
we'll give them to the exam period.
And if they don't,
we'll give them to the exam period.
And if they don't,
we'll give them to the exam period.
We'll see if there's any point in teaching them alchemy.
We'll see if these kids have any talent.
And if they don't,
we'll give them back to the exam period.
And if we pass the exam period...
Then we'll start studying.
We won't be back in a month.
Don't wait!
I knew it.
Study! Study!
Study! Study!
There must be a huge lab there.
And there must be a lot of books there.
Of course. And we can read them all.
Teacher, you did so well
in transmutation
and even without alchemic circle.
Teacher, are you a state alchemist?
Don't compare me to army dogs
who deprive people of their lives by order.

So, you didn't learn anything, did you?
Huh?
Chess?
Wait!
I won't!
What the hell is this?
This is Chess of the Eastern Lands.
Yes.
It's here.
Well, we had a good time last time.
By the way, in these weekends...
Don't worry, I'll do it myself.
Hello? I'm a little busy right now.
Well, everything is fixed.
Thank you.
Huh?
I'm listening.
Come on, come on, come on!
Please,
you have to turn me on as well.
You were a member of the Huses in the investigation department, weren't you?
Come in.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
and yet
Teacher!!
Manny, how the teacher?
Soon will give birth to children
How� I was.
That's the minstrel!
Setsumi, welcome back!
Notes!
That's that
Edward long not seen
Has so long grown
Well done
And even that Initially it's annoying
Who is that the gentleman in armor?
I'm the younger brother, Alphonse.
You've grown a lot, huh?
You're not eating?
Enough, eat.
Okay.
Al, you eat too, it's delicious.
I'm already full.
Alphonse
Yes, it was a difficult journey for you.
You can't get involved in dangerous enterprises.
It wasn't that bad at all.
We helped people.
By the way, we even helped nature.
You fool, can we call what we did help?
We just chatted there without doing anything.
Well, yes.
When a person is born, everyone blesses his appearance.
The mother risks her life, the whole family helps.
Right.
You guys got your life just like that.
And you should be proud of her.
By the way, do you have children, Mrs. Aizumi?
Alchemist...
By the way, you must have learned a lot since then.
Show us something, huh?
As much as you want, Alph.
I'm coming with you.
Aizumi?
That's it.
So you saw how life is born.
These children got a good experience.
Well, I'm starting.
Wow, you got better at it.
And now me.
Stop!
Teacher, welcome back.
Welcome back.
Teacher, my locomotive broke down.
Can you fix it?
Oh, it broke down.
Give me that.
Can you fix it with alchemy?
No.
You can't rely on alchemy in everything.
If you can fix it with your hands, you have to fix it with your hands.
Well, here it is.
It's ugly.
It's ugly.
Well, I'm sorry.
If you don't want it to be ugly after the repair,
be careful not to break it.
Thank you, teacher.
If it breaks, we'll come back.
That's why I say, don't break it.
Teacher! Teacher!
What is it, Manny?
There's Chico! Chico!
Chico!
Chico is up there.
I'll go get him.
Got him!
Chico!
Chico!
Teacher, did Chico break down?
No.
She's dead.
Teacher, fix Chico!
You can do anything, can't you?
I can't do that.
A living creature and a pet.
I'm not God.
Chico's life is over.
But...
But...
She just...
I can't bring Chico back to life.
But we can make a grave for her.
Any life comes to an end.
The flesh returns to the ground.
The grass grows over it and the flowers bloom.
The soul remains in the memories and continues to live in the hearts of others.
Everything in this world flows and moves in a circle.
And human life too.
I understand it so well myself.
But it's still hard to explain it to children.
Teacher...
Have you ever wanted to bring back to life the one who's already dead?
You're asking for the second time already.
I just asked her like that.
It hurts.
What kind of state is that?
The principle of the action of the alchemical circle is the circulation of force.
The circle is a ring of force, and if you draw a structural formula in it, you can use this force.
Knowing how the force moves, you can cope with different tasks.
The one who accepts it, understands it and does it will become an alchemist.
Everything in this world flows due to a huge flow.
The death of a person is also a part of the flow.
So don't even think about resurrecting anyone.
Al, your armor is empty inside, isn't it?
And this is your arm and foot, right?
How did you...
Did you think I wouldn't notice the weight of the throw or the difference in the sound of the steps of the right and left foot?
Idiots.
Teacher...
You didn't use the alchemical circle today.
So you saw it.
Yes.
What happened?
Tell me about everything.
