        <pre>Episode 7
Here we are.
Yes.
Ed, what happened?
You're still asking.
Now we'll have to listen to one of the colonel's long stories.
So the trip to Leor was also useless.
Are you going to keep spending the army's budget on your nonsense until you get tired of it?
You can't see anything here, Edward.
I'm here, I'm here!
Sorry, sorry, you can't see this piece of paper.
But as you said, we've already arrived, so you can't do anything.
Let's go, Al.
Al, Al!
Al!
I'm sorry.
What are you doing there?
What is this?
When a person wants to get something, he needs to sacrifice something.
So if you want to get something, you have to give something in return.
In alchemy, this is called the law of equal exchange.
At that time, we believed that this was the truth that ruled the world.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
THE END
What happened, Brad?
Watch out!
There, there!
What is this?
Supposedly a dog. A poisonous animal.
I didn't ask about that, Lieutenant Farman.
I'm sorry, Lieutenant Hawkeye.
I'm sorry. I picked it up in the morning.
Will you leave it to yourself?
I would like to, if I could, but as you know, young Lieutenant Hawkeye,
it is forbidden to keep animals in the barracks.
But that doesn't mean that you can keep it in the office.
It was shaking in the rain.
It was so pitiful. Maybe someone will take it to themselves?
I live in the dormitory.
Not at all. I hate dogs.
Well, then I'll take it to myself.
I love dogs.
I love dogs.
Thank you very much, young Lieutenant.
I heard fried dogs are delicious.
In the East, they are breed for food, especially red.
Let's look for another owner for him.
Okay.
I was joking.
I'm sorry to distract you.
Edward, Alphonse, you're back.
What is it?
Come on, let's go, Al.
Edward, your report.
I'm reading it directly to the colonel.
We have no knowledge, no conditions to keep it.
It's not so easy to pick up animals.
But it was shaking in the rain.
Can I keep it to myself?
No.
Give it back to me.
You're a fool.
Don't run. I feel sorry for the cat.
I know.
It seems that you have done a lot of interesting things.
Is it in Leor?
You yourself gave me information about the fake Philosopher's Stone.
But I did not order to overthrow the teacher.
But as a result, the eastern headquarters began to rule the city.
Are you from the very beginning of this project?
Yes.
Did you plan this from the very beginning?
I heard that the mansion of the large landowner Magwar was destroyed by Ksenatai.
And he himself disappeared without a trace.
Ksenatai, yes.
Where is it?
Give me a report about the red water.
In addition, a request came from the police of the tourist center of Okroi.
Is it true that Sirena turned out to be a beauty?
Do you want to say, colonel, that you already know everything we did?
Steel Alchemist, don't you think it's time to calm down?
That is, I must act only according to you.
We have our own goal.
Philosopher's Stone?
You spent three years, but could not find it.
I will definitely find it.
Colonel, do you know a man named Marco?
Five years ago, this doctor appeared in Ksenatai.
It seems he is an alchemist.
The poison of red water that no one could cure, he was able to cure with the help of some kind of alchemical operation.
I thought that at least the name of a person with such abilities should be known to the military.
I don't remember anything, but I'll check.
Colonel!
What an unexpected visit, Brigadier General.
From today we are taking this office under the temporary central headquarters.
Temporary central headquarters?
We will not make it difficult for you.
More fun, more fun!
Your Excellency!
At the moment, the Eastern Region is under the supervision of the staff of the headquarters under the leadership of his Excellency.
Look, these chains.
These are silver watches, a sign of a state alchemist.
It turns out that all state alchemists are here.
Look, look, Alice is already riding a three-wheeled bike.
All the time follows me.
Can you imagine?
You don't change, Major.
I still have a photo. Will you look?
Oh, don't.
After all, it was necessary to warn you that you would come.
So, I wanted to see the amazement at the Mustang's physiognomy.
Oh, and now I'm a lieutenant colonel.
Now I'm a lieutenant colonel.
I'm conducting an investigation in the military court.
Then it was probably better for you to stay in the headquarters.
There was no way out.
All the main cones ran away from the headquarters, so ...
What?
Nothing.
By the way, tell me, how is it there?
How is the Philosopher's Stone?
I think we are approaching it.
Now we are looking for a man named Dr. Marco.
And the colonel does not tell me anything about him.
Maybe he just doesn't know?
No, this guy must be hiding something.
Dr. Marco, you say?
Brigadier General.
Iron-blooded alchemist.
Marco!
Isn't that Marco the Deserter?
Six years ago, during the Civil War in the East,
many state alchemists were called there.
However, this Marco was deserting from the front,
and since then his location is unknown.
Deserter?
I do not know.
Dr. Marco. Dr. Marco.
What a shit!
Well, why are all the records erased here?
If so, even if I have to knock off the colonel,
I will make him talk.
Why knock off at once?
You're not...
No.
The rain is not over yet.
Hey, I forgot to say something important.
Well, what else?
The fact is that the attestation of alchemists this year
will not take place in the center, but here.
What?
The attestation for the license of a state alchemist?
As for the rule, then...
Wait, Major!
Colonel!
I would like to do something as a confirmation of the license.
Huh?
Yes.
Training battle?
Does this happen?
State alchemists conduct a training battle,
and this battle is counted as an attestation.
And what, did it express such a desire?
And as an opponent, he called the colonel.
If you really fight, it is not known who will be stronger.
Probably the colonel.
How to say, you can not underestimate the rest.
But if you take into account the activity of the colonel in the Civil War in the East, then...
So why did Edward decide to do this?
They say he put forward the condition
that if he wins, he will be allowed to keep a cat.
What cat?
But Colonel, you have not seen a dog yet.
Yes.
Yes.
Dog.
How great!
Really?
Of course.
The most faithful in the world.
Absolute commemoration of the order of the master.
They do not complain if they are rude to them, they do not require salaries.
Real slaves of people.
How great! I love the dog!
By the way, colonel, will you accept Edward's challenge?
It is impossible to fight against a child at full strength.
It's a pity that I can not demonstrate everything I can.
Very interesting. I allow a training battle.
But, but...
Use the entire area of ​​the training area.
In this case, you can not worry about damage.
After all, you do not want to say that you are not sure.
So fight with the rest of the alchemists.
I will calmly perform what I was ordered.
Until I reach the rank of the Fuhrer
and I will not hold the whole army in my hands.
I believe you should refrain from such straightforward statements.
But what is the purpose of your bold plans?
Stupid question.
If I become the Fuhrer...
I will make all women wear mini skirts!
Colonel, I will always be with you!
Ladies and gentlemen!
Welcome to the party of the Eastern Staff!
So...
To your attention!
A photo of my daughter, who turned three this year!
No, no, no, no, no, no!
So let's get down to business.
Today's event!
In the red corner, the fiery alchemist Roy Mustan!
In the blue corner, the steel alchemist Edward Aldrich!
Where is he?
Such a small one is not at all visible.
From the school games!
The salad is small, small! Enough!
Calm down, Ed!
Okay, today is an important day,
when I will hit the colonel in the face.
Now he will not say a word.
But brother, the colonel is our benefactor.
What?
He is threatening to reveal our secret.
They use us completely.
And what is your strategy?
I will clean his face!
I don't care about the attestation.
If I win, I want to get information about Dr. Mark.
And also the permission to keep the cat.
Get ready!
Fight!
Commando!
Too late!
So unexpected, bastard!
The soldier respects the speed.
Quickly attack the battlefield and quickly bring the fight to an end.
I flashed where there was nothing!
Ah, this is the first time you see the colonel's work.
The glove on his right hand is made of special flammable fabric.
With strong friction sparks appear.
It remains only to increase the concentration of oxygen in the air and ...
Excuse me!
So...
Such a little girl that you can't get to the target.
I'm not a little girl!
Call the anger, save the mess.
Do not give in to the provocation of the enemy.
A little overworked.
There!
Now you can not create a flame!
My power!
Ah!
Oh, it hurts!
Cleverness is a soldier's weapon.
Cleverness in battle is a great strategy, steel.
Come on!
You can not tell me.
Enough!
It was a great fight.
Your praise is a great honor for me.
Wait, the exit is not yet ...
Well, if you continue ...
Then it will be difficult to restore order.
What will you do?
They were ordered to fix everything together.
That's why I didn't want to get involved.
Colonel, why did you stop?
Huh?
The last explosion.
You would have time.
It was a few years ago, during the Civil War in Ushvara.
Then what happened?
It was a few years ago, during the Civil War in Ushvara.
Then in the east, the inhabitants of Ushvara fought the military?
I saw so much ...
terrible.
Dr. Marko, who ran from the battlefield, turned out to be more honest than the rest.
Dr. Marko, who ran from the battlefield turned out to be more honest than the rest.
I think so now.
That's why you didn't say anything.
However, it is possible that you should meet him.
With Marko.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
With Marko.
Is he alive?
Colonel, I haven't figured out the reason why you stopped before the last explosion.
Well, okay.
If there are no other candidates, I will take him.
Really?
Well ...
Look, he calmed down right away.
I'm a very strict trainer.
Here, here, the toilet is here.
Got it?
Got it, Hayate?
Hayate?
Hayate?
About the city of Leora, which is mentioned in the report of Ed,
do you know that a detachment of General Hakurov was sent there?
Hmm?
They say it's a terrible place to stay.
It is written that after the overthrow of the teacher, people there should wake up.
The teacher is alive and well.
It convinces the citizen to fight the military.
I don't know if this is the carnel who is super Ed.
Maybe send Ed there again?
He thinks he saved the city.
Let him keep thinking that way.
Someday he will find out everything himself.
Since we got information from Colonel about Marko,
we can't ask for more about it.
It contradicts the law of equal exchange.
Well, yes.
Sorry.
There's nothing else to do now.
Well, will you tell me?
It's not just an inspection.
The intelligence together with the Fuhrer escaped.
Only in the headquarters were killed five state alchemists and people associated with them.
East City.
East City.
East City.
East City.
Steel Alchemist.
Episode 14.
Right Hand of Destruction.
Even if all the state alchemists are enemies,
I won't let you kill my brother!
