Something strange. What's wrong with my body?
Oh, you bitch!
I'll explain. Bombs are my specialty.
How to stop the process? Ask someone else.
It's okay. There's still a lot of time.
I created a structure that slowly, slowly absorbed the bomb.
So now wait for the moment when you explode.
It's a lie. My body...
I don't listen.
Don't move, Alphonse Selric. I don't know what to do.
Don't move, Alphonse Selric. I don't know what's going on with your body.
Let me...
Better don't touch him.
A man with a scar.
Gamuncul.
Gamuncul.
Your hand can only be destroyed.
If he were here, he could fix everything by transmuting the body of the baby into another material.
He could also stop the explosion.
Transmute into another material?
Let's go.
You have a goal. To create philosophical stones.
Still, you're not her.
She would never say that.
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.

Shut up
Shut up
Shut up
De .. De .. Get up .. Go .. Forward!
Shut up .. De .. De ..
Ah!
Rose!
Go!
Let me go!
That's it!
You won't have any more alchemy with my help!
Shut up!
Stop, Edward.
Come to me.
No!
No!
I was not allowed to rest this morning.
You look too much like her.
But I decided not to think about the fact
that that day, my brother and I
created you.
Edward!
Edward!
Edward!
Edward!
Edward!
So you are...
our crime.
Homunculus.
You joined the army.
For what purpose?
Don't you dare!
Don't touch her!
Let's go, Rose.
It's not that simple.
Homunculus has more than one life.
You can't finish them.
Isn't it great, Rose?
The voice is back.
Really?
Really?
Thanks to your voice...
and his.
We have no connection with Kimgley
and your alchemists.
The Fuhrer seems to be following someone else's orders.
Do they really need so much time
just to find the body of the steel man?
Is he fighting the scar there?
Or is he having fun there again?
I can't wait!
I can't wait!
So this is your headquarters, Archer.
That's rude, Mustang.
Don't move!
What's that?
That's so cruel.
Senior Lieutenant, don't shoot.
That's...
right.
Showtaker.
Alchemist.
Alchemist connecting life.
So it's you.
You don't approve of my methods either.
I don't remember ever supporting you.
I got myself into a mess
to find out the crime in the army.
There is no army without crime and evil.
Taker.
Taker.
Why are you doing such a stupid thing?
Just like you were before in Ishwar,
today I will become a hero.
They will die.
They will die.
They will all die.
How can a human being
understand the loyalty of these people
with an order?
Anyway,
it's good if they kill the scar.
It's good if they kill the scar.
It's good if they kill the scar.
It's good if they kill the scar.
It's good if they kill the scar.
It's good if they kill the scar.
And if they become the core
for the philosophical stone...
The philosophical stone?
It will be made.
It will never be in the hands of people.
In other words, it doesn't exist.
I'm sorry, but I can't remember anything.
I didn't feed you with hope.
You're not the girl
that my brother tried to revive.
You just look like her.
And if I turn into a human,
will I be like her?
No.
Why not?
Dead people don't come back to life.
What do you want to do?
Wait!
Don't come closer.
Shut up and watch.
What have you done?
I got this hand from my brother.
My brother used himself
as an alchemical circle
and took in the lives of the people
and the Shvar.
In order to create the world,
you have to kill the Shvar.
In order to create the world,
you have to kill the Shvar.
Do you want to make a philosophy stone
inside yourself?
It was given to you.
And now?
Don't get close to him.
You can't do anything right now.
Just watch.
Are you seriously going to make
a philosophy stone out of a boy?
We don't have time.
If you don't turn his body
into another material,
it will explode.
And then the philosophy stone...
So you're just going to give it to them?
I don't know if I can do it or not.
If it works, it will belong to them.
They can do anything with it.
I don't like it.
I want you to create
a real philosophy stone.
Turn the boy's body...
Enough of your nonsense!
If you kill me now,
will your wish come true?
All right.
If it turns out to be a real stone,
I'll take advantage of it.
What will happen to my younger brother?
What do I care?
Ed...
Stop...
the scar.
We need to move to some city
away from here.
Now?
You have to do something yourself.
And I'll go and catch the scar.
After all, the goal of the army is the scar.
Will you give the scar to the military?
Probably this is the only condition
that the people of Leor will forgive.
Don't, Ed.
Is it really possible?
You know.
Equal exchange.
Maybe I can do something
until I know what.
If I tell the colonel
about the secretary of the Fuhrer,
then...
All right.
I'll try to help.
Just don't hope too much.
You have to run now.
Before the military figure it out,
you have to be far away.
Yes.
Initially, we had such a plan.
Divide into small groups
and hide in some cities.
I rely on you, Laila.
Rose?
See you soon, Ed.
No.
Goodbye, Rose.
It seems that there is no one there.
Perhaps an unexpected attack.
There is someone there!
Colonel!
This is a state alchemist.
A scar.
There was a scar.
To scare us,
he brutally killed a state alchemist.
Tank division, block the city
along the perimeter.
Infantry, find the scar.
Forward!
The army should not have attacked.
So it's God's will.
He's here!
Stupid.
I won't die so easily.
I knew it.
But I didn't think about it.
Did you love me?
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
Did you love me?
I don't love you.
I hated my brother.
He turned away from teaching the Assyrian.
He studied alchemy.
And although
he gave me
this hand,
despite this
I had nothing
except hatred.
The Elricks live for each other's sake.
Yes.
The elder brother of the mountain stands for the younger one.
The younger one stands for the elder one.
I would also like to tell my brother that I love him.
That's why you did the same for this boy as your elder brother did for you.
Now go.
Now the nightmare will begin here.
What is your real name?
I got my name from our God.
However, when I turned away from Him, I lost this name.
Shram is here!
Farewell, Shram.
Stop! Stop!
So you're alive.
The people of Liora surrendered.
Only Shram is in the city.
They surrendered? I can't believe it.
They killed Bagrov's alchemist.
Is that your excuse?
The war is declared.
You can die if you want.
But because of your ridiculous thirst for fame, the soldiers who do not know anything ...
We have found a man who looks like Shram!
He punishes resistance!
Okay.
Stop!
Hey, wait!
Don't!
Don't!
Ed!
Ed!
It is impossible to sleep if you cause pain.
But I don't have to worry about it anymore.
I won't have to wait for sleep anymore.
Shram!
Bad!
What is it?
Colonel!
Idiots!
No!
It's all right with you.
More or less.
Colonel Archer ordered to attack.
Yes.
But it's so strange.
The city of Liora is overflowing with red light.
The connection with the troops is lost.
What is it?
What is it?
What?
Evacuate all survivors quickly.
Shram!
Al?
Ed?
Ed!
No!
Go away!
I'll explode!
Oh!
Al!
Why are you here?
Oh!
I'm the same as before again!
Ed!
I'm the same as before again!
My body is the same as before!
What?
I don't understand anything!
Well, yes.
Kimble turned me into a bomb.
But Shram said that I could be saved
if I turn my armor into something else.
And then...
Then...
Al!
Open your stomach!
Come on, open it!
Ed!
What is it?
Al!
The alchemical circle was recently used.
Shram transmuted the Philosopher's Stone
not inside himself, but...
Exactly, baby.
The younger brother was turned into a Philosopher's Stone.
I'm a Philosopher's Stone?
What does it mean?
Why?
Go away.
Soon everyone will start hunting for you.
Didn't you want to get the Philosopher's Stone yourself?
Ed!
No!
Al!
