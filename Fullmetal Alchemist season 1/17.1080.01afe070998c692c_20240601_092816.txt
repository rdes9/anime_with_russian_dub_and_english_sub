4 years later
It's so quiet here.
This is the province.
It's been 4 years.
Already 4?
Yes.
They never came back here?
Why would they come back if they don't have their own home?
Major, have you heard about our story in general?
Yes, I have.
What kind of guests!
Hello.
Winry, our clients are here.
When a person wants to get something,
he needs to sacrifice something.
So if you want to get something,
you have to give something equal in return.
In alchemy, this is called the law of equal exchange.
This is the law of equal exchange.
At that time, we believed
that this is the truth of the real world.

hey how are you
Oh, my God, this time you got a lot of trouble.
Well, all sorts of things happened.
And you're still the same kid.
Who's the kid here, little old lady?
Shut up or I'll kick your ass!
Shut up yourself, not the old lady!
Micromolec!
Old lady Bukasha!
Edward Ehrlich!
How dare you treat the Pashens like that?
Now Armstrong will take care of you.
This gentleman doesn't understand jokes at all.
I'm Alic Buyardong.
Pinakurogbal.
Brother!
Vena, what is it?
You decided to kill me?
I would kill a fool.
What did you do to yourself?
Damn it!
How could you break such a cool car armor?
I put all my soul into it.
Well, it broke pretty easily.
Al is also out of his mind.
Again, you got into something dangerous.
Well, what can I say?
Hey, kid.
And you grew up a little.
Kid was superfluous.
This means that you need to redo your leg.
And you need to do your hand from scratch.
Can you lie down for a week?
We're in a hurry.
You're offending me.
Three days.
Sorry, granny.
Guys, why are you in such a hurry?
We want to go back to the headquarters as soon as possible.
We need to find something very important there.
Is there anything suspicious?
No.
Really?
Not at all.
There are some problems with you.
Winry can grumble as much as she wants.
But she always tries.
Yeah.
The parts are the same.
But granny has to work.
And nothing changes here after all.
Yeah.
Mr. Armstrong, tell me.
What are our boys doing now?
They don't come to our deaf news from the city.
And they never sent letters.
I was worried about them after all.
The Eureka brothers.
Especially the steel alchemist,
known in the headquarters.
A lot has happened to them during this time.
But they don't come to our deaf news.
Everything has happened.
But don't worry.
These guys are strong.
Strong?
Save me, brother!
Hold on!
It hurts!
We need to go back to the headquarters as soon as possible.
To find material about the Philosopher's Stone.
I agree.
But it's better not to think about anything now.
Take a rest.
When we come back, there will be problems again.
Yeah.
It's not my character to be sick like this.
Brother.
Go to the grave to your mother.
To the grave?
As soon as the car is repaired,
we'll go on the road.
So you'd better go now.
I'll stay here.
Yeah.
I'll be back soon.
Mrs. Pinako.
The fire is over.
Thank you.
You should have a rest too.
No.
A soldier should not neglect his daily training.
By the way, I don't see Edward.
He said he went to his mother's grave.
And I told him that it was dangerous to go alone.
Everything is fine.
He has great security.
Oh, Ed!
You're back!
Yeah.
Long time no see.
More than four years have passed,
and you're still so short.
I'm not short.
You're still doing something state-owned.
I am.
Take care of yourself.
You're so small.
Small?
Enough!
What happened?
What are you thinking about?
Winry, this is a girl.
Oh, Nelly!
We often played with you in childhood.
We played hide-and-seek, we ran to the river.
Really?
Is something wrong?
I couldn't remember her face.
Yeah.
She grew up and changed a lot.
I see.
Al,
let's
bring mom back.
Let's go home, Dan.
Are those the same watches?
What?
Yeah, they act as an amplifier for alchemical transmu...
Nice!
Huh?
Thin, filigree work.
And what kind of work is that?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Thin, filigree work.
And what kind of work is that?
Handle, washing machine.
Does it start manually or automatically?
It never bothered me.
Please, can I find out?
Are you kidding?
You should give them to me.
You'll figure it out.
You're the last screw.
Give it to me.
Oh, come on.
I'll figure it out and put it away as it was.
Please, come on.
You can't ask someone else.
Well, I guess I'll go and get some firewood.
How greedy!
Al!
Huh?
Grandma says that tomorrow they'll attach my hand.
And I'll repair your armor right away.
Okay.
Huh?
Ed!
Did I have friends?
What?
What are you talking about?
I can't remember the faces of my friends.
It's all in my memory.
Well, of course.
Memories are such a thing.
They accumulate one after the other.
And the oldest ones fade away.
Seriously?
Al, listen.
Huh?
I...
I was going to tell you a long time ago.
But it was so scary that I couldn't.
About what?
About...
Well, tell me.
No, after all...
Ed!
I'll kill you!
Ed!
Dear people!
Just look at these beautiful stars!
Shining in the sky!
This is the blessing of the sky that you won't see in cities.
What a good place this village of Rizambul is!
Even if it's deserted, there's a lot of things that aren't in cities.
We used to look at the stars like that.
Right, Al?
Yeah.
So, finally, the long-awaited meeting point is coming.
It's not the first time for me, but when I connect my nerves...
Don't complain.
You want to go to the city center as soon as possible, don't you?
That's right.
I want to return to my previous body as soon as possible and say goodbye to this pain.
Too bad.
Such an income client will disappear.
That's right.
Why do you have to strain yourself and return to what you were?
The smell of oil, the squeak of artificial muscles, the hum of bearings...
Auto armor is amazing!
A maniac, mechanic.
And you yourself are a maniac, alchemic.
Well, let's get started.
One...
Two...
Hey, you two!
Ed will be resting here.
Go away.
The pain from the connection is so strong.
Even adults cry and shout.
It's not that simple.
Well?
We've reduced the weight of the waist by 80% compared to the previous version.
It will be terrible if you stop growing only from the fact that the armor weighs a lot.
Listen, you...
A person suffers here.
Don't tell me about the growth.
Everything will be fine.
The main thing is that you are healthy.
Does nothing bother you?
No.
Since everything has become easier, the strength is a little lower.
Therefore, I ask you to be careful.
Auto armor can be replaced, and life is one.
Even my head is spinning from the fact that I worked all night.
Thank you, Winry.
Well, did I earn a ticket to the express?
Al!
Are you all right, brother?
Yes.
Like a new one.
Great!
I'll fix you right now.
Are these all pieces of armor?
Yes.
And you?
Are these all pieces of armor?
Yes.
Major and the people of Mustang have picked up all the pieces.
Can you fix everything right away?
There is one trick.
Here is a special mark.
It connects the soul of Al and the armor.
It was so dangerous.
If only we had dug a little deeper.
Under any circumstances, we must protect this mark.
This is the main thing that connects the soul of Al and the armor.
It looks like blood is written on it.
Yes, my blood.
I wrote what I could.
What?
What kind of brotherly love is this?
Unusual thoughts!
Don't move, you're in the way.
Let's go.
Not bad.
Thank you, brother.
Well, Slavnik.
Let's do it as always.
As always?
Yes.
Our teacher said that in order to set the spirit on fire, you first need to set the body on fire.
That's why we always arrange training battles with Al.
However, I have never won.
Here it is.
Then I'll help you.
Thank you.
No need.
Well, let's start.
Hey, be careful.
Don't break the armor.
Here it is.
We forgot about everything.
As if we were children.
I'm the next one.
After all, the things made by the order of the
detective.
Exquisite form.
Amazing handwork.
Inside, too, probably great.
It seems to see how it wants to disassemble, how it wants to assemble again.
So.
Hmm.
Weak.
You'd better not move.
That's it.
It's the same.
It's the same.
It's the same.
It's the same.
It's the same.
Well, have you given up already?
This is...
Are you giving up already?
It worked!
We won!
We won!
We won!
Winry?
What happened?
I'm sorry.
I was watching.
Listen!
I'm sorry.
Forgive me.
Damn it!
I didn't even show it to Alla.
I'm sorry.
Maybe it's a manifestation of weakness.
But I will always carry this warning
and reminder to myself.
Ed?
We don't have parents
or a home to go back to.
All that's left is to move forward.
Why?
Why?
Don't you have a home?
Don't you have a grandmother?
And me?
How stupid.
Why are you so angry?
You brothers don't cry.
That's why I cry for you.
Where...
Where did Alla go?
It's okay.
They'll come back when they can.
Just wait for them as always.
There was an entrance and a living room here.
In the cold days we used to heat the stove with firewood.
And the brother used to burn the firewood.
When we were walking until late,
Mom was looking at us from the window on the second floor.
The lamp was burning so brightly.
Wherever we played,
we could see it and ran home.
That's right.
Don't you have a home
where your family is waiting for you?
Brother, look.
Mother!
Boys, come back to eat from time to time.
Of course, we'll come back.
Grandma, thank you.
Thank you for the welcome.
Have a nice trip.
Thank you.
Granny!
I saw that inside Ed's clock.
There is a date when they set fire to the house and went away.
I want to see you.

Only a handful of truth has risen from the ashes.
