        <pre>Mr. Elric!
Finally!
You've come to your senses!
Where am I?
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
At that time we believed that this is the truth that rules the world.
The scene is blowing away, dancing like it's rolling.
Even if I die, I can no longer see the target.
I wish I could burn the map that I can't reach.
I'll grab the truth buried in my hands with my own hands.
I've been running through the universe.
Your voice is echoing in such a noisy, about to burst into pieces.
It seems that there is no time to stop here.
There you go!
Ah, please trust me!
I'm sorry.
I'll fix it as soon as I can.
Edward, what actually happened in the fifth lab?
Nothing.
Nothing?
And such wounds?
I'm telling you, nothing terrible.
Just a little more and I'd do anything.
Next time, don't be so stupid...
Edward!
I'm sorry in advance for being rude.
You were on the verge of death.
You need to understand that you're still a child.
Maybe it's still worth trusting an adult a little.
I'm sorry for the behavior of an unworthy junior in rank.
I'm sorry!
Oh, no.
You're the one who should forgive me.
Oh, it turns out that this is part of the Edo brothers.
Oh, how I am!
A young, beautiful and talented car armor technician made such a mistake!
Something's wrong.
No, no.
Everything is fine.
Honestly, honestly.
Hello?
Prothesis lab, Rockbell.
Winry?
Ed?
Listen, my right hand stopped moving.
Still?
Still.
I told you that because we reduced the weight, the prosthesis lost its strength.
It seems that you were careless again, right?
Anyway, I can't come to you.
I just don't know what to do.
Then I'll come to you.
I'll be with you in a moment, so wait.
Why are you so kind today?
What?
I'm always kind.
I'll be grateful if you come.
This time you'll do everything right.
Yeah.
The next day
Hello, Ed.
Can you get up?
Lieutenant Colonel.
Al, are you okay?
Yes.
Oh, by the way, guys, don't buy me lunch.
I'll go.
Lieutenant Ross, make him company.
Yes, sir.
Sorry, I was so hungry.
As for the fifth laboratory,
what happened there was explained by writing down everything about the criminal actions of Shuram, who persecuted you.
But, of course, this does not satisfy me.
A huge number of corpses that look suspiciously like chimeras.
Various equipment that worked until yesterday.
Several prisoners who were brought there forcibly claim that they saw the recently killed Brigadier General Basco Grano.
Ed.
What should I know about this?
Come on, tell me what you saw.
Homunculi.
Homunculi?
It can't be.
Homunculi.
Homunculi.
Homunculi.
It can't be.
And yet, they were not humans.
Is this related to the Philosopher's Stone?
They tried to make me create such a stone,
in favor of living people, prisoners.
It can't be.
Is that so, Al?
Guards, who have only souls.
A very dangerous type, nicknamed Envy.
Tattoos.
A fisherman.
An alchemical circle for creating a Philosopher's Stone.
That's what I saw there.
A simple stone.
Mark told me that during the uprising in the east, a Philosopher's Stone was used.
And Homunculi say that I'm alive only because they need me.
Thank you for the story.
The rest is up to me.
Have a rest, Envy.
I'm going to the hospital.
I'm going to the hospital.
I'm going to the hospital.
The rest is up to me.
Have a rest.
Now you just have to think about yourself.
Finally, you made it.
Well, well.
He said he would leave the landmark.
Envy.
I'm here, Mr. Winry.
Thank you for the way.
Here he is.
How come?
Why didn't you say you were in the hospital?
Yeah, I didn't think about it.
Nothing funny.
Winry.
I didn't repair it properly, so...
That's why you survived.
No, you don't have anything to do with it.
Yes, Al?
Yes.
Well, did you calm down?
Yes.
Your repair is just perfect.
Only that from time to time the hand stops moving.
Although stop it at another moment.
Maybe something worse happened to me.
And it broke because I used it carelessly.
In any case, I don't care.
Maybe he didn't notice that I forgot to tighten the screw.
Of course, as always, you are too careless.
Excuse me.
The lieutenant colonel is calling you.
Colonel Mustang.
Hi.
Did you call on time?
I have good news.
Did you find the scar?
Isn't it good news?
Did you forget?
Tomorrow is Elise's birthday.
If you don't want to turn into coal now, report the situation.
Don't worry, I'll contact you as soon as something happens.
And you better send a gift for Elise.
Bye.
And about what happened, it's probably not worth reporting.
It's not worth it.
Now he doesn't need to know about it.
Tell me better.
How are you doing with the reports that I asked for?
Spring vacation, I finally finished my job.
Well, then this is the next task.
How are you, Ed?
Oh, have you already had time to eat everything?
Then let's take care of the repair.
Did you leave the milk?
Ed?
Yes, you are cruel to me with this milk.
What are you saying?
Milk is good for your throat.
Oh, stop it, I hate it.
I won't die without milk.
That's why I'm staying with you.
Crumple.
Crumple?
Yes, crumple.
Isn't that right, Al?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Maybe you are right, Al?
Ed, you can't do that.
You need to drink.
Well, you like it, Al.
You are so big that you can drink milk.
I...
I'm not my own will anymore.
I'm sorry.
What's wrong with you, guys?
Al!
Did something happen?
Listen...
Why?
Why don't you tell me anything about your injuries?
I'm so worried about you!
Why don't you tell me anything important?
Ed?
I don't want to see you!
Hello! Nice to meet you, Winry.
I'm Lieutenant Colonel Miles Hughes.
Please come in.
Oh, nice to meet you.
This is my sweet Alice.
She's so cute, isn't she?
You want to meet her, don't you?
Yes, but...
Okay, I'll arrange a meeting.
How?
I'll take Winry with me.
Hello, everyone!
You're so lucky!
Because tomorrow is my Alice's birthday!
And this video, too.
Yes.
We need to give him a present.
What will you give Alice?
Tell me!
What?
A teddy bear?
And a big one!
Alice will be very happy!
What?
Happy birthday!
Happy birthday!
Happy birthday, Alice!
Happy birthday to you!
Happy birthday!
And the apples are the best of all!
That's what I'm talking about!
My daughter is the best!
That's great, Alice!
I like it here, too!
Alice!
Alice!
Alice!
Alice!
Alice!
Alice!
Alice!
Alice!
Alice!
Alice!
Alice!
Alice!
Alice!
Alice!
Alice!
Happy birthday!
This is your gift!
Thanks!
Sister, a bookworm!
A bookworm?
Sister!
Alice, can you tell me how old you are?
One, two, three...
Four years!
You're so happy!
Sister!
Congratulations! Congratulations!
What?
Daddy said, the more people congratulate you, the more good things will happen.
That's why I'm telling you.
Elise.
You look like two sisters.
Yes. I'd like to have such a younger sister.
I'm the only child.
But you have brothers.
If they were real brothers, they would tell me more.
And they don't tell me anything serious since childhood.
Don't be sad.
Judges don't judge men by their words, but by their actions.
Yes.
When troubles happen, they quietly deal with them,
without putting a knife on others,
without making them worry.
Here are the guys and they are silent.
They have no one except you.
Sooner or later, the guys will be honest with you.
When the time comes, I hope you will understand them.
Maybe it will be for the best.
If the older sister is like this, the younger brothers will hardly have fun.
Mr. Inglis.
Here you are.
Sorry for the wait. I baked a cake for Eda's birthday.
Come on.
Please.
I thought you wanted to give this gift to Eda.
What are you talking about?
There are no gifts that can be compared to Winry's smile.
Congratulations!
They say that the more they congratulate you on your birthday,
the happier you will be.
This is from Glacier.
Oh.
She taught me how to bake it.
So when you can eat it, I will cook it for you at any time.
Remember?
In childhood, the three of us ate cakes.
Yes.
I remember one time, Dan ate a cake for Alla.
And Alla was so excited.
Exactly.
Was it like that?
Maybe you were still too young.
You don't remember, so...
Something happened.
Until the repair of the prosthesis is over, I will be outside.
Alla.
Are you all right now?
Yes.
Then I'll come back for you later.
Thank you.
Eda, listen.
Did something happen to Alla?
I...
I had a terrible fight with him.
I didn't dare.
What?
I had a chance to return his former appearance.
But I didn't dare.
Why?
I had to sacrifice other people.
Compared to Alla, I shouldn't have any business with them.
But I couldn't kill them.
And he was near and saw everything.
You did the right thing.
Even if it returned his former appearance,
but others would have been sacrificed,
Alla would not have been happy about it.
But...
Maybe Alla is angry at the fact
that you were going to sacrifice people at some point.
If your character and your memories are created by your brother
for his own convenience, then what?
These are homunculi.
Perfectly artificially created people.
Was I really a human?
Done.
That's it. Let's go to Alla.
But...
What should I tell him?
Are you still asking?
Just apologize.
Say sorry.
You never have enough words.
Okay.
Alla...
I'm sorry.
I'll fix you now.
Look, I brought so many things from Risenburg.
Alla, I won't give up.
We'll find another way to get our former appearance back.
Trust me.
You, brother,
maybe you can get your former appearance back.
Can I?
Of course.
Don't worry.
Let's get started.
So?
Did you attach the soul to the armor just like that?
Yes.
Together with the memories.
Memories aren't just data.
An alchemist like you can easily create and attach human memories.
Are you really thinking about me like that?
Brother,
you started to tell me something in Risenburg, but you stopped.
You said you couldn't ask before, because you were afraid.
You wanted to say that my soul and memories were created by you, right?
No, I meant...
Enough!
It turns out that there was no man named Alphonse Elric in this world.
What are you talking about?
You've always been together.
And we, me and grandma Pinaco...
Believe us!
What do you want me to believe?
What does an empty body like me have to believe?
Can't it be that you're all fooling me?
Did you keep it to yourself all the time?
Is that all you wanted to say?
You answer my question first.
Why don't you say anything?
Why?
Let me go!
I don't want to live!
Fool!
Let me go!
Let me go!
Let me go!
Don't come any closer!
Don't come any closer!
Leave me alone!
Help!
Help me!
Help me!
Help me!
Help me!
Help me!
Help me!
Help me!
Help me!
