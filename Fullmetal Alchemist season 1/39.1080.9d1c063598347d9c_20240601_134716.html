So you can't say anything about it?
I'm talking about the alien!
Now shut up!
I don't think you can accidentally go to the substation.
What were you doing there?
Wait.
What are you going to do next?
Listen, Rose.
Something is happening in the army.
Something very dangerous.
Thank you.
Winry, what are we going to do next?
I'm going to go back to Risenburg first.
I wanted to talk to Ed and Alla, but I don't know where they are.
What? How can I be there?
Who are you talking about? You will go with me.
What about my books?
Just leave them.
Well, now you can take it off.
I can.
It's easier.
Cover it.
I see someone, Mr. Fire Major.
No, I'm sorry, Colonel.
I'm sorry, Colonel.
I'm sorry, Colonel.
I'm sorry, Colonel.
I'm sorry, Colonel.
I'm sorry, Colonel.
No, I'm sorry, Colonel.
Is something wrong?
Archer, what does it mean?
It's Lieutenant Colonel Zolov J. Kimbley, an alchemist.
What is it?
Lieutenant Colonel?
The Lieutenant Colonel was sentenced to prison for a false accusation,
but he was able to escape before he was used in illegal experiments on people in the fifth lab.
Thanks to Lieutenant Colonel's testimony, the truth about the lab was revealed.
False accusation?
Don't talk nonsense.
Please don't forget that the Fuhrer summoned me as Lieutenant Colonel in connection with the upcoming operation.
By the way, where did the signal come from?
Oh, right. Do you know the city of Leor?
What?
What's going on?
When a person wants to get something, he needs to sacrifice something.
Therefore, if you want to get something, you have to replace it with something equal.
In alchemy, this is called the law of equal exchange.
At that time, we believed that this is the truth that rules the world.
The crab was laughing innocently.
I wonder if I can go back to that time.
It's like a broken glass cycle.
I'm collecting the fragments of my memories.
I always realize what's important after losing it.
Please, please, stop time.
Please engrave your face in my heart.
If you are forgiven, you can sacrifice everything.
Let's love that smile one more time.
The End
So it's you.
Yes, it's me. I killed greed.
Ed, why are you telling this now?
Martell, I don't know what you think about it.
But for me, you are the greed of the criminals who kidnapped my brother.
And Gamuncu was also killed by Dante.
Martell!
Be careful!
A snake?
But you are not my enemy.
Greed decided that death was better than a new end.
He was very proud.
That's why he wanted you to defeat him.
I hate the military who killed my comrades.
I hate those two in black clothes.
And the one who betrayed his people.
Himblik!
Oh, God!
Here, eat it. It's nutritious.
Are you going to eat it yourself?
No, it would be cannibalism.
We are not far from Leora, are we?
What?
Yes.
I wonder how Rosa is doing.
And who is Rosa?
Don't pretend you forgot. You didn't worry about it either.
Hey, Martell, when will we get to Ishvar?
An hour ago.
We've been in Ishvar for a long time.
Is that Ishvar?
One of the ruins, Ed.
That definitely won't help us find Sharama.
And what are you looking for?
Philosopher's Stone.
They say that before we can find Sharama,
we have to go to the other side of the world.
That's right.
We have to go to the other side of the world.
Philosopher's Stone.
They say that before Ishvar fell,
a Philosopher's Stone was created here.
I can't believe it.
They were all killed.
They were unarmed. They couldn't resist.
It can't be that they couldn't resist.
In Ishvar, by that time, it was already restless.
And then it happened that one of the officers killed a civilian.
And then Ishvar rose.
So this is the official version.
I didn't know it.
I've been in the lab for more than 14 years.
Since the time of that crazy Ishvar?
I look young because I was turned into a chimera.
But I'll be of age to you, older sisters.
Ma'am!
I'm sorry.
We were in a special squad.
We didn't talk about the goals or the details of the operation
until the last moment.
But it was an ordinary practice.
What happened?
What's going on?
We're in trouble.
What's going on?
We were ordered to infiltrate the city of Ishvar
and carry out large-scale cleaning operations there.
We were told that the Ishvars were going to hold a terrorist act in the headquarters.
And we were supposed to prevent it.
Let's go.
It caused an Ishvar uprising.
I don't understand anything.
Then just listen.
Right after the war in Ishwar, we were arrested.
And those who resisted...
Hey! What does all this mean?
We were following orders!
All those who survived were taken to the fifth lab.
Dolchevsky!
Martell!
It's him!
It's him!
It's...
Martell!
It's...
Martell!
You've become chemists.
You've become chemists.
We wanted to shut our mouths completely.
But why?
It's a secret that should never have been revealed.
The truth about the beginning of military actions.
But why?
Why did the military choose Ishwar?
People!
Who's there?
What?
You won't get away!
Oh!
There you are.
Now tell me what you were doing here.
This territory is not allowed to enter.
We had to check the security of the old villages of Ishwar.
You could have done it openly,
instead of sneaking up on us.
Right.
This is a state alchemist,
even if he doesn't look like one.
Are you rats?
Ed, maybe these people...
Hi.
Is that you?
So the colonel is here.
So, so.
What a familiar face.
Yes, yes.
You're not mistaken.
It's me.
The same rascal,
who can't be seen from the ground.
As I've heard,
have you been to a lot of places?
Southern headquarters,
then the train of deported Ishvars.
Anyway,
now you're under my control.
Wait!
It's just a fate
that you ran into the Havoc patrol.
But we have the permission
to act on our own.
However, in case of a call,
I will become an army dog.
Ed!
A military echelon in this border area
can't be an accident.
Could it be...
You're the Havoc patrol?
Could it be...
a war?
We just need to suppress
the restless districts.
The target is a city
two kilometers south-southeast.
Isn't that too much for you?
Too much, then?
I can assume
it's because of the scar,
right?
And we're looking for it too.
Why are you following the scar?
If we don't get rid of it now,
then you won't get away with it.
Hey, Alphonse,
can you pretend you're not eating?
Oh, yeah.
I'm going to beat up this auntie!
I'm going to beat up this auntie!
I'm going to beat up this auntie!
What's this?
Photos were taken
from the latest
reconnaissance balloon.
It's...
It can't be!
The whole city is in an alchemical circle!
Who could have done this?
The scar...
It's him, after all.
Edward,
you know his goals, don't you?
No.
What kind of city is it?
The city is called Leor.
Last year, a priest
who held the city in his hands
left the department
and thanks to the intervention
of the military,
the world was ruled there.
He knows.
In Leor?
The armed uprising in Leor?
It can't be!
The world returned to the city
when we overthrew
this fraud priest!
No.
After that, the city
was divided into supporters
and opponents of the abbot.
There was a terrible fight there,
and now both sides are fighting
with the sent troops.
Why didn't you tell me about this?
Initially, I was...
I received a report
about this from Hughes,
but I didn't tell you.
Why?
Because it's too difficult
a task for you.
You're right.
Ed and Al don't know
anything about Hughes' death.
Apparently, they don't.
If we tell them about it now,
they'll rush to the headquarters.
They're a good support.
This is his brother
in a dangerous situation.
Mustang must have thought so.
Tell me, didn't my brother come?
You will report to me directly.
And if you keep my terms, I'll give you permission to do so.
Ed, what are you doing here?
According to his insistent request, Ed is going to scout the city of Lior.
You are sending a valuable state alchemist to inspect the landmarks?
That is why he has a great chance of coming back alive.
Besides, he knows Lior better than anyone else.
Don't worry, he says he's leaving his younger brother here.
I don't think he will run away alone, leaving his dear Alla here.
Why didn't you tell me?
Would you have given me permission if I had told you?
Having learned that Lior was going to speak, you clearly got angry.
I'm going to cool down a little.
It's so hot!
Be careful, you are a fugitive criminal for the military.
Ed, are you serious?
Going to Lior alone?
Leaving you here was one of the conditions.
This type of archer doesn't trust us at all.
That alchemical circle, is it really for the Philosopher's Stone?
If so, I will destroy it.
Martell, behave yourself.
I understand.
Didn't I put up with this type of archer?
First I will kill those in black and Kimble.
And I will avenge the military later.
I won't let you do that.
Ed, please take care of yourself.
Yeah.
Major?
You are here too?
Colonel Archer.
I ordered you to leave your watch here.
I see. It will be unpleasant if you find out who I am.
Edward Elric, why are you here?
It's fate, I guess.
Doesn't look like you.
You don't believe in fate.
Here are the new silver watches.
You must make a transmutation amplifier out of them.
I see.
You were kicked out of the city because of the archer?
Yeah, that Colonel turned out to be a scary guy.
Listen,
I'm going to kill you.
I'm going to kill you.
I'm going to kill you.
I'm going to kill you.
I'm going to kill you.
I'm going to kill you.
I'm going to kill you.
The archer turned out to be a scary guy.
Listen,
I think I've seen you somewhere before.
Yeah, I get confused very often with someone.
Holy Mother!
Look, there she is!
You're lucky.
That's the Holy Mother.
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Rosa!
Come back!
The colonel ordered you not to show up in public!
Because it's assumed that I'm already dead!
But at least I can do what I want at night!
But...
How did you get me?
Kimble!
Yes?
Who would have thought that we would meet the baby again here?
What are we going to do about the feast?
I'm so proud of you!
That Ishwar is here!
We have to kill everyone who finds out the truth about Ishwar!
It's a pity!
The smell!
The smell!
I can smell him!
The beast Ishwar!
Come on!
