Season 3
я опять пришла
Damn it, Winry, how did you manage to deal with these cursed machines?
What are we going to do? Daishvara is pretty far away.
What to do, what to do? Go on and that's it.
What? It's impossible. I'm fine, but you definitely can't get there.
What do you suggest? There are no railways here.
Ordinary railways are blocked.
And they won't let us pass through the posts.
That's true, but...
In any case, we need to go. If we stay here, Ishvar himself won't come to us.
Ed, we need some kind of plan.
When a person wants to get something, he needs to sacrifice something.
In this way, if you want to get something, you need to give something equal in return.
In alchemy, this is called the law of equal exchange.
At that time, we believed that this is the truth that rules the world.
The End
Well, look, everything is fine.
It's fine. We just got to the city.
If this is a real city, we can get the car or something else.
Nothing will come out. We are still children. Who will sell us a car?
Well, something will work out.
Ed, why are you always like this? You need to think a little forward.
And I'm just thinking.
You're not thinking.
And what we are going to do...
What's the matter?
Is it right?
I understand that we want to stop the scar.
But our main goal is to return the former appearance.
And if so...
What if so? What are you talking about?
I don't know.
Maybe we should first of all deal not with the scar, but with the homunculus?
Al, are you thinking for yourself? What are you talking about?
I want to say, maybe there are other ways.
I don't understand anything.
In any case, we must first think about everything.
I'm sick of it! Think for yourself!
What are you doing?
And there is nothing to get me.
Well, then here you are.
You'll get cold a little.
Well, hold on.
What did you get?
I'll show you.
Here you are.
Well, wait.
You jumped!
Ed, why are you always so stubborn?
I'm not stubborn.
And you still argue.
If you weren't like this, we could have asked for advice from your father.
I don't want to hear!
Whatever happens, I will not accept his help.
This is called stubbornness.
Shut up!
Do as you know.
Brother!
Ed, wait!
We haven't seen each other for a long time.
What was your name?
The book devil?
Oh, no, the book worm.
My name is Chesna.
Oh, yes.
And you, I remember, Win-Win.
I'm Winry.
Excuse me.
You know what?
Excuse me.
You know what?
What?
No, you're the first.
How can I explain?
I would like to talk to you.
To consult.
With me?
I've been finding out all this time why Lieutenant Colonel Hughes,
that is, Brigadier General Hughes, died.
Lieutenant Colonel, that is, Brigadier General...
Maybe it's better just Hughes?
Well, of course, of course.
And?
It's strange.
Strange?
The more I found out the circumstances, the more strange things came up.
I don't know what to do.
But you chose me.
I can't trust anyone from the military.
Even Colonel Mustang.
Please, I can't stand it anymore.
If anyone listens to me, then I...
I...
I understand.
I understand.
Calm down.
Thank you.
Really.
Well, what did you find out about him?
What kind of jokes are these?
Oh, pass me the salt.
Damn it.
Here.
I rewrote these materials that Hughes asked me to collect.
Based on them, I collected these materials on my own initiative.
That is, you want me to read all this?
Yes.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
You want me to read all this?
And you can't?
No, of course not.
How do you think how many months I spent on this?
That's how it is.
Well, then I'll do it myself.
It all started with the destruction of the fifth laboratory.
Since there are no records left, I don't know what happened there.
But after that, Hughes began to conduct his own investigation.
And?
Did you notice something?
Yes.
Hughes conducted an investigation on the fifth laboratory and about the war in Ishvara.
Ishvara?
I just assume that Hughes found out some very important military secret that he shouldn't have known and ...
Was killed?
That's it, that's it, I understand.
Salga, don't cry.
Ed, you're a fool.
Al, do you even understand what you're talking about?
Of course I understand.
At least what is waiting for us next.
Ed, where are you going?
Oh!
Martell!
Hello, hello.
In these documents, I came across the name of one person.
A person?
Juliet Douglas.
Captain Douglas, as they say, provoked the beginning of the war in Ishvara.
But there is something strange here.
She seems to have died from an accident two years before the beginning of the war.
What?
Look here.
But what is it?
It was in Hughes' folder.
Received from her hometown.
A year of her death and really two years before the beginning of the war.
But maybe there's some kind of mistake here?
Maybe a mistake in the records or the last name?
There are no mistakes in official papers and military records.
Besides ...
Besides?
She is still serving in the army.
Look.
What is it?
Judging by the tomb, she died.
What is it?
Judging by the tomb, she died two years before the beginning of the civil war in Ishvara.
However, according to military documents, it turns out that she was not eliminated from the military lists.
She participated in the civil war, and now she has moved on to serve the secretary of the Führer.
Isn't it strange?
The man who died is the secretary of the Führer?
And that's not all.
What else?
If she were still alive, she would have been no less than fifty.
And the secretary of the Führer Giulietti, no matter how you look at it, is just over thirty years old.
She does not die, regardless of her own death.
She is not old.
Who is she?
It's hard to explain.
But after a long thought, I came to one thought.
What thought?
If my assumptions are correct, I can resolve all contradictions.
Giulietta Douglas, she is an alien.
No, I think it's not true.
No?
But what could it be?
I do not know.
However, if we figure it out, we will find out who killed the Führer.
But how?
In principle, I serve in the army, but I just answer for the documents.
And Giulietta Douglas with the Führer will never get close to her.
I can not even find out the situation.
And what if we listen to her?
Then we will find out something else.
Listening?
This is the thing that men arrange to prove the wrong wife, right?
I can hardly.
I can!
I can!
I will find out everything!
Martell, why are you here?
I was watching you.
I want you to tell me about the enemy.
The enemy?
About those people in black.
What are you going to do when you find out?
It's clear that I'll take revenge.
My shape is too small for you.
When work requires physical strength, hands get fat.
Maybe you should go on a diet?
What do you think?
Yes.
Do you know these two?
Yes, we met before.
It's here.
All phone lines should be collected in this building.
But there are so many locks.
And the emergency system should be very reliable.
So we can not get in there.
Ready, open!
It was very simple.
Great.
Let's go.
What is the room number?
Room 103 in the central building.
103-103.
Got it.
Here.
Done.
Now we wait, that's it.
You are wrong.
So you are jealous and low
and others are trying to defend you.
You understand who I am.
I'm a chimera and can not live anymore as an ordinary person.
Guys and greed.
I lost everyone who took me.
So you take revenge?
You will not stop me.
I'm the half of a snake and so revengeful.
Well, not.
It looks like a scar.
I have nothing left.
They and your enemies too.
That's why I...
I won't help you.
And I won't let you do it.
Why?
Loa and the others probably thought so too.
Goodbye.
That's right.
That's why I have to stop the scar and the mortel.
Al! Al!
It's not that easy to find him.
Edward!
Hey, Edward!
I can't find Alphonse.
Did something happen?
I don't want to know about him.
Did you have a fight?
It's his fault.
He's always whining and whining.
When will he stop whining?
I don't want to know about him.
Did you have a fight?
It's his fault.
He's always whining and whining.
When will he stop whining?
I'm worried.
Where did Alphonse go?
I can't imagine where he could be.
Why me?
Let's go.
Okay, let's go.
Okay.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello??
Hello??
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Oh, yes, we can.
This conversation, what was it about?
I don't understand.
About what?
About something dangerous.
I think we'll need a lot more time to find evidence.
It turns out that even listening
did not help us in any way.
What to do?
What is it?
What is it?
Look!
Quick!
What is it?
How do I know?
What? What happened?
It's a girl. It's her.
It's her!
Out!
Winry!
Mom!
It's you, mom, Ed and Ella!
Winry!
Winry, it's you!
What are you doing here?
Alive!
She's definitely an alien!
Who? Who?
Okay, let's go.
Ed!
Let's go to Ishvar.
Let's stop Mr. Shram.
How did you know I was there?
You haven't changed.
What?
You've always been on the bank of the river
after we had a fight.
Well, what are we going to do next?
What to do, what to do.
All we have to do is go.
To bring you?
Martell?
Al, do you know her?
Well, yes.
Well, let's take advantage of the kindness.
Thank you very much!
Wait, Ed!
Why not?
We need to help each other.
I will definitely stop you.
So, let's go!
Yes!
What is it?
Nothing.
Ed, do you remember
when we had a fistfight for the first time?
You hit me so hard then.
I went to the river for the first time.
Really?
Yes.
And when we were already studying,
you also disappeared after the fight.
I was forced to work for two.
And we argued
who would take Winry to his wife.
Well, did it really happen?
Yes, it did.
To believe in love
is to not lose to yourself
until the day your dream comes true.
Look at the stars with a smile
and offer your prayers
because I am here.
I want to be in the sky for you.
Even sadness is wrapped around you.
Whenever I look up,
I feel like I'm not alone
and I feel like I'm far away.
I feel like I have a place to return to.
