Episode One
Good luck to you, soldier.
The smell of a madman and a scoundrel.
But he's not here anymore.
Ed, listen.
What's going to happen to Dr. Mark?
They said that he is now under the protection of the Fuhrer.
What can we do now?
The Central Library?
Mark was able to hide all the materials under the very nose of the soldier.
What does this mean?
I don't know.
Let's keep it a secret from the colonel and so on.
What are you doing?
I stopped understanding.
We have to do something.
What do you mean?
I stopped understanding.
Can we trust him?
When a person wants to get something, he needs to sacrifice something.
So, if you want to get something, you have to give something equal in return.
In alchemy, this is called the law of equal exchange.
At that time, we believed that this was the truth that ruled the world.
And now we have to do something.
What do you mean?
I don't know.
Let's keep it a secret from the colonel and so on.

In alchemy...
I have to be punished.
Punished?
Knowing where the Crystal Alchemist is,
I didn't let it go.
You did everything right.
Huh?
I wanted to protect him myself.
My direct subordinate,
Gran, was against it.
We made Mark suffer
by using his developments.
And now it's too late to change anything.
But I want to somehow compensate his suffering.
Yes.
However, these researches...
That's all.
I rely on you for the rest.
Have a good trip.
The Philosopher's Stone
does not exist.
See? Everything is fine.
Maybe you would benefit
if you were punished at least once.
This man does not allow such misdeeds.

The method of attaching the soul to the armor
is known only by one.

Yes.
But first,
we need to do something with this hand.
That's right.
Edward, if he can't use alchemy...
This is just a kid
who likes to swear at everyone.
In any case,
I'm going to my mechanic.
You know her, Colonel.
Yes.
The alchemist who cries from pain.
It hurts.
I'm going to describe it.
Something like that.
What are you going to do
when they repair it?
I want to find out
something in the library in the central office.
It will be a rather long trip.
It will be a rather long trip.
If so,
I will have to accompany
Fyurova and everyone else.
I can't just leave this place like that.
And I have to look after her.
I'm not sure
that I can protect the guys
from such a terrible type.
We have too!
That's decided.
In this journey,
both guards will take care of your patrols.
I don't need guards.
And if you are attacked by a scar again,
what are you going to do in this form?
You can't drag Yala.
You can't.
I...
Children should listen to adults.
Children should listen to adults.
Who are the children here?
Al, tell him something!
Crap!
Since I got out of prison,
they've been acting like a child!
So, Edward Elric,
let's pack our things.
Hahahaha!
Hahahaha!
Hahahaha!
Hahahaha!
Since I was on TV,
they've been acting like a child!
Please, newspaper.
Kysh, Kysh!
I have three messages.
From Colonel?
I don't like to investigate,
so I'm not allowed to die in a sub-region.
I see. I'm not going to die before you, Colonel Krenov, so tell me.
And by the way, take this guard off of me.
Hey, hey.
I don't know what Mark told you, but I'll tell you one thing.
Three years ago, the body of a girl turned into a chimera was discovered.
Nina?
It is obvious that the method of killing is the same alchemy that uses a scar.
Thank you.
Thanks to this, I will be able to defeat him.
Meet me in the headquarters. I will send a request for you to be allowed to visit the first department of the library.
Sorry that I have a left hand.
Central, central, first, something is there.
Central library, first department.
Let her go.
Liar.
Sorry.
What?
The Fuhrer. What did the Fuhrer say?
You told this boy where the materials were hidden, right?
I don't understand what you're talking about.
Well, that's good.
This boy is approaching the Philosopher's Stone again.
But if there is something extra written in these documents, problems will arise.
The boy is smart. If he reads them, then what do you want from him?
Therefore, I would like to check in advance.
This is impossible.
After all, you will die here.
No.
What a nightmare.
I have already died once.
That's how it is.
So, rumors about you?
Review.
Tell me.
You told the boy where your documents were.
Well, I got it.
This man says, don't stop.
He boasts all the time about his family.
You can rest here.
Al!
Someone made a mistake at the previous station.
Not good.
We'll come back from the next station.
I can't wait.
Hey, hey!
Don't interfere!
Calm down, Edward Elric.
What should I do here?
If the Iron Armors suddenly started talking, then everyone would be very scared.
Did you notice, brother, that I'm not here?
I want to cry.
He couldn't have gone anywhere.
These are the armor.
Yes, how well you draw.
I got this skill from my ancestors.
Again about your supermanism.
Stop, it's dangerous.
Where are you going?
You don't know anything about us.
What?
Dr. Mark told me what happened in Ishvar.
Al!
Listen, have you seen the armor that was at the station?
Al!
Al!
Al!
Al!
Al!
Al!
Al!
Al!
Al!
Al!
Al!
Al!
Al!
Al!
Al!
Al!
Al!
Al!
Al!
Al!
Al!
Al!
Al!
Al!
Who took them?
Huge black ones.
Wait!
It hurts.
Hey, wait!
Wait!
Wait!
Wait!
Damn it!
If I had no problems with my arms and legs.
Al!
I'm fine.
Everything is going further and further from the station.
Excuse me.
Did you hear me?
I'm here.
In armor.
It doesn't hurt at all.
Now...
Listen.
Again.
Please, don't be surprised.
I...
The armor of the last model.
Yeah.
At the station.
It's in fashion now.
Talking armor.
Where's the switch?
It's annoying.
It's not here.
Then you'd better be quiet.
Where are you going?
To fight.
Fight?
Senior brother told me.
If I want to become like him,
I need to get one or two heads.
That's why I told him to finish this family,
which always comes to our territory.
If I can get at least one head,
no one will dare to treat me like a kid.
I'm recognized for the right hand of the senior brother.
I'll do it.
I'll do it.
So you're going to kill someone?
What a great armor.
Now let me...
Even if they shoot me with a gun,
I don't care.
Is that why you put on armor?
So it doesn't hurt?
Yes.
It won't hurt me.
So now I can fight as much as I want.
It should hurt anyway.
Why?
Are you defective?
My heart will hurt for sure.
That's nonsense.
It's better when your heart doesn't hurt, right?
Relax your hands.
What's that?
I am the cursed prosperity.
No, not like that.
I am the cursed armor.
If you become one with me,
neither your body nor your heart will hurt.
Never.
Never.
I'm sorry.
They live together with an old man like me.
It's hard for me without legs.
So she decided to help in her own way.
To make it easier for grandpa, right?
How could you notice her?
I can't give you the prosthesis.
But let me introduce you to the mechanic who made it.
She's rough, but her hands are golden.
Thank you for your care, but I don't need the prosthesis.
When will you get used to it?
Is it convenient?
Maybe, but I want my leg to stay like this.
The cut wounds on my leg,
when I was taken to the rear,
there was nothing left to computer the leg.
Front?
Were you a soldier?
What war?
In the North?
Or...
Are you really a welder?
I'm a welder.
I'm a welder.
I'm a welder.
I'm a welder.
I'm a welder.
I'm a welder.
At the front, everyone turns into other creatures.
They don't worry, doing any atrocities.
Perhaps to protect themselves, the heart is blindly closed from all emotions.
However, when the war ends, everything changes.
It is impossible to forget what I saw there, what I did there.
This wound reminds me of everything at once.
That's why...
That's why you don't need the prosthesis.
It's...
And not only that.
I lost my leg.
However, I acquired something more important.
Peace in the heart and life with grandchildren.
And then, when people lose a lot,
it seems to me that they acquire something in return.
That's right.
There are those who go to war, and they don't care about anything.
So to speak, the war-born.
They also lost something.
At first glance, this is not visible.
If you lost something, then you must have acquired something in return.
In alchemy, this is called an equal exchange.
Isn't it?
This can't be!
I lost my right hand and left leg.
And my younger brother lost his whole body.
To get it back, we desperately do everything possible.
To get everything back, this is our dream.
And in return, did we get anything?
We lost everything.
We lost everything!
Getting everything back is just a dream.
But if it comes true, what will you do next?
A dream that may come true is not a real dream.
Let it be so.
But we will still fulfill it.
Thank you for the treat.
Brother!
Grandpa, brother is back!
Exactly!
Al! Al!
Hey!
Al!
Al!
You stink like sheep.
I'm sorry.
Okay, when we get there, we'll think about it.
Al, the colonel said that four years ago he came to Rezenburg
because he accidentally read our letter.
He said so.
He said he was looking for his father.
And it seems to me that the colonel came to see his grandmother.
Major?
Yes?
I'm sorry.
Major?
I was worried.
I'm sorry.
What happened?
Listen, Major.
What I said recently...
I'm sorry.
Quickly!
If we are late for this train, we will have to wait until tomorrow afternoon.
Hey!
What are you doing?
Run!
This is a short-distance run that was passed down from generation to generation to my son.
Watch out!
