        <pre>There are no books here that would describe the Philosopher's Stone.
And the Stone of the Ruler turned out to be a fake.
So we're back with empty hands.
It's time to go back to the Central.
Ed, look.
The introduction to alchemy.
It was a long time ago.
Oh, right.
Hey.
I'm bored.
Wait a little bit more.
That's it. It's ready.
Look, Winry.
You said you were going to give me a present.
Now we're going to make a present for you.
The Stone of the Ruler
The Stone of the Ruler
Oh, Winry.
That was our first experience of alchemy.
When a person wants to get something,
he needs to sacrifice something.
So, if you want to get something,
you have to give something valuable in return.
Alchemy is called the law of equal exchange.
At that time, we believed
that it was the truth that ruled the world.
The Stone of the Ruler
The Stone of the Ruler
The Stone of the Ruler
The Stone of the Ruler
The Stone of the Ruler
Oh, Winry, you can't do that.
The boys tried so hard for you.
Of course, Edward and Alphonse did it all for you.
I'm sorry, Winry.
Many people learn from it.
But they throw it halfway.
And these kids have already become good alchemists.
I didn't think the kids knew anything about alchemy.
After all, they are the children of their father.
When did you learn from your father about alchemy?
How can he learn? He's not here.
It was in the book.
Do you understand such complicated things?
More or less.
Can't I?
Why not? It's great.
Now I'm going to brag to everyone.
Ah!
I'm going to brag to everyone.
I'm going to brag to everyone.
Ah!
I'm going to brag to everyone.
Ah!
Put the books back.
Put the books back.
When your father comes back, thank him.
Yes, yes.
And don't open the door.
I see.
Since my father left,
my mother began to often look into the distance.
However, after we began to study alchemy,
she began to smile much more often.
Mom will praise us, we thought.
And, competing with each other,
we went deeper into alchemy.
Mom!
Look!
Mom!
This is what Ed did.
And I only have this.
Edward Alphonse!
You are great!
Just like your father.
Will dad praise us for this?
Ah!
For sure, when he comes back.
I ran to Inri.
Ed!
Ed!
Do you hate dad?
I hate him?
I don't remember him very well.
When we talk about him,
mom has a strange expression on her face.
I don't like it.
I'm sorry.
Well, let's go to Inri.
What?
What is it?
I knew it.
My mom and dad died.
But...
Your parents are doctors.
Yes.
They went to war.
They died.
Edward!
Edward!
Edward!
Edward!
Edward!
Edward!
Edward!
Edward!
Edward!
Edward!
Edward!
Edward!
Inri!
I told you not to go back.
Don't cry.
Alchemy, your parents can...
Enough!
This is a forbidden subject!
Alchemy is not omnipotent.
That's why there are masters of self-defense like us.
Old witch.
Winry, I feel sorry for her.
Alchemy
Guys, what's wrong with you?
Edward, what's wrong?
You're a big boy already.
Don't cry.
Alchemy
Mom, I'm sorry we're late.
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
This disease has appeared not today and not yesterday.
It must be that it has been suffering from pain for more than a year.
Dear.
These are letters that he was sent.
If I write to everyone in response...
Maybe one of them will find out where dad is now and ask him to come back?
I don't want him to come back.
But you can't do anything.
You have to.
The money that your dad left.
I didn't touch it.
Take them and hold on to each other.
Mom, what are you talking about?
Will you create something for me, Edward?
Oh, here it is.
Here it is.
Make a bouquet.
He always made them...
...for me.
Mom was happy when she saw our alchemical experiments.
Because they reminded her of her dad.
We finally understood it.
Ed, I want to eat.
I'm cold.
Let's go home.
Al.
Come on.
Let's get her back.
One year later
Look.
This is his record.
It is not very clear...
It says about human transmutation.
If it can be figured out.
But it says here that human transmutation is prohibited.
Adults prohibited her because she does not succeed in everything.
But if we do everything right and mom will resurrect...
Everyone will be happy, and we will be able to live happily as before.
Maybe we should ask Dad first?
Mom died because of him. She waited for him for so long, and he didn't even show up at the funeral.
What he couldn't do, we'll do. We'll do!
We found ourselves a teacher, and we decided to study alchemy again.
And that day...
35 liters of water, 20 kilograms of carbon, 4 liters of milk, 1.5 kilograms of limestone,
800 grams of phosphorus, 250 grams of salt, 100 grams of silica, 80 grams of sulfur,
7.5 grams of toro, 5 grams of iron, 3 grams of creme.
The elements from which the body of an adult person consists, the formula of structuring.
It remains to breathe life into it. We will be able to summon her spirit and connect it with the body.
Ed, do you think we can do it?
What are you talking about, Al?
After all, alchemy is an equal exchange. We have gathered the components of the body.
However, what are we exchanging the soul for?
Give me your finger.
Here is all the information about her soul.
And now everything.
Let's start, Al.
I see, Borg, it's here.
Something is wrong.
Ed!
Ed!
Ed!
The last thing I saw was how the left leg of the brother disappeared.
And then...
Al, it's...
I'm sorry, Al.
Ed!
Ed, what's wrong with me?
And where is your hand?
I'm sorry, Al.
Ed!
Ed!
What's wrong with me?
And where is your hand?
My hand?
I only had a right hand.
I couldn't do anything.
I could only tie your soul to these armor.
Ed, what about mom?
It was not a human.
No.
But why?
Your theory was perfect.
It's not about theory.
We were wrong.
We were wrong.
Grandma!
Help!
Save Ed!
Al, is that you?
Huh?
What happened?
What happened to you?
You tried to bring your mom back.
I see.
It was a human transmutation.
I didn't have to see such a strong reaction before.
Hello.
A state alchemist?
What's going on here?
You see, the children are seriously injured.
I received this letter.
It's my brother.
He sent it to all his friends.
You know, your father, Hagenheim,
we've been looking for him for a long time.
We don't know where their father is.
We have a patient here.
Go away.
If he's still alive after the human transmutation,
he's even more interesting than his father.
Maybe he'll become a great state alchemist.
This boy didn't do anything.
Go away.
We're busy.
I'm a state alchemist,
Lieutenant Colonel Roy Mustang.
You can find me in the headquarters.
Good morning, Winry.
Aren't you sleeping?
I'm sorry.
I...
Mom.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Grandma.
We have money at home.
You're a fool.
You don't care about anything.
No, I don't.
Give me the money.
I want to visit the man who came to us, Roy,
and become a state alchemist.
I need arms and legs to feel free.
Did you hear everything then?
No, our teacher said
that if you become a state alchemist,
you can get access to secret documents
that the military has,
get funding,
do research freely.
They also say that their clock
increases the power of the alchemist.
Didn't your teacher say
that if the war starts,
they'll send you there?
And if they give an order,
then with the help of alchemy,
which should help people,
they will take lives.
In the war,
my son and his wife died.
Even in the army,
I don't care.
I have a job that I have to do.
Ed,
you're doing it again.
Hold on.
It's the best thing I've ever done.
Everything's fine.
Get out of here.
Unbelievable.
Adults shout from pain
when you attach your nerves
to the car armor.
This pain is a trifle
compared to what I've gone through.
Come on, Ed.
We haven't practiced for a long time.
To ignite the spirit,
you need to ignite the body.
That's what the teacher says.
Al, will you be able to handle this body?
It's better than your car armor.
Adults shout from pain
when you attach your nerves
to the car armor.
Brother,
are you seriously going to be a state alchemist?
I don't know yet
if I can do it or not.
Then I'll do it.
You can't.
Ed,
do you still want to resurrect your mother?
Didn't you say
that we made a mistake?
And now...
I'll be a state alchemist.
That's my decision.
And I'll find a way
to return your arm and leg.
Don't worry about it.
It's because of me.
If I stopped you,
you wouldn't have lost your leg
and your arm
when you tried to hold my soul.
What are you going to do
with such a body?
Ed...
I'll find a way
to return your body.
And mom?
I don't think it's worth it.
I think
there's nothing in this world
that can be exchangeable
for mom's soul.
And you...
I don't want to lose you.
That's why I'll go with you.
Why?
You're always lazy when I'm not around.
That's why.
I don't want
to lose you
one more time.
Even if it's your own body,
to return it,
you need a human transmutation.
If it doesn't work again,
maybe we'll disappear from this world.
Or maybe
retribution will be even worse.
But we don't have a way back.
That's why
when we went on the road,
we burned our house.
I don't want to lose you.
That's why.
I don't want to lose you.
That's why.
I don't want to lose you.
That's why.
I don't want to lose you.
That's why.
I don't want to lose you.
That's why.
I don't want to lose you.
That's why.
I don't want to lose you.
That's why.
I don't want to lose you.
That's why.
I don't want to lose you.
That's why.
I don't want to lose you.
That's why.
I don't want to lose you.
That's why.
I don't want to lose you.
That's why.
I don't want to lose you.
That's why.
I don't want to lose you.
That's why.
Steel Alchemist.
