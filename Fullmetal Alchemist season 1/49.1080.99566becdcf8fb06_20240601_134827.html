        <pre>Oh, hello, Dad!
Here she is, at home with Alia.
Here.
Do you want to open it?
Yes!
Thank you very much!
I congratulate you on your 10th birthday, Salim.
What is this place?
The house of this man.
This man? The one who makes the homunculus look for the Philosopher's Stone?
And not only that.
After all, he found us, gathered us and raised us.
He is deceiving you.
The homunculus wants to become human.
Only fools can be deceived.
And you?
Oh, I know.
This man wants the Philosopher's Stone only for himself.
And what about that?
It is enough for me to see how people suffer.
This is a very valuable body.
Look at it from the bottom.
You bitch!
How many people did you kill to make you a Philosopher's Stone?
Of the soldiers who invaded Lior, 7,000 people disappeared.
They did not die.
They are all here.
And all those who died in Ushvar a long time ago were gathered in the right hand of Shuram.
This is so cool!
There are thousands, tens of thousands of lives inside you.
We need to use them wisely.
I had to die.
Then.
And then.
And then.
Why am I still alive?
Ed.
Dad.
The Philosopher's Stone.
Those who have acquired it do not depend on the law of equal exchange.
And in order to get something, they should no longer give equal exchange.
We were looking for it and got it.
The Philosopher's Stone.
The Philosopher's Stone.
Ed.
The Philosopher's Stone.
The Philosopher's Stone.
Edward!
Where are you stuck?
Excuse me, is it here?
Yes, it probably is.
Show it to me again.
The father had long been looking for a way to create the Red Water and therefore came to the Central.
Here he found one place, the so-called Fifth Laboratory, and there he met one alchemist.
This man hinted to his father that for the creation of a philosophical stone from the Red Water,
he needed an essential element, human life.
And besides, he discovered where the real laboratory is located.
The Fifth Laboratory turned out to be just a piece of big mystery.
In fact, there was a huge testing ground for experiments on people.
It turns out that this is the place we were looking for.
I'll go alone.
But I don't know what for, and the alge is in danger.
Everything is fine. He's just a little lost.
Ed!
We brought this diary not so that you could create a philosophical stone.
I understand. I'm not going to create it at all. Believe me.
Come back! Come back alive!
Judging by the father's diary, if you go deeper and deeper under the ground of this temple of ancient religion,
then suddenly you come across another city located in the center.
According to the architectural style, the father assumed that this was an old city that was 400 years old.
There is a legend that says that the city, which disappeared overnight, was located in the center.
The father assumed that as a result of the experiment conducted by the alge,
the city was completely hidden underground.
The inhabitants of the whole city were all sacrificed to the philosophical stone.
But to destroy the whole city in order to deceive the rest and hide the disappearance of so many people?
Is there really a person who thought it over before?
Is there really a person who thought it over before?
Is there really a person who thought it over before?
There must be! You knew everything! Father!
You can't do it, Abzhorstva. Be patient.
Her body is very valuable to me.
It's wonderful. It's not surprising that this alge could fall in love with her.
They are his children.
But where is the passion?
And indeed, where?
Yes, we need to prepare the dress.
We need to meet the beautiful one.
Someone has come.
That's right. Quickly, Joan.
This guy!
Anger?
Where is he?
How?
You got me!
What does it mean?
Didn't he have to follow Edward?
Call him, please!
Where? I told him so!
Please! Give me the philosophical stone!
Anger. You will not be a good boy, you will not become a human.
There is no time! Mom! Mom will disappear!
Mom?
It's about laziness.
Laziness is not your mother at all.
Homunculi have no mothers.
Revive mom! Please!
Don't talk like you are a human.
Mom! Mom! Mom!
Anger!
Please!
What can you do with your body?
What power!
It is not surprising that Edward Elric has self-defense.
This is fun.
Indeed, the army looks at things.
Therefore, you do not notice who the real Fuhrer is.
It's not too late.
Go serve under my command.
Yes.
North, west, south.
We are ready to wage war with everyone.
The era of unification of the continent is coming.
I'm not interested.
Then die.
Your disciples will follow you soon.
What kind of god is this?
Bastards!
Izumi!
Ed!
He must be in the place where the brothers' diary was written.
They all believed in these children.
Believe in protecting children.
This is the job of adults.
As one man said to me.
Let's go.
Rosa!
Ed!
Finally you came.
Well?
Do you understand?
Do not touch such children.
Do not get used to it until it hurts.
What happened?
I think I understand something.
What are you talking about?
Before his death, he said,
what if everything is the other way around?
I could not understand anything then.
Do you understand now?
We thought that these homunculi were trying to make people make a philosophical stone.
But what if everything is the other way around?
When someone comes to create a stone, it is stopped,
and then destroyed by all the people who can be witnesses.
There are only rumors that those who approach the stone will die,
and people begin to be afraid of the philosophical stone.
And they try not to get close to it.
But then they seem to be doing well.
And yet, despite the fact that it is dangerous,
people continue to look for it, don't they?
I wonder what Edward and the others are doing.
I'm sure they are not fighting.
The lesson is inseparable from the battle.
I'm sure they are not fighting.
The lesson is inseparable from the battle.
But only God can teach such a lesson.
Rosa, why are you here?
I've been waiting for you all the time.
All the time.
Ed, I...
Rosa...
Rosa, didn't you bring Alla here?
What kind of place is this?
My child...
My child...
Would you dance with her?
After she ran here, she was looking for you all the time.
You are angry.
Lila, did you bring Rosa here?
Only old alchemists know about this city.
And Dante once told me.
I've never heard the truth.
Tell me, why was Dante killed?
She was killed by a homunculus named Greed.
I told you.
It's all a lie.
A lie?
The alchemical circle that remained in Dante's estate
shaped the movement of the homunculus.
And the bones of the man who turned out to be Greed.
That's why Greed couldn't raise Dante's hand.
What? Dante died?
Are you sure?
If that body was used only as a shell for the soul.
What are you trying to say?
And if there is a man who uses a philosophical stone
to move from one body to another
and has existed for several hundred years,
then you were imitating your death
and moved into Lila's body.
Isn't that right?
Ed, don't!
Ed!
That was risky.
When did you see the door, Lila?
You did the transmutation of the alchemical circle.
That was Dante's answer.
When did you understand, Edward Elric?
That means it's true.
I really liked that body.
And what does it count?
Well, I don't know, but it wasn't ten.
After all, every time you need to use a philosophical stone.
Did you kill all the inhabitants of this city
and create a philosophical stone?
Once upon a time, there was a country in the east
that disappeared one evening.
But the most interesting thing is that I didn't create it.
Guggenheim the Light.
You can't talk in that tone about your own father.
My father survived in the same way.
And for what?
Because we represent the value.
You secretly create a philosophical stone
using it only to prolong your life.
Do you think you can forgive that?
People can't use a philosophical stone.
That's why everyone who was unlucky
in creating a philosophical stone
was destroyed.
And there's a legend that everyone who gets close to it
will die.
Yes.
So that people don't get close to the philosophical stone.
But if, despite that, someone gets close to it,
we stop it in one step,
and then carefully use it.
After all, if we leave the philosophical stone
in the hands of a person,
we don't know what he will do with it.
All this I do so that stupid people
don't destroy the world.
Can I say that I live to protect the world?
So that people don't do stupid things?
Shut up!
You're a human too.
Not anymore.
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
What a pity.
And I wanted to go into her body
and enjoy the love of the son of Guggenheim.
Did you get the roses this time?
Yes.
I got the philosophical stone again.
Al, where is Al?
Passion!
What happened to passion?
Ask him about the feast.
Passion!
Passion! Passion!
She died.
Because of me.
Passion?
She died?
Yes.
I've already sealed her anger.
Passion!
Passion!
Passion!
Passion!
That's it!
That's it!
That's what I thought.
If you continue to connect only the soul,
it can't last forever.
Equal exchange.
Stupidity cannot be repeated endlessly.
Equal?
Do you still believe in these children's fairy tales?
These are not fairy tales.
This is the law of alchemy.
No, the law of the universe.
Didn't you say that?
If you want to get something,
you need to give something equal in return.
That's what they say with children.
Let's do everything fairly,
or it's not fair.
But there is no equal exchange.
That's not true!
If you want to get something,
you need to give something equal in return.
Then, on the contrary, if you give something,
you will definitely get something.
Exactly.
That's why people make an effort
to pay this price.
After all, after paying the same price,
everyone gets it in different ways.
That is...
There is an exam
for the title of a state alchemist.
In order to pass it,
people spend time on studying.
This is the price.
But only a few pass it.
You can of course make an effort
to study alchemy,
but due to different abilities,
the results are different.
Human lives are already unequal.
That's it!
Soon this baby will die!
Stop!
It's really easy to kill.
Does it mean that the baby was born to die?
He tries to live and pays his price,
but he only gets death.
On the one hand, there are those
who continue their lives by killing people.
No matter how hard you try to survive,
when the time of death comes,
you will die.
And if you compare with those
who, without making an effort,
live happily with money and power,
it turns out not too fair.
This world is cruel enough.
And at the same time,
you can say that it is beautiful.
Stop playing with words!
My baby!
Equal exchange is an excuse
that the weak comfort themselves with.
If you paid the price,
you could be happier.
This baby doesn't need an excuse!
What, father? What, son?
It hurts.
What is it?
What is happening?
My eyes!
Who is it?
What is it?
Edward!
What are you doing?
Edward!
Where are you going?
Edward!
Come on!
Wait!
Dad! Why are you here?
What is going on?
Dad?
Edward?
What are you talking about?
Where was my current?
What happened to me?
My face, my hands...
What is it?
Are you Edward, my son?
Of course! Who else?
Why are you here?
Well, you know...
Let's go! They're close!
Who are they?
