Episode 1
I'm listening.
This is Lieutenant Colonel Roy Mustang.
Edward Elric is calling for you.
He's calling for me?
Don't worry about it.
Yes, sir.
I'm about to board the train that departs at 9.20.
I see.
Wait a minute.
There's an earlier one.
Yes, there is.
But it seems to be leaving already.
Get on it.
Why?
No talking.
Al, run!
We'll see.
When a man wants to get something,
he needs to sacrifice something.
Thus, if you want to get something,
you must give something equal in return.
In alchemy, this is called the law of equal exchange.
At that time, we believed that this is the truth that rules the world.
The End
The End
The End
The End
I don't understand what kind of man this Lieutenant Colonel Mustang is.
He's so scary.
Oh, come on!
I'm not scared at all.
Look. Look.
Is there a weird duck there?
Weird?
Marine, you can't do this.
Sit down.
That's interesting.
He's in a hurry on the train.
Maybe he likes them very much.
We are the most ordinary people, don't worry.
Look, it looks like she liked you.
What do you think?
It's a stylish thing, isn't it?
Yeah.
Marina, enough.
They must be so tired.
Exactly.
It's good that the journey was successful, General Kukuro.
Although the situation in the East is considered unstable, everything is not so bad.
The bosses are always fun.
By the way, where is Major Hughes now?
Hughes?
He is in touch with Colonel Mustang about this operation.
Operation?
Okay, if that's the case.
Since my wife got pregnant, she has become even more beautiful.
How can I tell you, she's like an angel coming down ...
Huh?
It turned off again?
What a bad connection!
Some kind of disaster!
This is you, we have a disaster.
Somehow I'm not myself, I need to make a detour again.
Hello?
Oh-oh-oh.
Well, yes, yes, yes.
Of course.
And what should I do if the child is suddenly born tomorrow?
Hughes, I've heard your story 50 times already.
If you want to talk about this, call me, not me, but your wife.
Already!
I just called.
Then I'll be damned!
Excuse me for interfering.
Let me consult you.
Children are not born on the fifth month!
What?
What did you say?
I can't hear anything.
What kind of phone, huh?
Suspicious.
Enough, Hughes.
We have received confirmation.
The line is not listening.
Well, how is it there?
Did you notice anyone suspicious?
Yes.
More passengers entered the transfer station than expected,
if you count those who are in separate coupes.
What is it?
Found!
Found?
Found!
But a very suspicious type.
Describe.
In such huge armor.
Armor?
Don't worry about that.
Wasn't there a cockroach next to him?
Cockroaches?
Exactly.
There is.
And it's really small.
It's really so small that I can't see anything!
I...
I didn't say that.
Calm down.
Come on, everybody, hands up!
What are you?
What are you doing?
What are you?
Good afternoon, General Hakuro.
Hey, Hughes.
What's going on there?
Hughes?
Hey, contact Bardon.
We took the radio station.
It doesn't look like someone used it.
After all, it's them.
From the train to the next station, a call from General Hakuro.
Urgent.
Yes, sir.
It's me.
Lieutenant Colonel. Lieutenant Colonel Mustang.
This is Bart, the Blue Division of the Liberation Front.
We captured this train.
Your request?
Don't be a fool.
Today one of our people did not come into contact.
The one who was supposed to deliver you our statement.
I don't understand what you're talking about.
Okay.
Bring our leader, who is now in the eighth prison, to the central station.
Exchange for hostages.
I see.
But at the same time, you won't kill anyone.
Otherwise...
Are you sure?
If the general finds out that the statement is here,
all responsibility will be on you, Lieutenant Colonel.
Everything is fine.
The main thing is to settle this incident.
I've already done everything I need.
This Mustang...
He must have thought of something.
If he throws something out,
it's not only you, but all passengers and dead people.
Hey, you two!
You!
What are you doing?
What's next?
What if the others come to revenge?
Exactly.
If you didn't resist, you could get to the central station unharmed.
Exactly.
Yes.
Exactly.
What are we going to do?
What to do?
Are you okay?
Yes.
Yes.
I'm sorry.
We'll think of something.
Al, let's go.
Let's go.
Hey, guys!
What a shame.
And you are...
Just alchemists.
Oh, I see.
And I'm a farmer.
A soldier?
But you don't look like one.
There are reasons for that.
What?
The thing is that in the first car...
The first car?
Yes.
The first car?
Yes.
The first car?
Yes.
The first car?
Yes.
The first car?
Yes, the first car.
Is that a gang's goal?
So many people have come to that.
So al, I'll climb on the roof.
And you stay in the car with them.
I see.
What?
Oh, come here!
Something's wrong in the trailer.
Hey, don't shoot, please.
It hurts!
I wanted to say that it's dangerous to shoot.
The bullet can ricochet.
I got you!
Don't shoot!
Ouch!
Hey, Bart, we lost contact with the last wagons.
And what does it mean?
After all, they've set up something.
That's enough.
Give up and let the passengers go.
After all, everything has already gone wrong with you.
Peace!
I give orders here, General.
Check the whole train again.
And check the roof of the wagons, too.
Hey, are you okay?
You got out soon.
I'm Fuse.
And you're Edward Elric, aren't you?
Yes.
I heard about you from Lieutenant Colonel Mustang.
Lieutenant Colonel?
Yes.
And now I think you'll help me.
I've already checked everything here.
What?
Well?
What's there?
Who are you?
That's it!
Get him!
Are you okay?
What the...
Cool!
Hey, there!
Be careful, don't touch the tank!
I'm sorry!
Bart, this is the end!
There's a monster on the roof!
Bart, the guys are not answering.
They only managed to say something about the giant armor.
Calm down!
One, two, three...
Gentlemen of the criminal group, do you hear me?
What's that?
What the hell?
Hey, you!
Terrorists!
Let the hostages go!
Did Mustang send you?
You'll get in the way if I kill all the hostages one by one!
You seem to be decisive.
Well, then...
It's a water pipe.
Attention, hostages!
Please find the shelter!
What?
No!
Go!
Hello!
Don't move!
You're the boss here, aren't you?
What?
What's the problem?
Get out!
Before you cut off with the general, I'll finish you off!
Stop!
I see the same car armor.
The boy?
The military already uses children.
I'm sorry, boy, but no one uses me.
Listen, kid.
I used to serve in the army.
At that time, I wanted to have more perfect weapons.
However, I didn't like the army.
Well...
They must have been afraid that I would become too strong.
After the operation, they just threw me out.
That's why...
That's why I want to crush the army!
Do you understand?
Since you have such a hand, you must also want to become stronger than everyone else!
No, I don't understand.
And don't compare my hand with yours!
It's true.
Not bad.
I think I told you not to kill anyone.
And it seems that you obeyed my will.
Are you a Mustang?
Great!
It's just a scratch.
The damage is not as heavy as it seems.
My name is Roy Mustang.
My name is Lieutenant Colonel.
And I am a fiery alchemist.
Remember it well.
Is he a Mustang?
Lieutenant Colonel!
You knew everything from the very beginning and made us sit on this train!
Well, I can't say that I foresaw everything.
And by the way, I have good news for you.
The general, having learned about your feats, gave a special permission to participate in the exam to receive a license from the state alchemist.
Special permission?
Special permission?
You told us to come to the exam, so we ...
Do you think that children are admitted to an important military exam?
Well, how do you think?
It was a good idea to put you on this train.
To pass the exam or not, now it's up to you.
We have already decided!
We will pass the exam!
Pass the exam!
They used us like puppets.
But you can't do anything here.
We still can't do much.
Here they are! Here, here!
Marine!
Uncle!
Thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you!
Steel Alchemist!
The sixth episode is an exam on the name of a state alchemist.
Except for me, everyone thought that my brother could not pass this exam.
However, a miracle happened and the flowers bloomed.
The end
