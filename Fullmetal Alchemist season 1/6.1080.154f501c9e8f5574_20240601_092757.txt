Well, have you decided to pass the exam?
Of course.
And what?
Do I have to tell them off?
Hmm.
Okay.
I want you to prepare for it in the most favorable environment for this.
Alchemist of connecting life?
Sho Tucker.
The first person in biological alchemy.
It so happened that all the time before the exam, we lived in the house of Sho Tucker.
When a person wants to get something, he needs to sacrifice something.
Thus, if you want to get something, you must give something equal in return.
In alchemy, this is called the law of equal exchange.
At that time, we believed that this is the truth that rules the world.

The Resurrection of a Generation
Written and directed by
strangers
Two years ago, Taker managed to create the Emerald.
who speaks the human language and received the qualification of a state alchemist.
Speaking of chimera?
According to the report, the animal, composed of two genetically different living organisms,
in other words, chimera, understood human speech and spoke.
Cool.
Yeah.
Together with Tucker lives his four-year-old daughter.
Doesn't he have a wife?
It's here.
Wow, size!
Great.
What are you standing there for?
Come here.
Let's go.
Alexander, fool!
Oh, sorry.
Please forgive me.
Please.
You are that very Tucker.
I'm sorry when there is no female hand.
There is such a mess in the house.
Dad, the big brother has such funny clothes.
Isn't it hard for you?
No, I'm a village.
I think I still have the opportunity to tell you who they are.
Please, until then.
Nina, go play outside.
No.
Alexander is already sad.
Okay, see you soon.
At this age, you want to become a state alchemist?
Do not hesitate to contact me.
I will do everything in my power.
I would like to look at the alchemy that you created, Mr. Tucker.
Me too.
Unfortunately, she died soon after the synthesis.
No matter how it was, now the most important thing is to pass the exam.
In one day you will not prepare for such an exam.
This is the library.
It is at your disposal.
Great.
There are so many books that we have not seen.
These materials are just a drop in comparison to what is stored in the central state library.
If you pass the exam, you will be able to get a qualification that will bring you many times more knowledge.
That's how.
Ed, you need to put ...
This is Ed.
Ed, how are the classes going?
Well, how to say, we still don't know too much.
This exam is even difficult for adults who have passed special training.
But you are still so young and inexperienced.
You have to get used to it.

Thank you.
It looks delicious.

Yeah, that's it.
Can't sleep?
My head is full of what I learned today.

Listen, Ed.
What?
You will definitely pass the exam.
So you need to rest at least at night.
So you need to rest at least at night.
It hasn't been like this for a long time.
We just wanted to become
state alchemists.
We thought it would open
a new path for us.
Wow, it's already so late.
Wow, it's already so late.
Al, where are you?
Al, where are you?
Huh?
Is he playing?
Al!
Ed!
Look!
It's snowing!
It would be nice
to have our brothers
after the exam.

Ed, what are you drawing?
It's called an alchemical circle.

It's like fulfilling a wish.

Look.
Wow!
Wow!
It's great!
It's great!
You're working?
Major Hughes?
Yeah, I came for you.
Today is Ed's birthday.
Really?
How do you know?
How do you know?
I'm from the investigation department.
So, let's go.
My wife is waiting.
The little lady is coming with us.

It will be more fun to celebrate together!

Welcome!
This is my wife, Gliesya.
And the animal!
Yes.
Will you have a baby?
Soon.
The baby wants to get out faster.
He's already angry.
Really?
The baby wants to touch it.
Please, Nina.
Oh, it's moving!
Great!
So, who wants some more tea?
Thank you!
Gliesya!
Dear.
The baby.
The baby?
The baby is coming.
It can't be.
The baby wants to get out faster.
The doctor can't come.
There's a bear!
I'll get a doctor myself.
Wait for me!
Wait!
I'm sorry, guys!
Ma'am, I brought you hot water.
Thank you. Put it on the floor.
Anything else?
You'll probably need a lot of towels.
Towels? Got it.
The doctor is late.
It's snowing.
I can't take it anymore. I'm going to die.
Mrs. Glacy says she's going to die.
It can't be.
Is she really dead?
She's a fool. She lost her consciousness.
It's an alchemy to create a new life.
We need an equal replacement.
Roda, it's not an alchemy.
Thank God she's alive.
Mrs. Glacy, are you all right?
Damn it!
What am I supposed to do?
I can't help it.
Roda, the water is cold.
I see.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
What do you mean?
Why did the water boil?
I don't know. It's my energy.
I'm giving birth!
What can we do?
Where is Roda?
Roda!
Great! Great, Mrs. Glacy!
Thank you, guys.
Thank you very much.
We're fine.
You were right next to me.
It's just an alchemy.
But it's good for us.
Exactly.
Mother does amazing things.
An alchemy can take hundreds of years.
And nothing will come of it.
And our mother, too.
Al.
Ed, tell me,
when I was born,
was I as warm and soft as you?
Of course.
I see.
Since that day,
we've been doing more than before.
In order to get back
the bodies we were born with.
By the way, brother,
you were able to boil the water
without drawing an alchemical circle.
Well, the situation was extreme.
You did a great job, Ed.
I need to do my best, too.
Well, let me ask you a question.
Okay.
The exam is coming.
The exam is held like this.
It's a letter, an interview,
a practical work.
I don't know how many people take part,
but one or two pass it in a year.
That's all? That's not enough.
Yes.
What about the interview?
What are they doing there?
In my case, they were questions and answers.
Sometimes they even conduct
a medical examination.
What?
A medical examination?
So...
The practical exam is half and half.
Who brings the results of their research,
like me,
and who shows alchemical synthesis right there?
What are you going to do?
Well, well.
What are we going to do at the practical exam?
What to do if they send me
for a medical examination?
Everyone will know that the armor is empty.
Come on.
Lieutenant Colonel Mustang will come up with something.
Okay.
We didn't find a place
when the exam day finally came.
Well, well.
Well, well.
Let's start the first exam.
Let's start!
Well, well.
Damn it.
I didn't get to the last question.
Actually, I did everything.
But then there's the interview.
It can't be.
The younger brother also passed.
Any problems with him?
The interview means...
Alexander!
What?
I don't understand why.
Why shouldn't I go through the interview?
If you want to hide the past
and move forward,
there is no other way.
But I, together with my brother...
Why not, Al?
What?
Do you remember what Grandma Pinak said?
After all, the title of a state alchemist
is such a thing
that they can send it to war.
Maybe we'll have to kill people
with their alchemy,
although it should do good to people.
If you pass the exam,
you'll become an army dog.
But...
It's enough if only I become
a state alchemist.
I will definitely become one
and be able to fulfill your dream.
Ed...
The Golden Triangle?
Why doesn't it fall in such a form?
Sit down.
If you are a real alchemist,
the chair will not reject you.
An alchemist should never be afraid.
Good.
The question is,
why did you decide to pass the exam?
It's...
It's...
I made a promise.
To my only relative,
I promised to become a state alchemist.
Alla...
Do you think we chose the right path?
I don't know.
But I'm sure of one thing.
I want to touch you one more time.
It's funny.
We are always close,
and the feeling of touch
is always with us.
I'm sure of one thing.
We are always close,
and the feeling of touch

I'm sure of one thing.
The morning of the practical exam has come.
I'm going.
Brother!
Nina.
Brother, here...
Amulet of fulfilling wishes!
Thank you, Nina.
All materials on this territory are at your disposal.
You can transform them at your discretion.
At my discretion?
What should I do to pass the exam?
Impressive. However, he spent all his energy on it.
Wow!
I am the next one.
Wood and water.
How is our brother?
He will be fine. He has your amulet.
Impressive.
He made a hydrogen from wood and water.
Danger!
What?
No alchemical circle.
That young alchemist. Interesting.
How beautiful!
Al. I will not doubt anymore. I will run.
Looking only forward.
If I end up in a dead end, only then I will decide.
Someday I will definitely return your real body to you.
Yes. When we return your body,
I will return your amulet.
Yes. When we return your body...
Yes. When we return your body...
To be continued...
To be continued...
Nina.
