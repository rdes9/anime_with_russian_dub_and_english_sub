I beg your pardon for calling you here.
This is from Mr. Edward Elric.
A statement?
He asks that his expenses for hospitalization, treatment
and food in the hospital be paid by the Eastern headquarters.
For snacks.
For snacks.
For books.
And a lot of cheques from the toy store.
Where are they?
They went on a journey to achieve their goal.
I think that in the near future they will contact you, so now...
I'm asking where they went.
Colonel, come here.
Are the Elric brothers here?
They're not here.
Where are they?
I... I'm not...
Here.
Wow, well done. Let's go.
When a person wants to get something, he needs to sacrifice something.
Thus, if you want to get something, you must give something equal in return.
In alchemy, this is called the law of equal exchange.
At that time, we believed that this was the truth that ruled the world.
THE END
THE END
THE END
Finally, we arrived in Rush Valley.
Oh, what a beauty!
This is a ring, a new model, Remis's workshop.
Who would have thought that this could be seen in this city?
Buy me, buy me.
Okay, dear.
Oh, what a beauty!
This is a model of the year 2011.
I didn't think that there would be a day when I would see her with my own eyes.
What a thing!
Give it to me.
Not at all.
Why is that?
Because a man's dream is a man's dream.
Girls don't need it.
Oh, what a beauty!
This is a ring, a new model, Remis's workshop.
Who would have thought that this could be seen in this city?
Buy me, buy me.
Oh, what a beauty!
Huh?
What do we have here?
It's a bad place.
Hey, man, I'd like to have the strongest thing I have.
I have a lot of money, I want to get rid of them all at once.
Hey, I'm a client.
Oh, what a thing!
It looks good.
Give it to me.
Not at all.
My car is only for those who need it.
What is it?
I'm a client.
And you can do without it.
What is it, old man?
Who needs your car?
You're a bad man.
Attention, attention!
Only the armwrestling tournament has just started.
The total number of participants is 10,000.
And if the champion wins, take the whole bank.
Clean up the mess!
Excuse me.
Okay, I'll try.
Come on, brother, are you interested?
Ready?
Attention!
Start!
No!
Well done!
Attention!
Start!
Brother, was that it?
Attention!
Start!
What are you doing?
Girl, are you sure you can fight with such a slow machine?
Hey, it's useless.
It's the car armor of that stinky old man.
Ready?
Attention!
Start!
No!
What a pity!
Do you want me to introduce you to a good mechanic?
So, who is the next candidate?
Hey!
There, brother, you look strong.
What about one fight?
Me?
No, I won't.
That's it.
Then that one.
No, it's not serious to invite this little one here.
So small!
Who is it here?
Goroshin!
You are quite energetic for Goroshin.
Although this armor is quite bad.
Al, let go, Ed.
Okay.
Ed!
Don't you dare to lose!
Then let's start.
Attention!
Start!
Sorry.
Today is the old man's holiday.
Well done!
Five hundred and ten thousand!
With this I can buy all the details I wanted!
But I was really glad that...
What?
Nothing.
You again?
You did a good job.
If you don't want any problems, just shut up and give me the money.
Why?
We honestly won.
Don't you know that this little one was cheating?
What?
You used alchemy yourself.
You used it too.
Ed, did you use alchemy?
Yeah.
Did you know about it?
Yeah.
I see.
Ed?
Yeah.
Winrich!
It hurts!
It hurts!
What did they find on you?
Ed!
Ed, you're a fool!
Colonel.
I brought Major Armstrong.
We have several suspects in the murder of Brigadier General Hughes.
Then why don't you arrest them immediately?
It's just a version of who they are and where they are now.
Tell me in detail.
I can't.
This is the order of the senior colonel.
I have no right.
Okay.
You're free.
Yes, sir.
That's weird.
No.
There are several suspects in the murder.
Since he didn't follow the colonel's order,
it means someone higher than me has forbidden the Major to speak.
Besides, as the junior Lieutenant Ross said,
the Elric brothers, without reporting to me,
went on a journey on their own.
It means that the higher command is connected with the Philosopher's Stone.
Really?
If so,
are all ends in vain again?
Where are you now, Winry?
It was not good to use alchemy.
They started to cheat first.
Yes, but ...
Did you hurt your hand?
I saw an armwrestling tournament.
Here it is.
Can I sit down?
Yes.
What about your legs?
Do you have a motorbike too?
Yes.
What about your legs?
Yes.
What about your legs?
Yes.
What about your legs?
Do you have a motorbike too?
Yes.
How did you know?
I'm a motorbike mechanic.
Did you hurt your hand?
Yes.
Show me.
Great!
It's just made of high quality.
And there is nothing extra in the design.
There was a big load on the suspension.
It seems that the cylinder is bent.
Did you understand it right away?
The person who did it has golden hands.
You need to show it to him as soon as possible.
Yes, of course.
But ...
Why did you install the motor armor?
What?
The train is broken.
And this man?
Yes.
He took me to him and made my hand and legs.
Dominic.
Then you need him to fix it himself.
Yes, but ...
Why don't you ask him?
I don't want to say that I lost the tournament.
I wanted ...
I wanted to prove that his motor armor is great.
It's better.
But ...
What?
So you need to prove that the motor armor is great, right?
Yes, but how?
If the state alchemist who uses the motor armor loses to you,
it will prove that your motor armor is great.
It's possible, but ...
Put it on me.
Yes.
Nini.
What are you doing there?
Yes, Dominic.
I'm sorry to bother you.
I'm a motor armor mechanic from Rezimburg.
My name is Winry Rogbel.
Rezimburg Rogbel?
Rogbel?
You're from Pinac, Rezimburg.
From their memories, they are shaking.
Do you know my grandmother?
No, no, not at all.
What happened to your hand?
Nothing special.
As you know.
What nonsense?
Where did this Winry go?
Maybe she slept on the street?
I barely found you.
Nonsense.
We were looking for you yesterday.
I'm sorry.
I was too angry at you yesterday.
Good morning.
We saw you at the wrestling tournament.
This is Paninja.
I stopped by her house yesterday.
Really?
Listen.
What?
Can you show us your silver watch?
Why?
Please.
What the...
Here.
I'll take it.
What the hell?
Get out of the way.
You'll win if you take her watch
before she takes it to the club.
Mr. Karatysh, come here.
Hey, you.
Winry.
Don't be in a hurry.
Mr. Alchemist.
Brother.
Winry.
Why all this?
I want to say
that the car armor is great.
Stop.
Stop.
Wait.
Wait.
You're trying so hard.
I'm not.
Like a cat.
Why don't you use alchemy?
Shut up.
Got you.
Now give me back
my silver watch.
Try this.
One and a half Dima's musket.
I overdid it a little bit.
Brother.
I hope it's okay.
Okay.
Lombard.
Got you.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
It hurts.
How do you feel?
Just a little bit more.
I don't know
what you feel.
I can't lose
this car armor.
I wanted to prove to Domenico that he has a wonderful auto armor, she is really wonderful
here is a fool daughter hello you shouldn't have done this but listen to the auto armor
this is not just a mechanism these are your hands and legs only yours
and remember that you grew up a daughter who would not understand this
making an auto armor you think about who it is and it becomes a part of the body
I remembered that I was so happy when I was able to get up on both feet again
I ask you colonel please find the criminal who killed Brigadier General
I will do anything for this investigation the death of Brigadier General
hughes during the investigation has already been stopped that is why I ask you colonel
well, as usual, everything is in work mustang glad to see you general hakuro before me
rumors of your transfer to the central have reached, however, everything may still happen differently if you
support me, I will serve you with faith and truth, I hope for your further leadership, praise the
I will be raised, you will stay with me, you know,
well, then I say goodbye to this good hello winry
and you sleep no I recently noticed you are not strange a little bit of an adult of course
means you need to prepare a new hand and leg maybe you will come back with me in rosenberg well I do not know
not now I will not go why
you are not satisfied with the car armor I try so much I will learn a lot so that
nothing bothers you so listen to winry we still want to return our
past, we must do it
for it
Wow!
But it seems like we'll meet again in this city
The reason I believe in love is that I can't lose to myself
Until the day my dream comes true
I'll look at the stars with a smile and pray for you
Because I'm here
I want to be in the sky for you
Even sadness is wrapped around
Whenever I look up, I see that I'm not alone
As if I could feel it from afar
As if I could find a place to return
