        <pre>The stone is red like blood itself.
People with blessing call it a philosophical stone.
Is it really true?
Ed.
We've been searching for so long, and all we've found is this way.
Here, living people are the raw material for a philosophical stone.
And there are so many more!
When a person wants to get something, he needs to sacrifice something.
So, if you want to get something, you need to replace something equal.
In alchemy, this is called the law of equal exchange.
At that time, we believed that this is the truth that rules the world.
Ed.

There's no time like stopping here.
Major, wait.
Major Armstrong!
What?
They are...
They are very tired.
It's better not to bother them.
What? Tired?
Then I'll invite them for dinner.
Let's eat something to cheer them up.
No, no!
I think they are both resting now.
I can tell them, Major, that you came in.
That's it.
Well, if they sleep, you can't do anything.
Oh...
It seems that God hates people who break taboos.
I've been looking for him for a long time.
I tried to reach him with my hand,
but he slipped away.
And so, time after time.
And when we found him,
we were shocked.
Are we going to be like this all our lives?
Ed!
I thought I would find the Philosopher's Stone,
and my dream would come true.
We will definitely find him.
We are trying so hard.
When you were called an army dog,
when they said you sold your soul for privileges,
you never gave up.
So...
So we will definitely find him.
Ed?
Let's do it again.
From the very beginning.
That's enough.
Maybe we got it wrong.
I told you, that's enough.
But if we keep going like this,
we will definitely find him.
We will definitely find him.
We will definitely find him.
We will definitely find him.
We will definitely find him.
We will definitely find him.
That's enough.
But if we read it again,
maybe we will find something new.
I will help you.
Let's try it.
I told you, that's enough.
Brother!
What happened?
I'm sorry.
I don't want it anymore.
Don't be so sad.
I don't want it anymore.
I can't take it anymore.
Can you take it?
I don't want to see it anymore.
Brother!
So what? Is this the end?
Won't you feel sorry for having stopped now?
It turns out that it's so easy to refuse
because you've been looking for it and found it.
You don't know anything.
Stop arguing as if you know everything.
I know.
I know that you are looking for a Philosopher's Stone
and that it is used to make the victims of the living people.
I understand it's bad, but I'm listening.
If you've heard, you should understand.
What else is not clear?
Just leave us alone.
After all, you are looking for a child.
It's scary, isn't it?
To be left without an answer.
You don't want to admit
that so much has been done for nothing.
I'm wrong.
I'm sorry.
I'm wrong.
Well, even if it's in vain.
But understand, even just getting an answer
is already an achievement.
What you've been doing is a very difficult problem.
Maybe you should put a little more effort, Mr. Elric.
Maybe so.
If we stop halfway, the answer to this will not change.
Ed!
We've gone too far.
Can we stop halfway?
We have to get to the end and see the result.
Yes!
Dr. Mark's research is perfect in theory,
but he didn't get to create the perfect Philosopher's Stone.
Perhaps there are other ways.
Yes.
I want to test the truth of Dr. Mark's theory with my own eyes.
Truth?
The truth hides behind the truth.
Hides.
Hides.
The truth.
Here it is!
There's another clue.
According to this paper,
to create the Philosopher's Stone,
we need quite a lot of equipment.
At the moment, the army has four alchemical laboratories.
Dr. Mark was assigned to the third.
Here.
I went around all the laboratories in the city.
It doesn't look like they were conducting serious research somewhere.
And this?
It used to be the fifth laboratory,
but it was closed and now it's abandoned.
The building can collapse at any moment,
so entry to the territory is prohibited.
It's there.
Look.
There's a prison nearby.
The second prison of the Central.
And what does it have to do with it?
The material for the Philosopher's Stone.
People.
Research should be carried out where it's easiest to find this material.
A prisoner?
It can't be.
It's quite logical to use it as the material
used to sentence prisoners to death.
Who's responsible for this prison?
Brigadier General Basque Grant.
A few days ago, he was killed by a scar.
Ed?
You won't do anything.
Let's go there and check the place.
Yes.
Wait.
Now the work for the adults begins.
Besides, the scar is still hunting for you.
It's too dangerous to go outside.
Yes, but...
We'll check the fifth laboratory ourselves.
And you stay here.
As soon as new information appears, I'll let you know.
Please.
Brother.
Well, what can I do?
Okay, do it.
I'm counting on you.
Yes.
You can rely on us.
THE FIFTH LIST
Lieutenant Colonel Hughes.
I've finished recording case number 32-36.
Oh, great.
Excuse me, wait a minute.
Then, please, the next case, number 9572.
It needs to be done quickly.
The materials will be needed tomorrow.
I see.
What's going on?
Are you tired?
No, not really.
Look, this time it's a special photo in the bathroom.
Well, how is it?
It's so cute.
You're so far away from it.
It makes you look like you're tired.
Right?
Well, how is it?
Yes, I told you, I told you.
Hello, Lieutenant Colonel.
Lieutenant Colonel, what's going on?
Oh, yes.
The body of the scar.
We haven't found it yet.
I see.
Please, send our people to the central library for security.
What?
I was looking for a real treasure.
So I owe it to Ed.
Security alarm?
Isn't it too serious?
Isn't it too serious a measure for a building that is not used?
The further, the more suspicious.
Okay, let's go to the other side.
Okay.
How strange.
However, in such cases, I am glad that we have unusual arms and legs.
Yes, that's right.
Let's go.
The entrance is also securely closed.
Ed, look.
It stretches deep.
Al, wait for me here.
Can you handle it alone?
I don't know, but you can't get through here with your huge body.
Okay, I'm going.
You can think, I became so big at will.
This is the junior lieutenant Maria Ross.
Please connect with Major Armstrong.
What happened, junior lieutenant?
Major, I need to talk to you.
Okay.
Quickly contact the headquarters and call for reinforcements.
Yes, sir.
I don't need you.
Where is the rest of the alchemist?
Two are here, the rest are on the other side.
Where is Edward?
So the rest now knows it.
Shran, stop!
Junior lieutenant!
Where is Edward and Al?
Look at this.
These are the children.
I cleaned up the mess carefully.
Now there is no one there who would know the extra.
That's how it is.
Thanks for the job, envy.
Everything is going smoothly here too.
It seems that the steel rat sniffed about the laboratory.
Shouldn't we figure it out until the military found out about everything?
When you kill, let me try.
Wait.
Perhaps this boy will fulfill our desire.
I don't care.
The main thing is that he doesn't interfere with us.
Although I doubt that the child will get out of there.
I told them not to touch these two, but I'm worried.
After all, they are such idiots.
In the extreme case, we will have to finish there with everyone.
I know.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Damn it, it's narrower than I thought.
A person of normal height will not get through here.
It's good that you're little.
This is bad.
The light is on.
The light is on, so it's not being used at the moment.
Bingo!
What the...
What is this?
Ah...
They really don't want to let anyone in here, since they made me do it.
But I'm gonna get through anyway!
Ah!
Ah!
Hey, didn't you have an order not to touch them?
I don't know anything.
And I won't calm down until I'm all over the place.
Wait!
There are two of us, and two of us.
I'll give you everything you need.
Ah, damn it!
Oh, it's good that I'm so small.
Well, that's it! I'm sick of it!
What does that mean? Come in.
Come in.
Welcome!
You are expected at the shower reception.
It doesn't look like a shower reception.
I have the security of this place.
Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Number 48.
Number 48?
I am very glad that in some time I will be able to make peace with my worthy rivals.
Our fate has brought us together.
So, boy, don't hold a grudge against me.
You'd better not hold a grudge against me, boy!
Who will beat you up!
Something is holding him back.
What is he doing?
How nice!
So huge, so mobile.
It's even better.
Who are you?
You have to answer when they ask who you are.
My name is Number 66.
It was a nickname associated with my work.
Number 66?
There is a real name, too.
But you'll put it on your pants when you hear it.
I'll call you before I cut you into pieces.
You said you were going to beat me up.
Before I cut you into pieces.
You said you were going to protect this place.
I have one question for you.
If you beat me up, I'll tell you everything I want.
Come on!
Come on!
Oh, my God!
Oh!
Scorch of Mastery!
Scorch of Mastery!
One sword of mine will cut you into pieces!
It's not funny!
If Winry breaks me again, he'll kill me!
What?
Oh, my God!
What's that sound?
What?
It's...
It's the same as Kal.
Armors instead of body.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
These memories are not a lie.
I am a human.
