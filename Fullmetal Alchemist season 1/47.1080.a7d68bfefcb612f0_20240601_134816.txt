Well, hello, Alphonse. Did it hurt? Don't worry, everything will be fine. Do you remember?
As in childhood.
Mom?
Yes.
Alphonse!
Mom?
Mom?
Mom?
Mom?
Mom?
Mom!
Mom?
Mom!
Mom, mom!
Mom!
Those who have acquired it do not depend on the law of equal exchange.
And in order to get something, they should no longer give equal exchange.
We were looking for it and got it.
The only thing I want to spit out is the proof of existence.
My future, which I should have grasped, is full of dignity and freedom.
The only thing I want to erase is my distorted existence.
Because I see my own limits there.
My self-contained emotions are not found in the calendar of the past.
Erase it! Relight it!
This is a stupid illusion!
The forgotten existence!
Extinguish it! Relight it!
Even your imagination!
CINEMA
THE END
Let me try again...
Al, please...
Please...
You've played your part, Taker.
Ed?
Homunculus...
Get away from Al!
Ed, but that's...
Yeah, that's not our mom.
I got caught first too.
I understand everything, but...
No matter how much she looks like her, she doesn't have a soul.
Why are you like this, Edward?
Please, Al!
Taker?
Did you call out one Al on purpose?
Equal exchange.
After we used the Philosopher's Stone, that's what happened.
Taker, you're screwed.
Bastard!
There are too many of those who need to shake their souls!
If I don't start recording, I'll definitely forget!
Enough!
Let's go with me now.
He can't, Edward.
Are you going to give him his former form?
Or are you planning to use Al's body with that man?
Al, step back!
Get out of the way!
It hurts, Edward.
I know it myself.
Why won't you just die?
Don't run away, Ed.
That's...
That's an alchemical circle.
It was drawn in Dante's house when I killed Greed.
With the help of it, the homunculi will be sealed.
You're so smart.
But one of them isn't enough.
I understand.
The only weak point of the homunculi is the part of the body of the person who was trying to survive with the help of human transmutation.
Ed, what's that?
The remains of the person whose transmutation gave birth to this homunculi.
Mom...
Ed, you...
You didn't tell me anything about your mother's grave?
I was alone enough.
It's useless, Lenya.
The alchemical circle won't disappear from this.
I drew it with my own hands.
Thank you, Greed.
I didn't do it because of you.
Why are you betraying that man?
Lenya, you really don't remember anything?
What are you talking about?
And I...
...remembered.
But not much.
We shouldn't have any memories.
However, the feelings of the alchemist who was transmuting...
...were so strong...
...that it seems that the memories of the deceased...
...were imprinted in me.
That's why I remember something.
I was a woman from Ishvar.
Wait.
If the memories of what happened before your birth...
...could come back to you...
Stop it, Greed!
...then you would see hell.
Al, what are you doing?
Ed, you can't do this to your mother's body.
Al, if we don't defeat them...
...they will always hunt for you.
However, since it stopped her...
...it means it's true.
She was born exactly then.
Al, she's a homunculus.
Homunculus are born as a result of an unsuccessful transmutation of a person.
Let them have no soul.
I beg you, Al.
But we created her.
That's right. We have to kill her.
It's impossible.
Al, then I'll do it.
Go pick up the remains, baby.
She can still be sealed.
With this, you're going to torture your mother.
Greed?
Mother?
She's not your mother.
We'll see.
I'm going to take everything from you.
She's not my mother.
Then I'll take it for myself.
Give it to me.
What are you doing to my mother?
Mother?
He needed a mother.
So he found this replacement for himself.
I told you to move!
Al!
Al!
Al!
Al!
Al!
Al!
Al!
Al!
Al!
I told you to stop!
Now let's go.
Al!
I'll take care of the anger.
You're not at the age
when they almost run to your mother.
It's stupid.
I'll be reborn.
Only as many times as you need
of the red stones.
Therefore,
until they run out,
I'll kill you
as many times as I need.
I'll...
I'll become...
I'll become...
And what will it give you?
Well...
If so...
Why did I come here?
You were mistaken from the beginning.
You forgot
that I can use alchemy.
Al!
Al!
Al!
I'm sorry.
My body is no longer subordinate to me.
If you touch me,
the reaction can begin.
It seems so.
So give up.
Mom!
Understand, Al.
She is not our mother.
Mom would not have said that
and would not have used you as a shield.
She would not have attacked me.
Ed!
If you can not touch your brother,
then you want to use the circle.
I will not give you time to draw it.
Ed!
I'll make it.
Al!
Al!
Al!
Al!
Al!
Al!
Al!
Al!
Everything turned out as you wanted.
To become a human
and die.
And die.
That's how
I
wanted to die.
If I become a human,
I'll just die?
Then what is
a real human?
You can not answer, even a human!
Mom!
Yes!
I have to protect mom.
Al, forgive me.
No.
You forgive me.
Yes.
Passion.
That night...
That night I
saw you.
Edward.
Edward.
Eat it.
They are his children.
I knew that this would happen.
Edward.
Now I can finally see her.
You look the same.
What is it?
There were
two children.
Two.
And a husband.
We were happy.
But very
sad.
You will become a human, you will understand.
A human.
I will help you.
We will find the Philosopher's Stone.
What if
leave her next to you?
I have the documents of one
woman. I used them in the
Vyshvar business. So we can
arrange everything.
Right. If you come back
home with her, your dear wife
can be jealous.
Lene.
From today
your name is Lene.
She makes
heat, vibrations
and molecules.
Edward.
Stop pretending to be my mom.
You don't remember anything about her.
I have memories.
Passion was right.
I have memory.
Maybe
it's only your thoughts about mom
that were burned in me.
Lies. Then this...
That's why I can do it.
I have
memories.
Memories
about how I was
your mom.
But your mom
is dead.
Dead.
And I am not a human.
Who am I?
I will kill you.
Then I can prove
that I am not a human.
I will kill you.
Then I can prove
that I am not your mom.
If you don't disappear,
these memories
will torment me.
Even though I am not your mom.
I am like a mother.
I can love you.
But I must hate
those who
created me like this.
Ed!
What should we do?
This is just the form
that our sin took.
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
I am not your mom at all.
And I am not going to
hold you in my arms.
Ed!
Mom!
I turned my
self-defense into sodium.
He reacted with water
and it happened. Mom! Mom!
Enough! Mom! She was not
anyone's mom! Mom!
Mom is dead!
Enough! Mom!
Mom!
No matter what you do,
I will not die.
Mom! Mom!
Get away from us, Gnev.
Mom, I want to be with you.
Did he
grow up with
another homunculus?
Gnev,
why?
He absorbed
the remains of my mother
that I brought here.
Since you have grown up,
you probably won't be able to move.
I will turn the substance
into another substance.
It's impossible, Ed!
You won't be able to transmute
a human body!
I understood something during the fight with greed.
I was able to change
its molecular structure.
Unlike Kimble,
who could only change
a single component,
I can transform the whole body.
Because
homunculi
are not people.
Mom!
What did you do?
What did you do to mom?
Get away!
Get away!
Mom!
I turned
all the water molecules
into ethanol.
It will disappear soon.
