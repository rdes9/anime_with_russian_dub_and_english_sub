        <pre>My end is near, it's true. But so is yours.
You may hide your decaying body under your clothes,
but this smell will not deceive me.
Gogenheim.
Well, yes, right.
We haven't seen each other for several centuries.
And we can talk calmly.
Besides, I still haven't tried my new body.
I'm sorry, but I have a wife.
Oh, yes, I also had a husband.
A lot, a lot, a lot of husbands.
And if I didn't make a replacement,
then the secret of my body,
which is getting too old, would become known.
Trisha was the first woman I loved.
And the last.
That's how it is.
And when 400 years ago we just met,
didn't you whisper to me about love?
Then I was still young and inexperienced.
It seems to me that memory is leading me.
Well, that's enough.
That day, 400 years ago,
we finally achieved our goal.
Using in life those who fled the hunt for witches
and those who waited for death from the plague,
we repeated our experiences over and over again.
And finally we created the Philosopher's Stone.
However, after the end of the transmutation,
you were on the verge of death.
And I, using the Philosopher's Stone,
attached your soul to the body of another person.
That's how we got eternal life.
That is, you, using the Philosopher's Stone,
have already many times transferred your soul to other bodies.
Yes, that's right.
Lies.
You sent us in search of the one who could create the Philosopher's Stone.
Since Hagenheim's light disappeared,
it became a necessity for me.
Why?
Why did you leave me then?
Dante,
eternal life does not exist.
The Philosopher's Stone,
those who acquired it,
does not depend on the law of equal exchange.
And in order to get something,
they should no longer give equal exchange.
We were looking for it
and got it.
What I want to give back
to such victims
is proof of most of my existence.
The future I have
has lost its 아니에요,
작 Las observantes,
since I became twice stronger.
By the terriblebt of Shamisen,
who was not Gy hooks.
I don't need it,
they were used byras.
I don't need their bondage,
they were used in order to start.
We are friends.
I want to erase the distorted image
Because I see my limits there
In my self-conscious, emotional window
I can't find the calendar of the four of us
I want to erase the distorted image
Because I see my limits there
In my self-conscious, emotional window
In my self-conscious, emotional window
In my self-conscious, emotional window
In my self-conscious, emotional window
Who are you?
Hurry up and pick up the phone!
Hello!
Brothers and sisters at home!
Old man?
Yeah!
He sounded like an old man with a strange voice!
Old man?
He asked you to tell him that he wants to meet you, no matter what!
He said that it doesn't matter when you come back!
And this man was crying!
What?
You know that!
No, no!
It looks delicious!
Ed will be happy!
Oh, there he is!
Ed!
What happened?
What happened to your clothes?
Ed!
Oh, I was walking around here!
I left traces as if we had gone to the north!
I did it so that they would see me!
And on the way home I fell!
I should have gone too!
And what would we do if you were found by the homunculus?
Well, what happened?
There was just some strange phone call!
Some stranger!
Maybe it was just the police sniffing about us?
That's right!
Food!
I was the one who recommended Edward Elric to the state alchemist!
And he brought us such a disgrace!
Do you have any information that this boy is connected to the rebellion in Leor?
Judging by the reports, a year ago in Leor, he exposed the preacher of the summer teaching,
who used alchemy for criminal purposes.
However, in reality, after this incident, the preacher remained intact and harmless,
and as a result, he forced us to bring the troops to Leor.
However, this measure subsequently led to a riot among the population.
Are you criticizing my tactics?
Wait, gentlemen.
Taking into account the former merits of Colonel Mustang,
we should not forget that we have an outstanding officer of the army.
However, I do not understand why you stopped looking for the Elric brothers.
I assumed that the Elric brothers would return to their native city,
so I set up a trap there.
But apparently they headed north.
North? Is it really a drama?
Now I understand. So they are connected to this wild tribe.
Major Armstrong's detachment continues their search in the north.
However, more important information reached me, and therefore I returned.
Important information?
Then I would ask everyone to leave.
Do not. This is about your secretary Juliet Douglas.
And what is this information?
At the moment she is on vacation.
What is wrong with her?
There have been serious questions in connection with her service list.
In addition, there is a possibility that she is involved in the murder of Brigadier General Hughes.
How confident are you in this?
Aqui!
You really screwed up!
But those who call themselves homunculi
have been sacrificing themselves for a long time
to create the Philosopher's Stone.
And if that's the case,
then I'm not sure
if it's a good thing
or a bad thing.
I don't know,
but I think
it's a good thing.
I think it's a good thing.
I think it's a good thing.
I think it's a good thing.
I think it's a good thing.
And if that's the case,
then there's a chance
that the war in Ishwar was started
to create the same Philosopher's Stone.
Did they start the war on purpose?
What are people looking for
in the Philosopher's Stone for?
Wealth,
fame,
power,
eternal life,
despair.
When people around you die,
when people
suffer from despair,
they look for the Philosopher's Stone
as their last hope.
In extreme situations,
including at war,
the morale that doesn't let us
sacrifice human life disappears.
Isn't that right?
Since we have this Fuhrer,
our country has been fighting with someone all the time.
Victory after victory.
And they don't mind leading the war.
We're soldiers.
However,
we have to lead people to despair
before the war,
so that they can create the Philosopher's Stone.
Hey, Tal!
How much longer are you going to sleep?
I'm sorry!
Come on, it's okay.
Actually, it's one of the simplest reactions.
Oh!
Ready!
What is it?
Winry, it's me!
I dressed well in bronze.
There is not a single seam,
so no one will suspect anything
except that it will be split in half.
You're leaving again.
Yes, we have one thing to do here.
I know!
To return Alla his former appearance.
But you can also do research here.
Do you want to take revenge
for Huus?
No.
I will not take revenge.
Otherwise,
the death of Shuram would lose its meaning.
Then...
However, I have to do something.
This is more important than revenge
and what you were looking for.
Ouch!
What are you doing?
I'll make a pigtail for you.
Come on, I'll do it myself.
I'll do it.
Okay.
Isn't it dangerous?
Ed,
where did my father go?
You'd better be quiet.
The soul wears out?
With every transition of our souls
into another body,
they wear out.
Now our souls have no strength
to support the body.
We are going to the end of Dante.
As long as I have the Philosopher's Stone, I will move on to new bodies.
And it will repeat the same thing with every next body.
And I will move on to a new body again!
And where will you take so much Philosopher's Stone for the transitions?
You should have already used the last piece that I left you.
For this, your children were useful.
One of the Swarits turned your son into a Philosopher's Stone.
Dante, so you are...
You didn't get it, did you?
I saw Edward and Alphonse.
I could have guessed what they had done.
No, I already knew that.
But I didn't want to believe it.
I saw Edward and Alphonse.
I saw Edward and Alphonse.
I saw Edward and Alphonse.
I saw Edward and Alphonse.
I saw Edward and Alphonse.
I didn't want to believe it.
Trisha, you will forever be the most beautiful.
Thank you, Gorgensheim the Bright.
Just think, you give in to the usual homunculus.
Since you disappeared, I have understood a lot.
These gates are the source of alchemical power.
And what about them?
Is there a way to open these gates?
These gates are inside us.
And the connection between our soul, mind and body is very weak.
And when the connection is weak?
For example, this little one.
He can easily call the gates.
Let's do an experiment.
Let's see what's there on the other side of the gate.
Trisha, everything will be fine with Edward and Alphonse.
After all, they are your children.
Quiet! Quiet!
Be quiet!
Everything is fine, Gnef.
You will not return to the other side of the gate.
Bring the Philosopher's Stone here.
Gnef, laziness, passion.
Please do not be angry.
I did it for you.
I did it so that you would be reborn.
As soon as I get the Philosopher's Stone, I will change my soul,
then I will definitely make people out of you.
However, it is better for you not to act on my nerves.
Hope you enjoyed!
Here is your son.
If you don't eat, you won't be able to wear my sleeves.
Search carefully!
It's very likely he changed.
You're a real man with a mole, you can't see it from the ground, look, don't miss it!
Oh, that's not the one, we're looking for a very small one.
Commander, we've found a strange bronze statue.
What's its size?
It looks bigger than the armor we were told about.
Just in case, break it with a hammer.
Break it!
This is you, the mole you can't see from the ground!
Al, run!
Wait, Ed!
Al, run!
Ed, I can do it too!
Don't, run!
Thank you, Ed, but...
Al, don't use alchemy.
Why?
I remembered the gate too.
Besides, I'm a Philosopher's Stone now, and maybe I can, like you...
Don't do that!
Al!
We don't know what will happen if you use alchemy.
We'll calmly study everything and give you the same look.
We'll take care of it.
Ed, where are you going?
We were told that there's someone in charge of the homunculus.
I need something to find him.
I'm with you.
You shouldn't.
I'll be back soon.
Ed!
You stay here.
I'll manage on my own.
So, we were both ordered to lead the campaign to the north?
Yes, that's the order.
What we have to do with Ed and Al, we understood from the secretary's case.
At the same time, without blaming anything, we are sent to the front line.
If they want to shut us up, then it's better to go to the front line.
I understand.
I understand.
I understand.
I understand.
If they want to shut us up, then it's better to go to the front line.
But not after the killing of Hughes.
It's suspicious if the same method will be used again.
And you can kill at the front line anytime.
Even if they find some documents and destroy them.
But I still can't believe that he did it himself.
I read the materials that Cheska gave me every evening.
And I couldn't solve this problem.
This is the last piece of the mosaic.
We set up the bait ourselves so that the homunculi would come to us now.
I didn't think you could be here.
I didn't turn on the light.
I wanted to look for something in Dante's things.
Did you find anything?
I'll tell you later.
Come on, put it out.
What do you have?
Probably, you are angry at me again.
Okay.
Tell me.
I don't care what it is.
I need to get one thing.
Don't you have the remains of your dead child?
Are you going to fight?
Yes.
Excuse me.
It's me.
Thank you.
Thank you for coming, Alphonse.
Please teach me how to use the Philosopher's Stone.
Thank you.
Thank you.
