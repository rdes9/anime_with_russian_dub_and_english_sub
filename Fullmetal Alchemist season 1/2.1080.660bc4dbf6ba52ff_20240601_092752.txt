You, you tried to recreate the human body, violated the most terrible prohibition, for which you lost part of your body!
This is why you were called the Steel... Steel Alchemist!
Steel Alchemist
Steel Alchemist
Steel Alchemist
Steel Alchemist
Aha, now I understand.
I was wondering why you were called the Steel... Steel Alchemist.
Rosa, the Alchemist forbids the creation of gold.
In addition, there is one more prohibition according to the silent agreement.
The creation of man.
Stupid boys.
Not knowing about the revenge, you were having fun recreating the human body.
This is not true! We...
We just...
We wanted to see our mother's smile again.
But nothing came out of you.
Yes, Alfons lost his body, and I lost my left leg and my right hand.
This is what happened when two alchemists tried to resurrect one person.
Rosa, this is what happens when a person returns to life.
Are you ready for this?
You have nothing to worry about.
I have a philosophical stone, which was given to me by Leto himself.
Besides, I am much more experienced than these boys.
Don't make fun of them.
There are impossible things, no matter what price you pay for them.
Then why do you need a philosophical stone?
Do you think you can recreate your mother with its help?
You're wrong, bald man.
We just want to return our bodies.
Although, can we?
One more question.
This is the last time I ask you to give us the philosophical stone.
State alchemist, God's wrath will fall on you.
Come here, Third Dispatcher.
I'll show you the power of the stone.
Around you!
I almost got you.
Professor!
You!
Come here!
Boys, there is only one way out.
When there is no way out...
We must take him!
What?
What?
Hey, grab them!
Professor, this is a ring.
God's power is alchemy?
It depends on the person whether to call it alchemy or not.
However, what they did not cope with, I am under pressure.
You waited a long time.
Rose...
King...
Rose...
The miraculous power of the Summer God has resurrected the soul of Cain.
And in a few days his body will be completely restored.
Professor, this is the miraculous power of God, isn't it?
If we only had to take the stone, we could easily do it.
This night two heretics attempted to kill Professor Cornello.
One of them is not tall, the other is covered in old clothes.
Run there!
We have enough of them.
Run there!
That's right, it's them.
This stranger is young.
You can't see anything from here!
I didn't say that!
Come on, calm down.
How dare they try to kill Professor Cornello?
Three cute girls are doing this.
Listen, the miracle of your type is alchemy.
With the help of the decomposition of matter and its structure...
Lies!
Just now, my fiance Cain came back.
Isn't it great, Rose? Cain died from an accident on Sunday?
Well, remember, not only the bride Rose, there were others.
That's right, if it's not a miracle, then what?
Did any of you see them?
After all, they all disappeared from the city at once.
Shut up!
The statue of God of Summer!
The statue of God of Summer
Give it back!
Here it is, the sign of a state alchemist.
For the first time I see such a thing.
The transformation of an alchemical circle.
This icon worked as an amplifier, didn't it?
I didn't sleep at all.
The bell is gone!
Well, feed me, or your hands...
Is it true?
Was it your fiance?
The philosophical stone is our secret, isn't it?
Cain, I'm sorry.
I really want to talk to you for a little while.
Rose...
Professor, I... I'm sorry.
I took the key.
I'm sorry, Rose.
Even having the power of the philosophical stone,
sacrificing the god of the life of these birds,
I was able to create only such a creature.
You didn't like the alchemist who spoke in Cain's voice.
So, say hello to him.
Rose... Rose...
There is only one person left who knows the secret of the philosophical stone.
It's dangerous here. Let's run.
Faster!
Your cheating will soon be revealed.
My parishioners do not distinguish alchemy from the miraculous forces of God.
They don't care, since it makes them happy.
And what do you gain from this?
The basis of alchemy is equal exchange.
If you want to get something, you need to give something equal in return.
The elder brother calls him a genius.
But he became like he is now.
It is because he paid the price with persistent labor.
You paid such a price?
Hand, leg and body.
And now...
And now you're trying to get it all back?
What happened to your mother?
Well, it will start now.
So your goal is money?
Ed?
I have a lot of money from the donations of the parishioners.
My advantage is that my parishioners will gladly give their lives for me.
They believe that I can resurrect them and not be afraid of death.
Soon I will have an invincible army.
Here we will see.
In a few years I will capture this country.
I don't care about your plans.
What do you mean?
You can't really resurrect anyone.
Of course I can't.
If you try to recreate the human body,
with the help of a philosophical stone, it is not known what will happen.
And why should I risk it for the sake of my parishioners?
What is it?
What?
When did you turn on the microphone?
From the very beginning.
How is my broadcasting equipment?
This is my younger brother.
By the way, yesterday you destroyed the doll I created.
It really looks like it.
No, it's all a lie. Don't believe it.
I told you, we have different weight categories.
Priest, is what they just told the truth?
I don't know what these heretics were telling my voice.
It's all a conspiracy.
The proof of this divine power will destroy the heretics.
Here is divine power.
Is this a miracle?
Huh?
Maybe that's enough.
Without this thing, you can only transform your steel prostheses.
That's it. I'll show you the real punishing fist of God.
It can't be!
It's impossible to survive such a huge thing even with the help of the Philosopher's Stone!
What does this watch have to do with it?
My brother is a steel alchemist.
I'll give it to you, Philosopher's Stone!
Tacha!
A fake?
They made such a noise and it's all because of a fake.
Stop it!
Episode One
It's all in vain.
I thought we could finally get your body back.
What do you mean?
We'll deal with you first.
It's probably not good to wear a steel armor.
What can we do? We'll keep looking.
Miracles?
Huh?
Miracles like this gave us hope.
If we believe, even the dead will come back to life.
Only this gave us hope.
Do you want to say that it would be better to leave everything as it was?
And now what? What's next for me to look for support?
Tell me!
You have to decide for yourself.
Stand up and go. Move forward.
At least you have healthy legs for that, don't you?
I think your brother did it for you.
No one asked him.
Believe me, we had to see a lot.
What is this?
You gave me a fake Philosopher's Stone.
Of course.
This city was just a bait.
Those who were looking for the Philosopher's Stone
had to gather here.
And then...
Who are you?
What do you need this for?
Passion.
Can I eat it?
Where did Cornelius go?
He's a prophet.
What is this?
What happened here?
What a horror!
A ghost!
A miracle!
Maybe it's the ghosts again?
They are alive!
I heard that in my absence the devil made trouble here.
Is everything all right with you?
The real one!
The real Professor Cornelius!
Lord Cornelius!
Did you save these boys?
Yes!
I'm sorry, Envy.
You'll have to be in this form for a while.
We had to see a lot of things.
And here's what I'll tell you.
You can't follow our path.
I think so.
We were born and raised in a small village,
to the north of St. Petersburg.
We were raised in a small village,
to the north of St. Petersburg.
We were raised in a small village,
to the north of St. Petersburg.
That's where it all began.
Mom!
Mom, look!
Here!
Ed did this.
And I only have this.
You're both great!
Just like your father!
When a person wants to get something,
he needs to sacrifice something.
So, if you want to get something,
you have to give something equal in return.
In alchemy, this is called the law of equal exchange.
At that time, we believed that this was the truth that ruled the world.
You're always in my eyes.
I can't breathe.
That's all I need.
I think I've had enough.
I'm so small.
I keep making mistakes.
How strong can I be?
I'm so small.
I keep making mistakes.
How strong can I be?
I'm so small.
I keep making mistakes.
How strong can I be?
I'm so small.
I keep making mistakes.
How strong can I be?
I'm so small.
I keep making mistakes.
How strong can I be?
I'm so small.
I keep making mistakes.
How strong can I be?
I keep making mistakes.
How strong can I be?
I keep making mistakes.
How strong can I be?
I keep making mistakes.
I'm so small.
I keep making mistakes.
How strong can I be?
I keep making mistakes.
How strong can I be?
I keep making mistakes.
I keep making mistakes.
That's why we...
