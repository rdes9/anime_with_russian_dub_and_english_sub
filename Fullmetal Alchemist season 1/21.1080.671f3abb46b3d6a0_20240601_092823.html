Well, what happened there?
You're moving so uncertainly.
Of course, an artificially created soul is not perfect.
Just hear the truth about yourself and that's it.
That's the end.
No, no.
I'm Alphonse Ellery.
And I say no to this evidence.
Admit it, it will be easier right away.
And you?
What about you?
You have memories of your life.
And if so?
The End
I'm so glad.
Today I come across one fool after another.
He asks me,
How are you?
It's simple.
I love killing people.
I love you so much, but I love you so much.
There are no words.
I kill,
so I live.
And this is enough to prove that I am still me.
There is no need to confirm such existence.
You.
When a person wants to get something,
he needs to sacrifice something.
Thus, if you want to get something,
you must replace it with something equal.
In alchemy, this is called the law of equal exchange.
At that time, we believed
that this is the truth that rules the world.
The End
The End
The End
It's you!
Did you recognize him?
What a dirty trick!
You had another guy on the farm!
The farmers?
No, no, no!
Hey, hey, what is it?
You are also in such a pitiful body.
Find peace for God's sake.
Why is there this?
And why not?
Didn't you understand
what happened to you?
Answer me!
What do you know about it?
That's how it is.
So you want to know about it?
No, I won't tell you.
The End
The End
Almost 130 years.
The End
Choose.
To stay here with the seagulls
or go with me to have some fun in the garden.
Make your decision faster!
The End
There is one device here
that can destroy everything at any moment
and will be sewn together.
Okay, I have to go.
Bye!
Wait!
If you want to know about your hand,
follow me!
He ran away.
Excuse me!
Where are you going?
If you are here,
the steel one is probably inside now.
Wait!
Wait! I said wait!
The End
What was that?
I don't know.
Bombs were installed in this building
to hide all the evidence in case of something.
I don't know if they will work
because of that.
I haven't figured it out yet.
I will keep my word.
You came to find the secret
of the Philosopher's Stone, right?
I know a little bit
but I can take you to the entrance.
What are we going to do
with the younger brother?
We can't leave him like this.
Don't worry about me.
Just finish me off.
I told you I wouldn't kill you.
You said we are humans.
Then tell me
how to live in such a body?
Well,
it's...
Don't!
Don't connect us!
Do you want us to keep this abandoned building
forever?
In such an empty body?
But we can quit this activity.
And go outside?
What can we do
if we can go outside freely?
Wait!
My younger brother has the same body
as yours.
To get his real body back
I'm looking for the Philosopher's Stone.
If I find it...
If we get our old bodies back
we will be killed.
Do you understand?
Even if we became humans again
we would be killed again.
Do you want the freedom of serial killers?
But you...
Do you treat us like humans?
These are beautiful words.
And do you understand
that it's cruel to treat us
living in such a body as humans?
You fool! What are you doing?
Shut up and look!
What are you talking about?
He's your brother!
He was glad
that you called him a human.
He can't be number 48 anymore.
That's the only thing he can do
as a human.
That's not true!
Brother!
I'm leaving first.
Okay.
No!
As soon as I fulfill my promise
I'll follow you.
What are you thinking about?
What are you both thinking about?
It's the only choice.
I...
Because I treated you like humans
you had no other choice
but to die.
What should I have done
to make him...
There are questions in this world
that have no answer to.
I'll give his former appearance back to Alla.
I can't allow
such a thing to happen to him.
Let's go.
Are we really taking them out?
That's the order.
It seems they will be used
in military research.
They have a life sentence.
But they should all be sentenced to death.
Earthquake?
It's the sound of a collapsing building.
What a pleasant sound.
Kimbley?
It reminds me
of the cleaning in Ishvara.
Come out.
They're calling you too.
Crazy Kimbley
who blew up enemies and allies.
A pleasant sound
warms my heart.
Just like the former
alchemist.
We just have to wait
for the envy to grow.
How long did we wait for this?
Passion.
It's...
It's him.
He?
It can't be.
Greed.
We have to hurry
before he interferes.
Is there
any other strange traps here?
No one has been here
before.
What do you mean?
No one has been here
before?
Who gave you
this look?
So you lied to me about traps.
These are not traps.
Damn it!
Damn it!
Who is it?
The one who created the alchemist.
There's another person here.
If you can call him
a person.
The alchemist.
The alchemist.
He created the alchemist?
True.
Not everyone.
Long time no see,
little Edward.
Tarker.
The alchemist
of the connecting life.
Why?
Why are you here?
Did you see what happened to us
sentenced to death?
So what's strange
is that someone continues to live
as an alchemist.
I'm not talking about that.
Nina.
Nina.
She died because of you.
So why are you still alive?
Just for Nina.
Nina.
Now I understand your feelings.
Listen,
could you stop hunting
for my older brother?
That's the will of Ishvara.
Your brother is a cursed alchemist
and he's looking for
the Philosopher's Stone.
What did alchemy do to you?
There's your right hand,
for example.
I've never seen it before,
but it's an alchemical circle.
This is the mark
of the sacred mission
that will destroy all alchemists.
Besides,
he's looking for the Philosopher's Stone
not to fight,
but to return
my former appearance.
You don't know
the secret of the Philosopher's Stone.
We do.
There's a legend
that the Philosopher's Stone
will be destroyed.
But if we're afraid,
we can't do anything.
By the way,
I heard that Ishvara
also fell because
people got closer to the Philosopher's Stone.
That's not true.
Ishvara didn't just fall.
He was destroyed.
Destroyed.
Brother.
Brother, open up.
Brother.
Brother, is it true
that you used alchemy?
I didn't do anything.
This method doesn't work.
But there's still
the Philosopher's Stone.
Brother, alchemy is
the devilish magic
that changes the form of things.
However,
Ishvara's god
didn't resurrect her.
Brother.
Military.
Brother,
it's dangerous here too.
Brother.
I finally saw
what the Philosopher's Stone is
and why Ishvara's god
put a ban on it.
Brother,
that's enough.
With the help of this devilish power,
Ishvara will be destroyed.
Yes.
That's right.
Ishvara will probably go.
It was
foreseen.
I believed that if I found
the Philosopher's Stone,
I could resurrect it
and save Ishvara.
But no.
To do this, Ishvara
must fall.
What's wrong, brother?
Brother!
Brother!
Mr. Shran,
I know that the Philosopher's Stone
can be made
using human bodies.
We came here
to check it.
If it's true,
then we...
I see.
There's a lot of
confusion today.
You?
Hey,
why do you have that face?
Is it
your brother's?
What are you talking about?
You can eat it.
Armors can
hurt your stomach.
I'll try.
Homunculi.
Homunculi?
It can't be.
The military lied
about your execution
and instead made you create
an alchemist?
Not only an alchemist.
There are other
researches
that are dangerous
for the eyes.
When the soul is connected
to an alchemist,
you also became an alchemist
and saved all the memories
of the person.
Who has such a skill?
Dr. Marco?
Basgran?
Answer me!
Who is it?
Don't look.
She's shy.
Nina.
She can't
keep her form
in contact with the air yet.
You can't
recreate a human.
You created
an alchemist.
You created
an alchemist.
You created an alchemist.
You created
an alchemist.
You created an alchemist.
An alchemist
that looks like Nina.
Several times
I suffered a failure.
As a result,
I was left like this.
However,
there was only one step left.
There was only one step left.
Only one step?
Nina.
Nina.
Nina.
Nina.
Nina.
Nina.
Nina.
Nina.
Nina.
Nina.
Nina.
Nina.
Nina.
What happened to Dr. Marco,
who could not complete
the Philosopher's Stone?
You should know
that even he has
incredible powers.
If I manage
to psych out
so many resources,
then it's possible
to get the sírco Stone.
Then it's possible
to get the sírco Stone.
will get the Philosopher's Stone.
However, no one has ever succeeded before.
This is impossible for an ordinary alchemist.
But I...
But I...
An ordinary alchemist.
But I'm still wandering around.
To the other side of the door.
To the other side of the door.
To the other side.
