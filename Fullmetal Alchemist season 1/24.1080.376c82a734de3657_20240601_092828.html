Come on, eat a little. Eat, you'll get better.
Okay, as you wish.
Listen, what's the point of us getting involved with him?
Do you have any pain? Let me bring you some medicine.
How are you feeling?
He doesn't listen to what I tell him.
We helped him before, but he got tired of it.
Girls have the blood of Ishvars under the protection of our god Ishvar.
It's all in the hands of the gods.
So, are you with us?
Of course, I'm with you.
I was already busy, I'll cut them into pieces and wash them with blood.
Ah!
Kill them all! Don't leave anyone alive!
Oh, no!
Oh, no! Our god sent us new tests!
Oh, no!
When a person wants to get something, he needs to sacrifice something.
So, if you want to get something, you have to replace it with something equal.
That's right. Magic is called the law of equal exchange.
At that time, we believed that it was the truth that ruled the world.
Oh, no!
Oh, no!
Oh, no!
Ed, you started talking to me in Rezimbourg, but stopped.
You said you couldn't ask before, because you were afraid.
You wanted to say that my soul and memories, all this created by you is a fake, right?
No, Ed meant...
Enough!
Is that all you wanted to say?
First you answer my question. Why don't you say anything? Why?
Why?
Why didn't my brother answer me?
If my memories are created by them, what should I do next?
Really?
Maybe the memories about my mother are not real?
Stop!
Stop!
Comrades!
They are here!
Stop!
Stop!
They ran away.
Here, eat.
I don't need it. Why did you suddenly think of stealing in the store?
My mother would...
Look, why are you so patient?
It's not good to take someone else's.
What is it? The old junk has spoken.
Listen, I'm not junk.
And you are not like Schwarzenegger?
No.
Excuse me, have you seen this?
No, I haven't.
I see. Thank you.
Ed, you have no other way out than to find Alla and talk to him.
Ed!
I'm scared.
Me too.
I wanted to ask Alla something for a long time.
But to be honest, I was afraid.
And what is it?
He...
Me...
He...
Me!
I thought you should talk to him.
I'm sorry.
Are you surprised that someone lives in such a place?
Not at all.
I'm sorry that I got caught up with them.
It's okay.
It seems that they are the ones who made the noise.
By the way, I have to tell you that you look quite unusual.
Don't worry, he is not from Armenia.
Mr. Schran?
Hello, Alfonso.
I didn't know you were here.
Do you know each other?
Yes, a little.
Everything is for the best.
Dear guest, please don't tell anyone that we are here.
Don't worry.
I would have also heard about Schran.
But what happened?
The military attacked us.
That's right.
It turned out that they calmed down by killing us.
However, I hate all the states and villages.
If you want to destroy me, do it now.
Your chance will be destroyed.
You hurt each other.
Where is your brother?
I don't know.
What's wrong with him?
Rick, what happened?
I lost my mother's medallion.
I see.
Well, forget it.
That's all.
It happened then.
Hey, wait.
Hey, you can't go out.
Rick, Leo.
I'll go and get them back.
Alfonso, I don't know what happened to you.
But if you hate each other, it's better for me.
Mr. Schran, what do you think about me?
Do you feel anything when you talk to me?
Do you think that I'm a human, despite my body?
Here.
Here they are.
No doubt about it.
Rick, forget it.
Are you looking for this?
Hello.
Yes.
I see.
Follow them and find their shelter.
So this is a farewell gift to mom?
Yes.
What's inside?
I don't know.
But it doesn't matter.
Throw this thing away.
For what?
You can't do that with mom's farewell gift.
This woman is not my mother.
She only told us how to behave.
And she was never kind to us.
Never.
Did she take care of you?
No.
She didn't care about us.
I remember.
What's going on here?
Or this boy wants to forget his past?
It's the opposite with me.
I want to get my memories back.
I want to feel that these are my true memories.
Go ahead.
Wait.
I'm going.
Go ahead.
Wait.
Everything is fine here.
What is this?
Bastard!
Let me go, Rika!
Yes, yes. Yes, I understand. Thank you.
Wait, Al, where are you? What are you trying to do?
This will be difficult.
I found out that they use the military base outside the city. Rika must be there.
But Mr. Shram, are you sure? We're going to fight.
What? Not satisfied with the fact that you're going with us? Yes?
No, because...
The Shvarts value blood ties the most.
To save Rika, even an old man like me is ready to give up his life.
Exactly. For us and the Shvarts, it is important.
Although...
Our mother still abandoned us.
What? The bell rang?
It seems he got involved in something suspicious.
That bitter day for the Shvarts...
Mom prayed as usual.
Hey, Rika!
Hey, Rika!
Hey, Rika!
And I decided that Rika didn't have to know about it.
I'll protect her myself.
It's there.
The military will give us a lot of money for this little fish.
We can have a little fun.
As ordered, we caught one guy.
They'll probably come for him, right?
Yeah, everyone knows how close they are.
What if we lure a guy in armor and a man with a scar?
What's that?
Alchemist, huh?
Sit down!
Here we have a man with a scar.
You'll deal with the armor, and this one is mine.
Mr. Shram!
What a meeting, little brother.
What are you doing here?
You can't do that.
You don't exist.
You're just an artificial being.
I'll set you free from this.
And then you won't have to fight,
thinking whether you have a real memory or not.
Stop!
This is my memory.
Ed, why are you here?
And you're still asking?
He was so worried about you and was looking for you everywhere.
Ed.
I was afraid to ask you all the time.
You hate me.
You hate me.
It's me who put you in these armor.
That's why...
That's why I thought maybe you...
You hate me for that.
Ed, is that what you wanted to tell me?
Al, back off!
Ed, I...
I have nothing to do with you.
What?
I'm still alive.
It turns out that a guy who hears such rumors
can miss if he feels very bad.
Shoot him or someone else!
Stop it.
Look, you're left alone.
Who are you?
The same as you, an army dog.
An army dog?
A state alchemist?
That's impossible!
It's amazing, Ed.
So you're a state alchemist.
Let me thank you for putting me in this.
What's the matter?
You fool! Let me go!
Rick!
Not this!
Rick!
Rick! Rick!
Why?
Rick!
Mom saved me.
I'm alive.
I'm alive.
This is a medicine for the eyes.
Medicine?
Looks like your mom had a bad vision.
And she didn't want to bother you,
so she pretended to see everything.
One day she told me that because of her health
she couldn't give anything to the children.
She must have had a heart attack because of you.
I didn't see it.
I think...
Leo! Rick! Leo! Rick!
I didn't see it.
Mom, it means she went to the orphanage to look for us.
Mom...
What does it mean?
I work for the army.
Why is a state alchemist in my way?
Hey, are you listening to me?
Say something!
Where are you going now?
There are people who live like us,
hiding from persecution.
We decided to visit them.
Al, thank you for everything.
Now I will appreciate the memories of my mom.
Always.
Yes.
And me.
My memories.
My real memories.
Alphonse Alrick,
at that moment I saw,
I saw in your eyes
invisible tears.
You are a human after all.
Mr. Schramm.
Schramm, tell me one thing.
You have to know this.
Did Ishvartsev have a Philosopher's Stone?
Did the military hunt for it?
No, they didn't.
They were looking for a Philosopher's Stone
to save themselves from the destruction
that was killing us.
So you found it?
A Philosopher's Stone?
Hey, wait!
Ed, let them go.
Mr. Schramm needs these people.
Alph, let's go.
Yes.
Now, as you remember,
we always quarreled
only because of different things.
Yes.
From above or from below,
to sleep on a grass bed, for example.
I lost to you then.
And also because of the toy.
I won then.
I won.
I won.
I won.
I won.
And also because of the toy.
I won.
I won.

I won.
The 25th episode.
Farewell ceremony.
Let's go on a journey,
not telling anyone about it.
After all, we did it all the time.
