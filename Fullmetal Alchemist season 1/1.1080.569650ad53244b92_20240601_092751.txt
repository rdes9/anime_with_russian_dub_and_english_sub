Episode 1
It's ready.
Everything's fine. Just perfect.
Yes.
Let's begin.
Yes.
What is alchemy?
This is a science that can be used to understand the structure of matter,
to decompose it into components,
and then to gather it together again with another structure.
If you're lucky, you can even make gold out of lead.
However, being a science, alchemy is based on the laws of nature.
To create one matter, you need to take another matter,
the law of equal exchange.
What? What's going on?
The law of equal exchange states that when you receive something,
you have to sacrifice something equivalent.
Perhaps this is a lesson.
To receive something, you have to sacrifice something.
Al! Al! Alphonse!
Damn! This can't be!
Damn! This can't be!
No! My leg!
Mom!
Mom!
How I want to eat.
There's no grass here.
I'd turn it into bread.
Al! Al! Where are you? Al! Al!
I'm here.
Ed, help me!
Ed, help me!
You fell asleep again.
If this happens again, I'll leave you.
What's wrong with you?
Al!
Come on, stop!
I won't!
Stop, I said!
Not at all!
I won't!
Or I'll kill you!
Even more so!
Ed, how are you?
I told you to stop.
You had such a voice.
No one would stop.
Really?
I want to drink.
Water! Water!
Water! Water! Water!
Water! Water! Water!
Ed!
Where did this smell come from?
Ed!
Blood?
Wine. Red like blood.
Hey, you!
You can't drink that!
Excuse me.
I didn't understand at first that you were travelers.
There's wine!
What a rich city, Mr. Leor!
There's even a fountain with wine.
That's why...
I almost forgot.
God of Chada, who lives on this earth,
have faith,
raise your prayers,
and you will receive salvation.
God of the sun and the summer
will enlighten our way.
What's that weirdo saying?
It's a sermon.
Look at yourself!
You yourself are weirdos!
I am the representative of the god of the summer
and your father.
And what are you?
Are you wandering actors?
Listen, uncle,
we are actors.
If you are not actors,
why did you come here?
We are looking for something here.
By the way, who said that?
The representative of the carnel.
I am asking who it is.
Don't you know the representative of the summer?
The god of the sun?
And who is it?
The representative of the carnel.
He does miracles.
I am the representative of the carnel.
The abandoned city in the desert
has become so prosperous.
An incredible man.
He really has a wonderful power.
I am not interested in religion.
Let's go, Alla.
What are you doing?
And why are you dressed like that?
Sorry, we'll fix everything now.
What do you mean?
Sorry, please.
Brother, I'll do it myself.
Come on.
What is this?
Alchemical circle.
Ready.
Let's go.
And I am the representative of the god of the summer.
Oh, that's right.
It turns out that you also have a wonderful power.
What kind of power?
We are alchemists.
We are the Elric brothers.
The name is quite well known.
Alchemists?
This is not a divine power.
We don't have much to say about alchemists.
We are alchemists.
We don't have much to say about alchemists.
We are alchemists.
We don't have much to say about alchemists.
We don't have much to say about alchemists.
We don't have much to say about alchemists.
The Steel Alchemist Edward Elric.
The Steel Alchemist Edward Elric.
Isn't that right?
This name is well known in the East.
And the talent of this alchemist is a legend.
And the talent of this alchemist is a legend.
Cool.
Now I understand.
And the nickname Steel is because of the armor?
You are so famous.
But it's not me.
What?
Is it really this kid?
You are so famous.
You are so famous.
You are so famous.
You are so famous.
You are so famous.
You are so famous.
Hi Rose.
I haven't seen you before.
I haven't seen you before.
I am Alphonse Elric.
I am Alphonse Elric.
And I am the Steel Alchemist.
I am the Steel Alchemist Edward Elric.
So you are the Steel Alchemist?
So you are the Steel Alchemist Edward Elric.
Come on.
Rose, have you finished
the shopping for the church?
Yes.
Then will you take the kids to the summer church?
They are looking for something.
They don't need the divine help.
They don't need the divine help.
What?
There are rooms for guests.
You can stay overnight.
I see.
Then we will use the invitation, Alphonse.
Then we will use the invitation, Alphonse.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Our Rose is so funny.
Our Rose is so funny.
Yes.
Thanks to her.
Thanks to her.
Thanks to her.
Thanks to her.
Alphonse...
You never had to see
that lady from the shop.
I will be all right.
I will find what you are looking for.
Besides...
If we pray,
then we can grow.
Who is praying?
Sorry.
Brother!
Pray and believe, and then your wish will come true.
May the blessing of the world be with you forever and ever, my children.
Wonderful speech, Professor.
We thank you for these priceless words.
Professor!
Oh, it's you, Rosa.
Will it be possible for a traveler to stay in the guest rooms?
And day by day you give all your strength to serve God.
Yes, for the sake of God in the summer I am always ready, so ...
God sees all your good deeds.
And the fact that the miracle has not yet happened is just a matter of time.
Of course.
I heard that this is the grave of her fiance, Rosa.
She has no relatives.
In an accident, her fiance's life was taken away.
Rosa hopes only for the words of her ancestor, Cornel.
But the dead do not return.
And here they say that they return.
A living eternal life, a dead resurrection.
It seems that miracles are being performed here in confirmation of this.
This is nonsense.
What do you say?
I think these transmutations are pure alchemy.
It looks like it.
But what about the laws?
Here you are.
Well, what do you say about the miraculous power of Professor Cornel?
This is alchemy.
And your Cornel is a real crook.
Not exactly.
However, he violates the laws.
Laws?
In alchemy, you can't get anything out of nothing.
Because this is a science that strictly follows the laws of nature.
Having one substance, you can also get only one substance.
Just as I was able to create only a radio of the same size.
It is impossible to create a radio of a larger size or turn it into paper or wood.
In order to get something, you need an equal replacement.
And he acts contrary to this law.
That's why you are told that this is a miracle.
Can you repeat such a thing with your alchemy?
And who?
Soon.
The Eureka brothers?
I heard that the elder brother received the title of a state alchemist at the age of 12.
He is called the Steel Alchemist.
This boy?
He is one of the army leaders.
The military put the title of the state alchemist on him.
They are going to get into our affairs.
I must save my people, my chads.
Clay?
And fulfill the will of the Lord.
Thank you for letting me know.
Isn't it too reliable to rely on him alone?
Just in case, I have a backup plan.
I have a backup plan just in case.
So, if you can serve God as you do,
can you resurrect the one who once died?
Yes, of course.
Of course.
35 liters of water, 20 kilograms of carbon,
4 liters of amyak, 1.5 kilograms of iron,
800 grams of phosphorus, 250 grams of salt,
100 grams of sel, 80 grams of sulfur,
7.5 grams of storo, 5 grams of iron,
3 grams of creme and 15 other elements in small doses.
What is it?
These are the substances that make up the body of an average adult human.
And although modern science knows this,
not a single successful case of the creation of a human body is known.
Scientists have been fighting over what they can't get for several hundred years.
And in their efforts there is more sense than just praying and waiting.
By the way, these components can buy any child on the market for pocket money.
Human is a cheap thing.
Human is not a thing. You are insulting God.
Alchemists are scientists. We do not believe in such inaccurate concepts as God.
There is an irony in the fact that we are most similar to the gods.
You are not God. Stop it.
The sun is not God either.
It's just a cluster of high-temperature substances.
If you get too close to the sun, you'll just burn out.
Brother, so angry mind.
Do not worry. Your brother will join you soon.
Brother Clay, what are you doing?
Dear God, this is God's will.
I was even scared.
What?
My head.
Strike!
What's going on?
Everything is fine.
Here, you see?
Inside, empty.
This is a punishment for the fact that we entered a sacred area where people have no access.
For me and my brother.
Rosa!
So it's true.
As the teacher said, these people are God's enemies.
I did not know what was going on here.
Rosa!
Well done for bringing them here, Rosa.
So you are a state alchemist.
I knew you would appear here.
Because you are a charlatan and fool parishioners or because of a philosophical stone.
Are you talking about this?
For your transmutation, you do not draw an alchemical circle.
You violate the law of equal exchange.
Of course.
This is a philosophical stone, a mysterious booster of inner power, which allegedly exists only in legends.
I was looking for it.
I suggest directly.
Give it to me.
Then I will not say anything to the citizens and just leave.
Do you want to say that you will take it from me?
And if there is no my miraculous power, what will happen to this city?
So, Rosa.
Rosa, he's just a third-rate charlatan.
I brought back to life this city, destroyed by civil war.
I created water, turned it into wine, built houses and gave people money.
I am God's scapegoat.
And you want to take God away from these citizens?
You are so faithful to the orders of the military.
I do not care about the orders of the military.
What?
I do not care.
We need this stone ourselves.
But why?
You know that it will deprive us of hope and all the same.
Rosa, we are ...
It is useless.
It is useless.
So, let me show you the power of the Philosopher's Stone.
Al!
You will be disturbed by the armor.
And you are on the sand, not on the earth, alchemical circle.
Al!
With the help of the Philosopher's Stone, you merge into a single living creature.
Exactly!
This is a chimera!
It's hard to deal with this.
With bare hands!
How to create weapons without an alchemical circle?
Forward!
Well?
How to say?
Will you take it away?
Well, kitty?
Can not try?
Listen, this is ...
What the hell?
A leg that can not be torn apart with such claws!
What the hell?
A leg that can not be torn apart with such claws!
A leg that can not be torn apart with such claws!
A leg that can not be torn apart with such claws!
A hand that can not be torn apart with such claws!
It can not be that you ...
Can!
Rosa, look carefully.
Not the one who broke into the divine area trying to recreate a person.
Here he is the criminal!
Mechanic hand and leg?
Auto armor?
You!
You tried to recreate a human body!
You broke the most terrible ban!
For what you lost part of your body!
And if you get too close to the sun, you'll just burn.
So that's why you were called a steel ...
