Episode 1
Welcome!
A warm welcome is waiting for you.
Something is not very warm.
I am assigned to guard this place.
Allow me to introduce myself, my name is number 48.
Number 48?
I am glad that in some century I will be able to make peace with the forces of a worthy opponent.
You and I are fated to be together.
So, boy, don't hold a grudge against me.
You'd better not hold a grudge against a boy who beat you.
How nice!
So huge and so mobile.
Who are you?
You need to answer when asked who you are.
My name is number 66.
These are nicknames associated with my previous work.
Number 66?
There is a real name.
But you will make a fine when you hear it in your pants.
I will call it to you before I finally break you.
The same sound.
Max!
It's him.
The same as before.
The armor instead of the body.
When a person wants to get something, he needs to sacrifice something.
Thus, if you want to get something, you must give something equal in return.
In alchemy, this is called the law of equal exchange.
At that time, we believed that this is the truth that rules the world.
The same as before.
The same as before.
The same as before.

Huh?
That's crap.
Looks like there are other idiots besides me,
who have come up with the idea of attaching the soul to the armor.
How interesting.
Let me call you again.
I'm number 48.
This is the number of the prisoner, Smertnik.
Two years ago, the sentence was introduced.
Smertnik?
So there is a connection between the fifth lab and the neighboring prison.
When I was a man of blood and flesh,
I was nicknamed Slicer.
I was a killer,
who really scared the public and the military.
And now because of this, I am turned into a guard dog with an immortal body.
No, you are not immortal.
What?
Blood seal.
Metal particles contained in the blood
attach to the metal armor,
holding your soul in this world.
If you destroy this seal,
you will die.
I haven't met such a brave guy in a long time.
This fight promises to be very interesting.
I know your weak spot.
It's better for you to surrender right now.
It doesn't matter.
I am one of those who loves dangerous battles.
So, let's get started.
What is this?
I have a strange feeling in my body.
What is this?
I have a strange feeling in my body.
I have a strange feeling in my body.
What is this?
I have a strange feeling in my body.
I have a strange feeling in my body.
I have a strange feeling in my body.
What is this?
I have a strange feeling in my body.
Light parts have less strength,
so be careful.
I need to finish this before I get too serious.
You're jumping like a monkey.
Shut up, you idiot!
I'm glad that you've gotten serious in some way.
I'm glad that you've gotten serious in some way.
I'm glad that you've gotten serious in some way.
But with your wounds and fatigue, the outcome of the battle is already clear.
As you can see, my body is not getting tired.
Give up!
With your companion, which is left on the street, my partner is being divided right now.
Don't count on help.
And how is your partner strong?
Strong, but not as strong as me.
What's so funny about that?
Then I have nothing to worry about.
We fight a lot with Al, but I've never won.
Well, let's go.
There's nothing to be afraid of, I'll tear you to pieces now!
Now!
Well, that's too much.
Now you're going to get hurt!
Don't say that!
Now!
I'll cut you into pieces!
Cool!
Even my head fell off.
Your body?
For a number of reasons, I got this body.
And now you don't know who I was before.
Just don't say you forgot.
I was sentenced to death because you caught me.
Number 66 is the number sentenced to death.
And when I was made of flesh and blood, I had a nickname.
Serena the killer, Barry the butcher.
Barry the butcher?
The same Barry?
Exactly.
After I was arrested and sentenced to death, I rose from the depths of hell to avenge you.
Ah!
Now you know!
What do you mean?
The executioner survived.
Shouldn't you be surprised?
You should yell out, ai!
Or, oh, mom!
Or, ah, what is it?
What is it?
How ugly!
Behave yourself.
So you were sentenced to death, too.
I'm not a criminal.
However, it's very good that I found out about it.
Your weak spot.
If you find the blood seal somewhere inside the armor and destroy it, you'll die.
So be ready!
Well, the same applies to you.
But you don't know where my seal is!
And you don't know where mine is!
Ah!
I'll tear you to pieces and I'll find the seal!
What is it?
Nothing is found in the B and C blocks.
It must be somewhere nearby. Find it at any cost.
Yes, sir!
An attack on a military object. A decisive guy.
But why then does Mr. Elric persistently pursue Shram?
Where are the Elric brothers?
Well, how to say...
Come on, come on!
Major Armstrong!
Can we take advantage of your authority?
What are you talking about?
At the moment, the Elric brothers are in the fifth lab of the headquarters.
Tell me!
What happened?
You're barely moving?
Is it over, baby?
Who is it here, baby, who is not visible on the ground?
Ha! I like your mood.
But how long will you be enough?
Again this car armor.
I'll take care of it.
Again this car armor.
You underestimate me.
Do you think you can beat me with a spear?
Funny.
You fought well, but now you're at the limit.
Please, you do not win.
How to tell you?
How to tell you?
You forgot that I'm not alone here.
Come on!
Please!
What is it?
This is a deception!
Any trick will come in the fight.
What's the matter?
The blood seal is not yet destroyed.
If the soul is tied to the head, then it is enough to cut it off and the body will become a simple pile of metal.
There is no more reason to fight.
And I would like to ask you something.
About the Philosopher's Stone?
Since you came here, it is unlikely that you have some other goal.
The easier it will be for us to talk.
Come on, spread everything you know.
No, I will not.
What?
We will still have a dispute here.
Then I will destroy your blood seal.
And I have not lost yet.
How?
I'm an idiot!
It is not necessary that the armor has only one soul.
The blood seal is also on Keras.
Well, how are you, senior?
How much younger are you?
Younger?
By the way, I forgot to tell you, my friend.
Slicer is your brother-in-law.
That is, the head and the body themselves are not too honest.
And who said that any trick will come in the fight?
How dare you hurt my older brother!
Now you will answer me, bitch!
Do not call me bitch, I will show you!
I will not give you time for transmutation!
Too bad I lost a lot of blood.
The head is already spinning.
No!
Here is Blip!
Will I die here?
Damn it!
If I die here ...
If I die ...
Who will then give his body back?
For my brother!
For mine!
You will not make it!
I remembered someone.
No!
Unbelievable.
He laid him on the component without completing transmutation.
Sorry.
But I can not die yet.
Damn it!
How dare you, boy!
How angry you are!
Damn it, I'm not done yet!
Damn it!
Brother!
Brother!
Yes, it's a shame.
But we lost, brother.
You will not now declare that there were three brothers?
No, no.
Impressive, baby.
This time it's really your victory.
Then tell me everything you know.
I can not.
So let's destroy us faster.
What?
The loser dies.
This is our rule.
I do not kill people like that.
What sentiments?
Our bodies.
Is it possible to call such a person?
I do not tell you to kill.
I say to destroy.
Come on.
If I admit that you are not people, then it turns out
that for me
my younger brother Al
is also not a human.
Younger brother?
Damn it!
Damn it!
Maybe we'll stop at this?
There is no brother for a long time.
Brother?
This short-haired alchemist is your older brother?
If you talk about growth, he will get angry.
I see.
What are you doing?
That is, your older brother put you in these armor?
Yes.
I risked my life and he made this transmutation for me.
What a good boy he is!
What's funny here?
Sorry, sorry.
What a beautiful brotherly love.
Even if this love is fake.
Fake?
That's right, fake.
This is not true.
My brother really loves me.
What a naive boy.
And if you are not real yourself, what then?
And if your character and your memories are created by the hands of your brother for his own benefit,
what then?
Can this be true?
I am sure that I am a man named Alphonse Elric.
How can you prove it?
After all, this soul is incomprehensible, you will not see it with your eyes.
Maybe your brother and all the others are just fooling around you.
This can not be.
My brother is a man, and you are people.
I am afraid of murder.
Brother, are you serious?
Interesting, very interesting.
As far as we remember, we were plundering, destroying and killing.
We were called demons and devils.
Everyone was treated the same way.
And now, when we have lost humanity,
we were treated like people for the first time.
Interesting.
I am a man, I am Alphonse Elric.
And if you have proof that you really existed, where is your body?
This can not be.
This is a deception.
This can not be.
This can not be.
Listen, Alph, I wanted to tell you for a long time,
but it was so scary that I could not.
What?
What was he trying to tell me, brother?
So scary that he could not.
What could he not say?

This is the first episode of the Yellow Glow.
If human life had color, it would probably be...
...yellow.
