What is it?
I wonder what's going on with the others.
There are many people in the East with the same skin color as yours.
So, they can hide.
However, they consider you the organizer of the rebellion in Leoria.
Oh.
This...
It looks like the Summer God's cathedral.
It's an older religion.
The cathedral is abandoned now.
They say that this religion recognized only one God.
It considered the faith of other gods to be a heresy.
Because of this, a lot of people died.
What a nightmare!
After all, the call of the Summer God is not to be called the Summer God.
It's to be called the Summer God.
The Summer God is the one who is the most powerful.
The Summer God is the one who is the most powerful.
The Summer God is the one who is the most powerful.
What a nightmare!
After all, the call of the religion is to save people.
It's just that people can't become gods.
Vanya, Vanya, everything is fine.
Why did you let these two go?
Wasn't it your task to destroy the brothers, Lenya?
And the anger?
I'll find them.
You went against the will of that man.
Lenya, don't you want to become a human?
Yes, I do.
I was born to become one.
I have no other goals.
They have arrived.
The Philosopher's Stone.
Those who have acquired it
don't depend on the law of equal exchange.
And in order to get something,
they shouldn't give equal exchange anymore.
We were looking for it and got it.
The Summer God is the one who is the most powerful.
The Summer God is the one who is the most powerful.
The Summer God is the one who is the most powerful.
The Summer God is the one who is the most powerful.
The Summer God is the one who is the most powerful.

All this bullshit about a casual unconventional신
Whatever has done to make hope media
And warrants not to come back
That's what it means to be aachment
Give me the world
And the project
Or give me hope
To be seeds
Not to arrive
Just as a question
Forsee
To игры
To play
Like to be 저 damned

KING BRADLEY
Why did you run away without asking for my help?
Guys, what happened?
KING BRADLEY
HOMUNCUL
Homuncul is an artificial human?
Yes. They need the Philosopher's Stone and they manipulate the whole country.
That's the way it is.
The Fuhrer didn't know anything about the fifth laboratory.
He was so sorry about the corruption in the army.
But I saw it myself. The Fuhrer has the sign of Uroboros.
You say Homunculs can change their appearance.
The Fuhrer's secretary is also a Homuncul.
But she's an alien.
If the Fuhrer and the Secretary Douglas are Homunculs, what do they need? Why did they join the army?
Why did they join the army?
I'll bring them back to Leor and I'll come up with a good reason for them not to return to the Central for some time.
Do it. And we're going to Risenburg.
Gentlemen, we're glad to have you. Our mission has come to an end.
Major, what are you talking about?
Can't you hear how my muscles are singing?
No, we're not talking about that.
Listen to me.
By the way, how's Hewok?
He's fine. He's been sent back with the Fuhrer.
I see. I'm sorry.
Ed, what about the silver watch?
That's right. You can't be a state alchemist anymore, if it's all true.
No, it's not about that. Archer took them from me.
What? We asked Alla to return them to you.
I'm sorry. They disappeared.
Did you lose them?
No, no. Kimble threw the watch in the locker.
And then they fell into the hands of the scar.
Why were there these stones in the silver watch?
Archer used his trick again to get the amplifier.
What?
Once upon a time, Brigadier General Gran gave us the red stones.
Wait, Colonel. You knew that the military were trying to create a philosophical stone.
But I didn't know anything about it.
I thought that Mark's escape had stopped the project.
And I didn't know that the raw material for them was people.
I don't believe it.
Ed!
You couldn't have forgotten this crap and pushed us to create a philosophical stone.
Stop it, Ed!
Enough!
Brother!
Ed!
Alla!
Oh, Alla!
Alla!
Alla!
Alla!
Oh, Alla!
We can't go into the water!
Alla!
Alla!
Ed!
I can swim!
I'm swimming!
Idiot!
Ah!
Shouldn't the blood print have washed off if you got into the water?
Yes.
I guess we shouldn't worry about it now.
Maybe it's because I became a philosophical stone?
I see, I see!
What was that?
It was here.
Oh!
You said it was a philosophical stone.
No!
Nothing!
Nothing!
Well, let's go!
Ed!
Wait!
Looks like the investigators haven't arrived yet.
Oh!
It's Blosch!
Behind you!
Ah!
No!
It's not her!
Blosch!
Did something shake?
Rosetta!
Rosetta!
The wings of the eagle, which I saw a long time ago, were blue and black, just like your hair.
I thought I would never see such beauty again.
Oh my God!
Are you kidding me?
She's always thinking about work, but she's lost it here!
Here she is!
What's the matter?
It's nice to see you.
Well, who's this stranger?
Oh, Ed!
Oh!
What are you doing to me?
Edward!
He came back after 10 years and he's stuck right away!
Daddy!
Dad?
That's right!
Just like in the photo!
Dad!
Dad!
It's Dad!
It's Dad!
You...
You probably don't recognize me, do you?
Alfons!
How did you grow up?
Dad, you recognized me!
Edward!
And you still hate milk?
Who is it here?
He was a good boy, but he stayed!
But he didn't say that!
Well, how can it be, Edward?
Okay, okay!
Don't get me wrong, I just listened to his story about traveling.
And with what pleasure!
But he's a real gentleman.
And even, even a little bit on the soul...
There's no such thing in the army!
Well, what am I supposed to do now, huh?
And what are you grumbling about?
That smell...
I hated it!
Right after...
After Alla was born, that guy left...
From home.
Mom said he was doing alchemy.
However, letters never came from him.
But the smell of his adicolum soaked the whole house.
When I met Laila in Lyur, her perfume smelled the same.
You met Laila?
That means she could run away from the house of Danza!
Wait a minute!
What kind of relationship does this Laila have with you?
I'm sorry.
Oh, Winry!
Why do you need a wrench?
I'm sorry.
Come here!
The Fuhrer is married, and he has children.
Besides, I saw his photos in his youth.
Communes, when they are born, are not like people at all.
If you give them a red stone, they acquire human appearance and strength.
They feed on human lives?
With age, they acquire the ability to change their appearance.
Perhaps he has adopted children.
And...
He's still a homunculus.
But...
That means...
You say that red stones were created in the fifth laboratory.
Homunculus cannot use alchemy.
But why not tell them how to create it?
Because...
Someone controls them?
Yes.
Even if they are homunculus, this country continues to exist, and the army functions.
You don't have to worry about it.
Why can't homunculus use alchemy?
They came from another country, brother.
But I want to ask you much more, Trisha.
And about what you dedicated yourself to.
Dad!
From your point of view, I understand that you...
We have nothing to tell you.
We have suffered a failure in alchemy.
We have lost our arms, legs and body.
Just that.
Edward, alchemy is...
Shut up!
It's too late to show your concern.
Mom has been waiting for you all this time.
Al, let's get out of here!
Ed!
Ed, I'll go with Dad.
Al!
Let's go, Dad.
Is it possible to restore the appearance of my body with the help of the Philosopher's Stone?
With the help of the Philosopher's Stone, you can attach the soul to someone else's body.
Someone else's body?
No, I...
Your body was lost.
According to the law, it is equal in exchange.
Having given your body, you must have received something in return.
Something?
If you can give everything back, then you will return the body.
So, if I win over those homunculi...
Huh?
Ah!
Ah!
No!
It's okay, it's okay.
Do you know everything well, Dad?
Oh!
I wanted to ask you one more thing.
Dad?
Since everything is coming out like this, it was necessary to make him stronger yesterday.
Dad?
Dad?
Dad?
Dad?
Dad?
Dad?
Dad?
Dad?
Dad?
Dad?
Dad?
Dad?
Dad?
Dad?
Dad?
Dad?
Dad?
Dad?
Dad?
Dad?
Dad!
Dad?
Dad?
Dad?
Dad?
Dad?
Dad?
Dad?
Dad?
Dad?
Dad?
Dad?
Dad?
Dad?
Dad?
Dad?
Dad?
Dad?
Dad?
Dad?
Dad?
I'll take you with me.
See you at town.
Your heart flutters.
I intend to establish the truth about the Fuhrer on my own.
And if you understand that this is really true?
Well, then.
Let's quickly get into the cellar.
What? What for?
And you too.
Where did Dad go?
Be quiet.
I'm much more interested in how the colonel is going to find out the truth about the Fuhrer and the others.
Oh, I see.
This is the secretary.
She should be at the service of no more than four years.
Yes.
Juliette Douglas?
At least she's been in the army for 14 years.
That can't be.
That's for sure.
After all, she became the main reason for the uprising in Ishwar.
Oh, this is the story of when the military, by mistake, shot a civilian.
And she was killed.
What?
The pretext for the beginning of military actions in Ishwar was created by a special army unit.
Horrible.
So...
So, Ishwar is also for the sake of the Philosopher's Stone.
If Ishvarts were forced to war...
Maybe someone would have created the Philosopher's Stone with the help of great teaching.
Did they really go that far?
All this was arranged with homunculi.
That's how Hughes figured it out.
And that's why he was killed.
I'll show it to you all.
Wait!
It happened right after we left the station.
You bastards! And you kept it a secret from me.
Did you know?
I'm sorry. I found out about it not long ago.
Anyway, go back inside.
I'm not kidding.
If Lieutenant Colonel Hughes was killed, it's our fault.
And despite that, Roy...
Enough.
If he didn't tell you, it doesn't mean you're to blame.
I heard about it from Hughes.
He seemed to know a lot.
But Mustang didn't want you to think only about revenge.
After all, there are more important things.
Maybe that's why he didn't tell you.
But...
I was wrong all this time.
I thought Lieutenant Colonel Hughes had nothing to do with it.
But maybe...
I'll be the first man in this country.
He promised me that.
And that's why he decided to let go of his emotions and revenge...
...to keep moving forward.
Lieutenant Colonel Hughes is an adult.
It can't be.
Your dear man was killed, and you know who the killer is.
But there's something more important than revenge.
Is that how adults behave?
But you became an army dog for the sake of achieving your goal.
I hate this bastard.
Someone's coming!
Don't talk nonsense. This place...
Who is it?
Welcome.
Unfortunately, the owner is not here.
This body is called Lila, isn't it?
You're so smart, Guggenheim.
You still couldn't forget me.
I heard your name from your sons.
You came to save me?
No.
It's the other way around, Dante.
Let's eat!
I'm scared.
No alchemy either.
Let's eat.
I'm scared.
No alchemy either.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
He's been in this body for too long.
And he's already close to his limit.
Your end is near.
That's true. But so is yours.
You can hide your decaying body under your clothes,
but this smell won't deceive me.
Guggenheim.
Dante, stop making fun of my sons.
Promise me that.
And I'll tell you why your body is rotting.
Looks like we managed to get them back.
Looks like it.
Where is he?
He said he had to do something on his own.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Mom.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
To be continued...
I'll fight.
You don't have to do anything anymore.
