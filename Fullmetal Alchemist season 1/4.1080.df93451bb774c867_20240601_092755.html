        <pre>That's why on the day we went on the road, we set our house on fire, so that there was no way back.
Do you really not mind? Don't you regret that we left the village?
Ed, what are you talking about? This is my decision.
Aren't you sad?
No, I'm delighted. After all, I will be a state alchemist. I will become one.
I'm also very happy. After all, I will fix your body.
Come on, you better think about yourself.
I wonder what it takes to become a state alchemist. What do you need to learn?
If he remains alive after trying to transmute a person, perhaps he will become a great state alchemist.
Let's first meet this very Roy.
Come on! With my amazing talent, it's easier than simple!
Do you think about Winry?
You can't do anything. The guys decided so. They will probably come back as adults.
Ed! Al!
When a person wants to get something, he needs to sacrifice something.
Thus, if you want to get something, you must give something equal in return.
In alchemy, this is called the law of equal exchange.
At that time, we believed that this was the truth that ruled the world.
You can't do anything. The guys decided so.
You can't do anything. The guys decided so.

You can't do anything.
You can't do anything.
You can't do anything!
You can't do anything!
And you know what train we need to take?
Tomorrow at 9 a.m.
I need to sleep.
My bag!
Al?
Yeah.
What's going on today?
Kids!
What's going on?
What's going on?
What's going on?
What's going on?
What's going on?
Kids!
Calm down!
What's going on?
Is that you sitting still?
Wow!
Wow!
And this thing is alchemy, right?
Kind of.
You're so young and already alchemists.
There's only one alchemist in our region.
Madjihal.
Madjihal?
Yeah.
He's helped people many times with his alchemy.
People respect him a lot.
How do we find him?
He lives in the neighboring village.
But it's better not to go there now.
There are bad rumors going around.
In this village, the dead resurrect and attack the inhabitants.
Ed, do you know this Madjihal?
No.
But I had to see his name in the letters.
In the letters of his father?
I think they were discussing the transmutation of man.
If it's that alchemist, we should meet him.
Yeah.
I feel like we're going to have a good trip.
Why are you so happy?
Me?
We caught the thieves.
Everyone praised us.
It's good that our alchemy is good for people.
Ed, are you okay?
No, I'm not okay.
The seat was hard and the whole road was shaking.
What would you care?
Yes.
Wow.
Cool decoration.
Is it a holiday?
Oh, shit.
It went to the side of the village.
What are you doing here?
Passage is prohibited here.
We're starting test fireworks.
Fireworks?
What the hell?
Fireworks for the holiday. What else?
You haven't been here before.
What kind of guy is he?
He looks weird.
Stop it.
Come on, let's figure it out.
It's done.
Weaklings.
What's going on here?
What's going on here?
It's you, Majihal.
Wow.
Amazing.
An amazing connection of souls.
He sees everything through.
You really are the sons of Guggenheim.
It's clear why you have such abilities.
So, what brought you here?
If my dear Guggenheim's son has a request,
there's no reason not to listen to you.
I wanted to ask you about the transmutation of a man
you wrote to your father.
Transmutation of a man?
You know, it's forbidden.
Yes, but his body...
I would like to return the body to my brother.
It's too high a price to pay for a human's transmutation.
I understand your feelings,
but it's a matter that only God can afford.
Then why did you discuss transmutation of a man in your letter?
I must admit,
we had a youthful problem.
Mr. Majihal,
I made a rose jam.
Please, help yourself.
You're always so kind to me, Levi.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Do you want anything else?
No, I'm sorry.
Okay, be careful.
I heard that you're having a holiday soon.
Yes, it's the holiday of the dead.
They take souls of the dead
and bring them back to heaven.
I've heard about your village.
They say that the dead resurrect and attack the locals.
Is there any connection here?
It's just pure water.
I have a lot of guests today.
It's you!
Hey, Kruze!
Mr. Majihal, please forgive us.
Here's more.
Why should I apologize?
These weaklings are to blame,
even though they're boys.
What?
Calm down.
Klaus,
I understand that you feel bad
because your older sister died,
but you've always been such a kind girl.
What would she say if she saw you now?
Shut up!
Nobody understands anything.
Her sister didn't just die.
She was killed.
The woman who resurrected!
Resurrected?
Kruze!
Hey, wait!
Kruze!
What?
Alchemists?
Her older sister died half a year ago
for an unknown reason.
Her body was found by one of our residents.
It seemed she was just sleeping.
And in the evening,
right after the funeral...
Kruze!
Karin?
Father told me
that this woman had lived in our village for a long time.
Do you understand?
The deceased woman resurrected
and killed my older sister,
and not only her.
The rest is her own business.
Since you're alchemists,
help me avenge my sister.
I asked Madjihal,
but he didn't do anything.
That's why...
Of course Madjihal didn't do anything.
Just because he doesn't believe in these tales.
And I don't like to take part in revenge.
What are you saying?
You're just scared!
What kind of alchemists are you?
You're a scoundrel and a freak in armor!
Scoundrel?
A freak in armor?
Scoundrel?
Did you say a freak in armor?
I'm still growing!
You're still a freak in armor.
You can't see the size of a pea on the ground.
Shut up!
If you were a girl,
you'd at least act like a girl!
What does it have to do with me?
Karin?
Yes.
She used to live here.
She used to grow roses.
She was a beautiful girl.
But it's been 20 years since then.
That year she was able to grow blue roses,
which are very difficult to breed.
She had a great smile back then.
However,
she took her blue roses to the city
and...
On the mountain road
there was an accident,
but she fell off a cart and that's it.
They say that Karin attacks the locals.
That's impossible.
The dead don't resurrect.
And even if they did,
this girl wouldn't attack the locals.
Well, what do you think, Shed?
I agree that the dead don't come back.
But if someone was transmuting a person here,
only Majihal can do it in this village.
Did you hear that?
Huh? What?
Do you really want to do it?
Yeah.
We'll grab it with our own hands.
What? Drifted?
If we leave it like this,
then someone will be killed again.
Yeah.
What have you done, grandma?
I'm sorry.
It's decided. Tonight.
Do you agree?
Ed, wait!
What, Al?
What?
It's scary.
Not at all.
In fact, zombies don't exist either.
Don't talk nonsense.
If the rumors are true,
then it's no different than transmuting a person.
We must know for sure.
Ouch!
Got it!
We got it!
You're crushing me, Al!
So it's you!
There!
You're my sister!
Klaus!
This sound...
This alchemist Majihal...
He's just a second kind.
What's going on?
What's going on?
What's going on?
What's going on?
What's going on?
What?
What was I supposed to expect from Majihal?
I thought if there was a master Majihal,
he'd be able to handle the zombies.
What happened, brother?
It's not transmutating a person and not zombies.
It's the same.
It's the same.
I heard the same sound then.
Mr. Madjihal is angry. Don't wander around the house without asking.
Huh? And what do you want?
Ed?
It's...
Brother?
Ah!
Brother, how are you?
What? Have you come to your senses?
You have seen something that no one should see.
Of course. Zombie dolls.
You did it.
Me?
Connection of the soul.
To a doll that looks like Karin like two drops, you need to connect the soul of a village girl.
Then Karin will always be near.
But nothing came out of you.
It's hard to attach the soul to someone else's vessel for her.
And if you attach it, it doesn't work as it should.
Karin herself went out, wandered around the village.
Do you even understand what you have done? And for what?
Karin was the only woman I loved.
No matter how many years have passed since her death, the wounds on the soul did not heal.
And then I decided to bring her back to life with the help of alchemy.
But human transmutation is not for me.
I wanted to do at least something that resembled Karin.
That's what I thought.
You're crazy.
No. I just love Karin.
And you will help me.
For the sake of my love, attach her to the soul.
I will not.
I see. You are as stubborn as Goggenheim.
I just wanted to thank you.
Silly girl.
No! Run!
Please stop, Mr. Madjihal.
Shut up! It's none of your business!
Val, do something!
And a little more!
Blue Rose.
Take the soul of this girl and smile at me again.
Karin!
No! Don't!
Stop, Madjihal. You didn't understand anything.
What you needed was right next to everything.
What are you talking about?
I'm not talking. Karin didn't die.
After an accident, she lost her memory and lived in another place all this time.
Twenty years later, her memory returned and Karin came to you.
But you couldn't recognize her.
Madjihal, I...
Stupid. You want to say that this woman is Karin?
Karin was the most beautiful woman in the world.
Like a rose.
Look at the truth in your eyes.
The flowers are withering, but Karin's feelings for you have not changed.
Shut up!
And now, Slava, we will kill you!
Madjihal!
Madjihal!
No, you can't be Karin.
No!
Karin!
Karin!
Karin!
Karin!
Karin!
Karin!
Karin!
Karin!
I understand that alchemy can also push people on the wrong path.
Yes, that's right.
Hey!
Huh?
I'm sorry that I was so rude to you.
I'm sorry that I was so rude to you.
You turned out to be great alchemists.
Really?
Who are you?
It can't be.
Klaus?
What is this?
This clothes suits you much better!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
