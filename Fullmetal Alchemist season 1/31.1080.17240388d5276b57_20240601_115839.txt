They're just refugees, after all.
If there's a scar among them, it's not that simple.
Let it be so, but isn't it too much of an issue?
Are you criticizing the administration, Feldfebel Fury?
No, no, what are you...
Our goal is to get rid of the scar.
Probably, there will be no resistance.
And what if there is resistance?
Well, before we were sent here,
we received information that some bandits
under the guise of military men attacked Naishvartsev.
Currently, people there don't trust the army too much.

This drawing...
When a person wants to get something,
he needs to sacrifice something.
In this way, if you want to get something,
you have to give something equal in return.
In alchemy, this is called the law of equal exchange.
At that time, we believed that this is the truth that rules the world.

You, Zolov J. Kimbley, are you alive?
Kimbley?
Bogrov alchemist.
State alchemist?
You should have been shot long ago
for systematic violation of orders in Ishvar.
Say it straight.
Without a doubt, both women and children
are a slap in the face of my bosses.
Bah!
I can't wait to see what happens next.
Bah!
I was looking forward to the death penalty,
but for some reason I was left alive.
Why?
I don't know.
Maybe that gentleman knows.
Hmm?
How should I know?
How long are you going to endure this disgrace in the headquarters?
Take everyone. Arrest immediately.
Yes, sir.
Teacher!
You're a fool after all.
Wait, please, teacher.
Come on, Al.
A mole.
He's definitely a homunculus.
Well, see you later.
Wait!
Powerful transformation.
But all who raise their hands on the Fuhrer
will be subjected to me
with the help of the ultimate art of abseiling.
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
You underestimate me.
I've already seen such muscles.
Even more beautiful.
If we don't stop them quickly,
the building will collapse.

Hey, wait! Are you going to make a bomb out of me?
Can't I?
You can't!
The steel man said it was his arm and leg?
Yes.
It seems like you got through the gate with your own strength.
What? The gate?
Wait. From now on, you're not alone anymore.
Here, eat this.
Come on.
Try it.
There are hundreds of human lives in them.
Humans?
So what? It's not tasty?
Then you can't do anything.
Let them catch you, give them your arm and leg.
You're using alchemy.
Looks like it's thanks to this arm and leg.
Listen, we were raised on these rocks.
We're not humans, we're homunculi.
And since you can eat it, you're not human either.
We have to be greedy after all.
We can't do it like this.
Okay, I'll just blow up this building and that's it.
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.
I'm Lieutenant Colonel Frank Archer, the Red Alchemist.
Hello.
I suppose the Fuhrer knows what you're doing here.
Or was it the decision of one Basco Grano?
I don't know.
Do you intend to return to the army?
I can arrange that.
Teacher! Teacher!
That bastard just scratched me!
Major?
It hurts.
It's not surprising.
She's the teacher of the Ehrlich brothers.
Thank you, Major.
I thought it would end like this.
Hold on to the other side.
Oh, no. He's already...
Come on, go.
Do what you want.
Ed, I don't think the teacher is here anymore.
Damn it. Is she in such a state?
Why is she so concerned about this child?
You two go south, the rest follow me.
Let's go. We broke in illegally.
The colonel will be in trouble.
What did you say? Check again.
Well? Is everything all right with the Fuhrer?
We contacted the central headquarters.
They said the Fuhrer didn't plan to inspect the southern region.
What nonsense? I saw it myself.
Did you arrest the Ehrlich brothers and that woman?
No. I decided that the security of the semi-destroyed headquarters is more important.
That's why I came back.
Major.
All right.
They have nowhere else to go except for the army.
Just in case, look for the Fuhrer again.
Yes, sir.
Please tell us.
We're worried about them.
Besides, if this child is a homunculus,
then we don't know what he can do.
The place of transmutation of a person.
Izumi lost her child, and in order to revive him,
she performed a human transmutation.
How do you know?
After all ...
Now she's there.
I think so.
The place that the teacher chose,
where she wouldn't hurt anyone and where no one would come.
The island of Yok.
Did I guess right?
Ouch!
My boy!
What is it?
Hurry up!
Or I'll kill you.
Teacher!
Teacher!
Teacher!
Teacher!
Teacher!
Teacher!
Teacher!
Izumi!
Teacher!
Stop!
Teacher!
Hold on!
Stop!
Leave him.
Teacher!
But he tried to hurt you!
I was going to kill him.
Although I was supposed to die.
Why?
I created him.
Using the remains of the child and other components,
I tried to perform a human transmutation.
And what happened?
Not a human.
Coming to my senses, I found myself in front of the gates.
Ed, what did you see on the other side of the gate?
The whole essence of alchemy.
It seemed to me that all the knowledge of the world flowed inside me.
There was ... truth.
Truth.
And it seemed to me that it was hell.
There I left this child.
Ah!
Maybe he has nothing to do with that child?
I understood everything at first glance.
If he had grown up, he would have been exactly the same age.
And if the homunculus had appeared here, then it must have been mine.
The homunculus is an artificial human.
Someone created.
Created?
Do you know exactly how homunculi appear?
No, of course not.
Probably in the same place as the fifth laboratory.
Created as chimeras.
It's not ...
When people like you, destroyed people,
transmute a human,
as a result, an imperfect creature with body and mind appears.
But without a soul.
You call them homunculi.
Really?
How do you know that?
Envy helped me to remember it.
Envy? You met this type?
Yes.
Envy and all the rest were born long ago thanks to one fool who transmuted a human.
That's why they all want to become human.
Finally!
Let's go.
Hello, hello, Absolute Shield.
Yes, Absolute.
Did you like it when you were called a monster?
I made fun of you for centuries, but it seems that you have not learned anything.
Well, forgive me for that.
My struts are old.
And what did you do with the skull?
Of course, I broke it into pieces.
That's how you hid it somewhere.
When I find it, I'll beat you up again.
Do you think I'll let you?
It looks like your new friends are here.
It doesn't concern you.
No, I still want to live.
And for that I need company.
I'm late.
Envy?
Envy?
That someone was born with such a name?
We have a new passion.
That is, in some century we gathered all seven worlds.
I'm glad to meet you, Envy.
It's a great honor to meet you.
I'm greedy, but I'm not a fool.
And I don't want to fight you two at once.
We'll deal with them later.
Where is the anger?
Now, probably, with the rest of the boys.
Why did you do it?
We wanted to use the anger as a bait
to direct the brothers in search of the stone.
I wanted to see the distorted face of the steel boy
and the child of this Gogenheim.
I remembered everything.
On the other side of the gate, I just had to wait.
Just wait and wait and wait.
My body grew a little.
And somehow one idiot came.
This idiot came to the gates and left his hand and leg.
He was screaming something like,
Give me back my brother!
So I took my hand and leg.
Then it took some more time
and I was able to open the gate.
And finally I went outside.
It's not true.
Thank you for your hand and leg.
Thank you for my imperfect life.
No matter how much I hate you,
my hatred is not enough to express my gratitude to you.
Well, now give me your whole body.
And then I will become a human.
It hurts.
I don't need your body.
Ed, if you don't do this, I'll do it.
Al, wait, he's...
My right hand and left leg belong to Ed.
He lost them for me.
Al, we have made such a long way.
We have made such a long way.
Al, we have made such a long way
to get them back.
Thank you.
