Means the police will play Railroad Attack!
Bureau of Investigation
That was a must-see for Roy Mustang!
What is it?
It's better to understand the daily routine of work.
And we're entrusting you with a secret task â€“ to watch over him.
So, young Lieutenant Hewok is watching over Colonel Mustang?
Yes. But I can't handle this task alone.
So, I'm asking you to help me.
Saturday, 9.46, Colonel Mustang was sitting with the papers
that had to be handed over by noon.
He directly stated that he was tired of this job.
Then, at 10.26, the colonel was trying to feed the dog of Lieutenant Hawkeye.
Then, at 11.03, the colonel suddenly began to wash the window.
I wonder, what about the papers that had to be handed over?
Then, at 11.47, the colonel, shouting that he had no time,
began to sign the papers, although there was still a lot of time.
After noon, the colonel went out into the city to check the fire services,
and then received a letter from a girl from a flower shop.
Apparently, it was an invitation to a date.
I saw tickets to the theater.
The colonel began to get ready to go home,
saying that on the way he would go to the city hall,
where he had to take the papers.
But it was clear from his face that he had a date.
Wait, the girl from the store is Grace.
She's been so cold to me lately.
Have you met her?
You won't be jealous if you get in touch with the colonel.
My condolences. Stop it.
Shut up!
Can you understand my feelings?
It's your own fault that you were abandoned.
Shut up! You're worse off without you!
Who would say?
So you won't fight?
Why are you so? It's better to make up.
It's all my fault!
I can't go on like this anymore!
When a person wants to get something,
he needs to sacrifice something.
Here, in the headquarters,
brave soldiers were ready to sacrifice themselves for the sake of the world.
This is a story about the courage and friendship of the fiery alchemist,
colonel Roy Mustang and his subordinates.

Oh, Hayate.
How nice of you.
No sufferings.
What's going on with the junior lieutenant Hewok?
It seems that his heart is broken again.
That's it.
The army service leaves little free time.
It's probably difficult to find a girl.
What a pity.
A real man should have time to work with women.
Actually, it's your fault.
However, if you leave everything like that,
the work will suffer.
Hey, guys, introduce Hewok to some girl.
She's a girl.
She's a girl.
Hey, guys, introduce Hewok to some girl.
Don't make it impossible for us.
I'd like to be introduced to girls.
Why don't you just share one of your own, colonel?
What?
Nothing.
Does any of you know Hewok's taste in women's relationships?
When we were drinking with the junior lieutenant,
he asked if I knew any cheerful,
graceful and beautiful girl.
Good, warrant officer Farman.
Get a cheerful, graceful and beautiful girl
and introduce her to Hewok.
I have to get her.
This is a mission.
A mission for me?
I need all the documents
on the case of Brigadier General Baska Gran,
Dr. Mark and Schotaker,
plus all the records on the fifth lab
and the second prison. Got it?
Got it.
And those who burned in the central library?
Of course.
That's why I called you.
How can I get into the court again
and investigate the case
of Brigadier General Hughes in more detail?
I don't hear an answer.
Yes, I'll take it.
I didn't go through any preparation
to get the girls.
What can I do?
Oh, sorry.
Are you all right?
Cheska?
warrant officer Farman?
Long time no see. How are you?
I'm fine.
Not bad.
By the way,
Cheska, I'm looking for a cheerful,
graceful, beautiful girl.
Do you have anyone in mind?
Do I have anyone in mind?
That means I'm not a cheerful, graceful
and not a beautiful girl.
No, I didn't mean that.
Colonel Mustang ordered me to find a girlfriend
for the junior Lieutenant Hewok.
A girlfriend?
Maybe you know who?
Oh, I have a great idea.
Younger sister of Major Armstrong?
She's old enough,
but she doesn't have a girlfriend
because she's shy.
Wow!
No, I'd better go home.
You're lucky.
It's the biggest chance in your life.
I wish I could get married.
Your career will go smoothly.
I've never seen her before.
What kind of person is she?
Major Armstrong claims that she's beautiful
and that she looks like him.
Younger sister looks like Major?
I want to go home.
Welcome, Junior Lieutenant Hewok.
We've been waiting for you.
Come on, hold on.
In the course of 180 years
the Armstrong family played a key role
in the political and financial
life of our country.
From generation to generation
and literally from the crowd
they supported the law and order
in the state,
which made us one of the most famous
families.
And I myself, as a general,
always listen to my father.
They are always wonderful.
Dear,
why are you giving your guests
your tail?
Oh, mother.
Mother?
I'm lucky.
Mother seems to be normal.
Oh, well,
nothing normal.
Wait.
So, father in width,
mother in height.
If you multiply them mathematically,
you get this son.
This means that the younger sister
should be...
Try to catch me!
It's not necessary
that the features of both parents
should remain.
There is a chance that she will look more like one of them.
Well, Junior Lieutenant, here's my sister.
Oh, Catherine,
don't be shy, come in.
Who is she?
Father? Mother?
I don't like either.
But with such a choice,
it would be better to be a mother!
Excuse me.
Nice to meet you.
I'm Catherine
Ellie Armstrong.
No one? Hooray!
Well, is it really beautiful?
It looks like me.
Why?
Well, eyelashes?
Go, Catherine, don't be shy.
Oh, okay.
Catherine, what are you interested in?
I'm a little bit
of a pianist.
What a cutie!
Can't she be the younger sister of this major?
I'm a little bit
raising him.
What is it, Junior Lieutenant?
I refuse to say
100% of his sister.
However,
I don't want to exclude
her incredible power,
her style,
appearance,
position.
Everything is fine, it's the spring of my life!
Catherine?
Yes?
If you don't mind,
would you like to meet with me?
What?
Oh,
Heather?
Yes?
Actually,
actually,
I like
men like my brother.
You are not in my taste,
so it's better to think
that there was no conversation.
What a pity!
Hey, what's wrong with you?
10,000 that he will sit in a puddle.
10,000 that he will be rejected.
Then 30,000 that the contract is revoked.
I hope you are joking.
We are serious.
And why did I come here?
Yes, Major Armstrong
turned out to be the man I expected.
Lieutenant Hawkeye,
can you set up the networks?
Yes.
My God, I want to eat so much!
I haven't eaten since I argued
all the time without lunch.
And when I won,
I ate from my belly.
Then I'm sorry, give me something to eat.
Then what was the point of betting?
They didn't fix it.
And the place.
I have goosebumps.
They say there is a ghost here.
What is it?
It can't be.
It's him!
Don't.
I told you, that's enough.
It tickles.
It's...
Ugh!
Ugh!
Sit.
The paw.
The other.
Lie.
Eat.
Good morning, Lieutenant.
Good morning.
Is it true?
It's true.
The rumors have been confirmed.
What a horror!
I'm afraid to go out in the evening.
What happened?
We saw the 13th warehouse again.
Nonsense.
It's not nonsense, colonel.
It's true.
It's very scary.
13th warehouse.
There should be only 12 warehouses in total.
They say that the 13th one appears from time to time.
Where this warehouse appears,
there used to be a place for execution.
And at night,
where there should be only 12 warehouses,
the 13th one appears.
And the ghost of the executed
is there,
rumbling with bones,
digging the ground with love.
Stupid.
You were scared by this story.
Your fear made you
take the warehouse.
Something else.
Colonel, aren't you scared?
Of course not.
Alchemists are scientists.
Our job is to look at everything from a scientific point of view.
But not only we saw it.
The headquarters is noisy.
Don't you understand?
Aren't you ashamed?
You are military.
I will teach those who listen to all kinds of rumors
the truth.
Really?
That's great.
So the colonel will take part in our night operation.
Great.
There is nothing to be afraid of with the colonel.
Hey, wait.
What are we talking about?
Tonight we are going to find out the truth about the ghost.
And the colonel will tell us how to find out the truth.
I said so, but...
I'm so scared to go back to the barracks in the evenings.
Please help, colonel.
What nonsense?
Why should I go with them when they are brave enough?
Everyone loves you so much, colonel.
Why should I be happy about your love?
If you are so afraid of your own ideas,
then how can you, soldiers,
be able to resist living people?
I didn't ask you to stop.
But apparently you wanted to.
Oh, colonel Bustank.
I'm sorry to have disturbed you without warning.
I was just passing by and...
Thank you for coming by.
Elisya, say hello.
Hi, Elisya.
How are you?
Well...
Come in.
I'll make some tea.
Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
But I still have work to do.
Please excuse me.
As I said,
to resist living people
is much scarier.
That's perfect.
Nothing came out.
Did you leave any other materials
with them?
Okay.
Burn all these materials
so that there is no ashes left.
What? This is official documentation.
It doesn't matter.
The fifth lab was closed.
Is it normal
that there are no records left?
We couldn't find anything at all.
It's strange that after the lab
there are no documents left.
Someone allowed the negligence
to perform the duties.
Brigadier General Gran,
I can't say it's negligence.
There are no records.
There is evidence
that they were ordered to be destroyed.
Of course, I suppose
that Mr. Chancellor is not aware of this.
The creation of chemistry
on the basis of people
and the increase in alchemical power
with the help of a philosophical stone
is a powerful weapon.
But you know that it's forbidden.
Science goes
through trial and error.
We can't use the experience of the past
just because it's dangerous.
It's stupid.
Now, under my command,
Zolov-Kimble and Schottaker
only need to give an order.
The civil war
broke out in Leor again.
Besides, we got information
that there is a scar hidden there.
I hope you can handle it.
Yes.
What nonsense.
Adults are hunting for ghosts.
It's really scary.
We're so glad you're with us.
We're going to investigate the houses.
Huh?
The lights are out.
What does the Department of Commerce do?
It's too much work.
This should help.
It's just a shadow, idiot.
Feldfebel Fury.
You can play like this with the shadows.
Look at this cute dog.
Stop scaring me.
It's scary.
Say whatever you want, but I want to go home.
What kind of subordinate am I?
Follow me.
I'll prove to you that ghosts don't exist.
Don't throw us away, colonel.
This is the 12th warehouse.
And behind it is just a desert.
Look.
Where is the 13th warehouse?
We came here in a crowd.
Stop it.
Look. There is the 13th.
There.
The letter V
looks like the 13th.
Maybe you just didn't see it?
You were wrong in the dark.
I was scared.
It's just that we shouldn't have picked them up.
I see. It turned out to be very simple.
What about ghosts?
That's good.
Now I can walk around here.
Okay, let's go.
As soon as I calmed down,
I wanted to go right away.
Let's go back and have a late dinner.
Today you treat me.
What? I don't have money.
I had nothing to make noise.
Stop.
What's there?
Look here.
What is it?
Someone was digging here.
What is it?
What is it?
It's a bone.
A ghost at the execution site.
They really exist.
Quiet.
Even if there were executions here,
no one was buried here.
Someone illegally left it
at the execution site.
The criminal will not
specifically bury the body on military territory.
So someone from the military did it?
Maybe.
But I don't exclude the possibility
that this is a soldier's bone.
First of all,
we need to find out who the victim is.
Don't miss anything.
Maybe he's buried in parts.
Search all suspicious places.
Yes!
Aha.
I just thought of something.
Who did this mess?
What happened?
Nothing.
Yes?
Colonel,
the Tiger is hunting.
We'll be looking forward to
good news.
May I speak to you?
What?
Please allow me to join
the Eastern Expedition.
Lead the expedition?
Yes, sir.
What is it?
I don't know.
What is it?
It's about the expedition.
Major Armstrong will lead the expedition.
Having been wounded in the battle
at Ishvar,
the Major left the front line.
I believe that the Major,
who did not achieve any results last time,
should not be entrusted with command.
Since I served in the Eastern Staff,
I believe that I am not responsible
for what is happening.
Please allow me to join.
I have no objections.
Good.
Colonel Roy Mustang,
I recommend you to the troops
to suppress the rebellion.
Thank you for your honor.
