        <pre>What's the matter? It's too late.
Something is bothering me.
If you're talking about Schramm, then no.
Or you're talking about Marco, who was taken under the protection of the Fuhrer.
It's the same, but the main thing is...
I haven't been seen in a TV series for a long time.
Idiot, he would know what's going on here.
Maybe it's worth reporting about everything to Colonel Mustang?
Hmm.
About the Feurik brothers.
Hmm.
About the Feurik brothers.
If to report, then not now.
I have people I was going to send to the library tomorrow.
From them there will be more trouble than from me.
Then we...
I, under my responsibility, order you to inspect the abandoned building of the fifth laboratory.
And be ready for troubles.
Yes!
Ah!
I hate this place!
Long time no see, baby.
It's been four years since I met you for the first time.
What?
That evening there was a beautiful fireworks.
Who are you?
He said that homunculi.
But this can not be.
That's how. Why?
Homunculi are artificial creatures that are not human at all.
But no one has yet been able to create a homunculi.
This is impossible.
No, nothing is impossible.
Because at the moment in front of me is only the soul of the boy.
Not a human.
You can eat.
Ah!
When a person wants to get something, he needs to sacrifice something.
Thus, if you want to get something, you must give something equal in return.
In alchemy, this is called the law of equal exchange.
At that time, we believed that this is the truth that rules the world.
The law of equal exchange.

Exramer
I understand what researches were going on under allçš„
A large-scaleAAAA
Alchemical realization in military settings
And especially researches related
with transmutation of living beings
With the help of this incomplete philosophical stone.
You'll probably be able to finish it.
Did you know how to make it?
No. When I was brought here, the raw material was already prepared.
Probably my predecessor, Dr. Marco, left it.
He was responsible for the research.
It doesn't matter what it's made of.
Even if people used it as a raw material, can you return them the old life?
It is much more important to complete the stone.
I would agree.
You would.
In this state, their lives make no sense.
But...
Does it really make no sense?
It can't be.
There must be no sense in your life.
You're working overtime in such a hurry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
You're working overtime in such a hurry.
Mr. Fuhrer, I'm sorry for the noise.
It has nothing to do with the fifth laboratory.
Rumors have been around for a long time, but I didn't pay attention to them,
because Brigadier General Gran used it for military purposes.
But since we're talking about the lives of two young alchemists, it's a completely different matter.
I assign the major a detachment and go there myself.
Perhaps you won't make it there alone.
Yes, sir!
Where's the man with the scar?
I dropped it.
I see.
Okay.
But greed can get in the way.
We need to hurry up the rest of the kids.
This place is just above the alchemical circle.
It is a reservoir for the supply of the energy of the Philosopher's Stone to the lower chamber.
Okay.
I can use it.
Yes, after all, no matter how many centuries have passed, people do not change.
What kind of guy is he?
Is he also from the military?
Do you still think that this man is Brigadier General Basque Gran
and his superiority will not be affected?
Are you going to transmute simultaneously in two rooms?
Yes.
There is not enough Philosopher's Stone in this room.
And Mark's research recommended using two alchemical circles.
Philosopher's Stone on top and Philosopher's Stone on the bottom.
Philosopher's Stone on top and Philosopher's Stone on the bottom
will be connected using two alchemical circles.
And I will squeeze them.
To clean them, you need explosive compression.
And I will change the circles too.
I see the cryptogram in the alchemical circle for the first time.
I think that if I manage to create a Philosopher's Stone,
I will return it to its form, and then we will disappear.
Then you can do whatever you want.
I will admit it, Helen.
Let me out!
Is anybody here?
Will you shut up?
Why are you acting so calm?
There you are.
It seems that you were an alchemist, a famous killer of allies.
But you can't do anything here.
And do you know why I'm here?
Because I'm here to help you.
Because I'm here to help you.
Because I'm here to help you.
And do you know why I was called the killer of allies?
You exploded your allies with a bomb.
A bomb?
Why would I need them?
Most of the human body consists of water,
but it also contains metal particles.
If you use their structure and some amount of alkali,
you can easily create explosive substances.
And when we are loaded with so much red water,
even my strength...
Why are there people here?
Did the investigators stay here except for you?
They are dressed in prison robes.
Why are they...
If I had done the transmutation, I wouldn't know about it.
Hey, you! Who brought you here?
It's me, Steel Alchemist.
According to my order, the prisoners were transferred here from the second prison.
And you are here with his permission.
It's dangerous.
Brigadier General is dead.
Right in front of me.
Who are you?
Nice to meet you, Steel Alchemist.
I'm glad you came here.
Just kidding.
You won't get away with this.
You want to fight me?
I hate fights.
Shut up!
Go to hell!
You don't know what you are stuck in.
Don't you understand who you are fighting with?
You are alive only because he told us to leave you alive.
And I don't forgive you.
I will never forgive you.
His blood flows in you.
Envy.
Envy.
Envy.
Envy.
It's all because you didn't check the raw material properly.
But...
You don't want it to be even worse.
Then let's continue the transmutation.
You made a mistake.
But the raw material is still there.
These prisoners are the raw material for the Philosopher's Stone.
You wanted to make me do this from the very beginning.
I don't think you can do it.
Paul!
Ed.
These are...
homunculi.
It can't be.
That's right.
They are homunculi.
Perfectly artificial people.
They promised to tell me their secret.
Then Nina will live.
What's the point in reviving only the form?
There will be no soul of Nina in it.
As for the soul, it is right here.
Nina lives in my memories.
If these memories are revived by Nina's homunculi,
it will be born perfectly.
The best Nina I can create.
Revive memories?
But it won't be Nina!
That's enough talking.
What's the rest?
Let's start transmutation.
First, fix the ceiling.
I'm so tired of it.
We can't use alchemy.
We have to ask someone all the time.
You can't use alchemy?
Then why the Philosopher's Stone?
And this story with Cornelius?
A fool, possessed by the magic of greatness
that wants to turn the whole world upside down.
We want to become people.
Nothing more.
If you're really a homunculi,
you must be an alchemist who created you.
Can't he make the Philosopher's Stone?
Nobody created us!
We were born!
All we can do is to trick people
and push the person who needs the Philosopher's Stone
to his creation.
Wait a minute.
You told Magvar how to use red water.
And you taught Marko and Tucker
so much in this lab.
You gave the False Philosopher's Stone to Cornelius
in the city of Leor.
All this attracts fools
who are interested in the Philosopher's Stone.
So we found you too, little Edward.
You planned my coming here.
It can't be.
Sal and I came here on our own.
We made a long way and finally got here.
Because we wanted it.
We're not some puppets.
It's the same.
I'll tell you how to make the Philosopher's Stone.
And you'll make us people
with the Stone.
I can't believe it.
You don't believe us.
We don't ask you.
It's an order.
Because a attached soul,
if you do it like this...
Wait, you bastard!
Edward Elric, it's me!
Edward!
It's just...
Stop!
Wait!
Don't touch my brother!
Don't touch him!
Edward!
Edward, let me go!
I'm just...
It's fake love.
And if you're not real,
then what?
Shut up!
Edward!
Brother, wait!
Are you serious?
You're a fool.
You should have brought him back to God.
He's a kid.
He'll make it.
Edward, stop!
Edward, stop!
Edward, stop!
These are people!
That's right.
So what?
I don't want to restore my appearance
if I have to sacrifice people for that.
Didn't you learn the lesson
after you tried to resurrect your mother?
Nothing is good for the transmutation of a person
except the life of another person.
In order for a person to live,
it is necessary to sacrifice something.
All adults know this.
But we...
You didn't have a choice
before you were called an army dog.
You entered the world of adults
with this decision.
So you shouldn't become a child
only when you feel like it.
Is this the truth
that hides behind the truth?
Yes?
Edward,
don't you ever do this again.
Edward,
don't do it.
Edward,
don't do it.
Edward,
don't do it.
Edward,
don't do this.
I'm sorry, Al.
After all, I...
Steel Alchemist!
Take your brother and leave!
Don't get in!
The elder brother must protect the younger one!
It will be bad if it all ends here.
It will be bad if it all ends here.
It will be bad if it all ends here.
Steel Alchemist is so powerful...
The group at the back gate is ready!
The surrounding territory is complete!
I repeat, protect the huge armor and the boy with the scythe!
Arrest anyone who may become a soldier!
And the rest?
Destroy!
Forward!
To the right!
Inside!
It can't be!
Steel Alchemist!
Edward!
Edward!
The reaction of these brothers came out under control!
One!
Mother...

My brother wanted to tell me a long time ago, but he didn't dare.
Maybe it's...
