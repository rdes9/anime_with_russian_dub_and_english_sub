Teacher!
Teacher!
Ouch!
Ow!
No!
This hand is in my way!
Let's get rid of all unnecessary...
...of stupid mechanical parts!
What is it about?
Give me everything!
Everything else!
You!
Ow!
Ow, don't!
Ow!
Ed!
You said that homunculi can't use alchemy!
But it's not the case with him!
I understand his secret!
By creating a circle with the right hand and the left leg...
...he can turn the surface of his body into another matter!
He can change his body...
...because he is a homunculi!
But he can use alchemy...
...because...
Because he has...
...a hand and a leg of Ed!
These are mine!
Give them back!
These belong to Ed!
These are the brother's hand and leg!
Give them back!
Give them back!
Ow!
That's it!
Ed!
Al, stop!
Stop, at last!
What are you saying?
He is not a human homunculi!
Ah!
But he is...
...he is with Izumi!
So...
You want to take my hand?
This is my hand!
You got something in exchange for this leg, didn't you?
And you paid for the younger brother with this hand!
And what will you pay for...
...taking away my hand and leg?
Equal!
Shut up!
Ah!
Ed!
When a person wants to get something...
...he needs to sacrifice something.
So, if you want to get something...
...you have to give something equal in exchange.
In alchemy...
...it is called the law of equal exchange.
At that time we believed...
...that this is the truth that rules the world.
The End
The End
The End
Teacher!
Ed!
Al!
I forbid you to get involved in this case!
This child is my sin!
I...
Teacher!
Stop!
Vinlin!
Take care of the teacher!
Hey, wait!
Ed!
Al!
Steel Alchemist!
I heard that on this island...
...you used to study...
Ed!
It's a woman!
FÃ¼hrer!
Why are you here?
I'm looking for the same thing as you.
Homunculi?
It seems that's how they call themselves.
By the way...
...do you know why homunculi are born?
Where do they come from?
They are called homunculi.
Where do homunculi come from?
Where do they come from?
According to the legend...
...homunculi are born...
...as a result of...
...failure of human transmutation.
By the way...
...your father wrote about it in his works.
I don't care...
...about him.
Well, it doesn't matter.
However, if the boy...
...who was found by Colonel Archer...
...turns out to be a homunculi...
...it means that someone...
...was transmuting a human.
No matter what the reason is...
...human transmutation is forbidden.
Do you know who created it?
Maybe it's better to find the escaped homunculi?
Our subordinates are already pursuing it.
I'm sorry, but I don't know.
And we're in a hurry.
Ed.
I can't tell them about the teacher.
Dan.
Well, how do you feel...
...when you carry it?
Nothing special.
Anger?
Are all the seven of us together?
Maybe we'll go to him in some time.
Fortunately, it's not far away...
...and besides, we have to tell them about greed.
Why about greed?
Because he created greed a long time ago.
Why?
Why did you tell my brother?
Because he understood everything I told him.
I gave him the ancient knowledge of the people of Ishvara.
Because of this, my brother...
You shouldn't forget...
...that he and others live right here...
...many lives.
They're here!
Here!
Because of the inevitable circumstances...
...we were forced to leave...
...the area of residence established for us.
As a leader, I take full responsibility.
Do you know that a new residence has been prepared for you in the South?
Everyone will take you there.
Talk to your people...
...so that we don't have any resistance.
Okay.
But first, we have to check everyone without exception.
Personally.
Are you looking for someone here?
Let's begin.
Be careful.
I saw the serial killer from the headquarters.
I saw an announcement about the search in the house...
...in which I was previously sheltered.
It's good if you didn't recognize each other.
Mom!
Hey, you!
Where is he?
Where is that criminal with the scar?
There's no point in hiding him!
Hey!
Quiet! Quiet!
Just dare to do something to us!
The army will...
Who shot?
I didn't hear the shot.
Psh!
Psh!
Psh!
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot, you idiots!
He's alive!
Everyone, calm down!
Who raised his hand at this man?
What?
You're not going to stop repeating the cut?
We're fine with that.
Right.
So what?
Are we going to keep quiet?
Enough of this nonsense!
Our people have been killed!
Get out of here!
Get out of here!
Right, get out of here!
Bye!
I'll take care of it.
Cover me.
Colonel!
What's the matter?
I told you to cover me.
And get out of here.
It's better for you.
Yes, sir!
Well, you're different.
You're both teachers and students.
Ed, Al,
I have to finish this.
You're no longer my students.
I didn't teach you alchemy
so that you could get to this state.
I don't want to see such horrible fights anymore.
Go away.
Thank you for everything.
Get well soon.
Can you really leave like this?
I have to go.
Guys!
Well, good-bye.
Yes.
Come closer.
But...
We were kicked out of the school.
Yes.
You fools!
The fact that you're no longer my students
means that now you can talk to her
on equal terms.
Exactly!
This means that nothing will
make you shy.
Exactly.
We're coming back.
Try to survive.
Teacher,
we came here to get your advice
on how to get our bodies back.
We won't leave without an answer.
Out!
We won't leave.
We don't need a way
to sacrifice human life.
We want to find a real
philosophical stone.
Go away.
We won't leave.
I'll kill you.
Do whatever you want.
But we won't leave.
Maybe we can
bring this child back
to the other side of the gate.
This child is my sin.
So I can't teach you anything.
We have the same sin.
Idiots.
Are you following the brothers?
Yes, sir.
Be very vigilant.
If anything happens,
report to me immediately.
Yes, sir.
The Eureka brothers again?
You can't do anything.
The central office reported
that the Fuhrer had come to the south
and carried out an investigation
on the Homunculi case.
This is in line with what
I was told yesterday.
If the investigation
on the Homunculi case
continues,
then I have to get all the information
that the brothers have.
And it is possible that
these chemists will appear again.
And our Kimble.
Let's go.
We're in the wrong place.
Greed.
Lao and the rest,
return to the Devil's nest.
Are you going somewhere
alone?
I just don't like
one thing.
Wow!
That's how.
The Atheist didn't even
notice us.
We're in the wrong place.
Greed.
Lao and the rest,
return to the Devil's nest.
Are you going
or not?
You don't remember anything
about that side of the Gate?
I can't remember anything.
Maybe the body and memories
of Lao are still
on that side.
How can we
bring them back?
If we use
Philosopher's Stone,
we will be able to
break the law
of equal exchange
and open the Gate again.
Equal exchange,
you say?
Ed,
do you believe that?
To get something, you have to pay an equal price.
And this is applicable not only to alchemy, but to the entire universe.
Yes. That child lost his life before he was born.
What did he get in return?
No matter how you look at it, I can't get a good teacher.
Mason!
Yes?
Tell the guys about Dante's house.
They come to pick up my medicine in the morning.
Or did you want to live here for nothing?
I wonder what kind of person Dante is.
Mason says he's a famous pharmacist.
Ed, I'm worried about something.
If homunculus is born as a result of a failed attempt at human transmutation...
Come on, Al, let's hurry.
Excuse me.
We were expecting you. Dante is waiting for you inside.
You...
Lila!
I'm sorry for my unworthy behavior.
What are you doing here?
I'm sorry, Dante. I really wanted to become a great alchemist.
It's my dream.
Is Dante an alchemist?
Yes.
It's because of you.
You taught me something important.
Has your character changed?
Come in.
I brought them.
I was waiting for you, Elric's brothers.
Are you Mrs. Dante?
Yes.
Are you the student of Izumi?
I've heard about you.
Let me prepare the medicine.
So our teacher is...
Yes.
She studied alchemy here a long time ago.
Really?
Yes.
Our teacher's teacher?
It seems so.
Wow, I'm so lucky.
I just came to visit my old friends.
Well, now I won't let them go.
Are you serious?
You're talking to a state alchemist between us?
Hey, greed is calling us.
He needs help.
Think about it properly.
Dante, why did you decide to become an alchemist?
Maybe it's banal.
But I wanted to be useful to people.
People need alchemy.
But you can't do anything with its help.
Alchemy can help those who make an effort.
If someone tries to be happy,
he wants to be rewarded for his efforts.
That's what I thought.
Equal exchange?
That's right.
If you put effort into one,
you'll only get one.
That's the absolute truth.
Dante, what do you think about the Philosopher's Stone?
Are you looking for the Philosopher's Stone too?
No.
We...
Those who are looking for the Philosopher's Stone
are causing trouble for themselves.
Maybe it's too early for people to have the Philosopher's Stone.
You do look alike.
Your father, Hagenheim the Enlightened,
was looking for the Philosopher's Stone all his life.
Our father?
You know where your father is.
I don't even want to know.
Ed!
They broke up.
Here.
Follow the plan.
Ready?
Go!
Excellent.
Is that you?
Oh, you!
Dante!
Are you surprised?
I'm an absolute shield.
Lila?
Lila!
Don't move.
If you don't resist,
I'll kill you.
Dante!
Good afternoon.
Who are you?
The kidnappers.
The kidnappers?
Alfonso Ulrich.
I'm sorry, but you'll have to come with us.
But the teacher told me
that you can't leave with strangers.
Are you stupid?
How old are you?
Fourteen.
Fourteen years.
It's time to think with your own head.
Come on.
If you're a man, you decide.
And act yourself.
How much can you say?
A teacher is a teacher.
So I have to think on my own?
That's right.
If you understand, let's go with us.
That's what happened as a result
of self-thinking.
Go with strangers.
Hmm.
Let's fight.
Let's go.
Let's go.
