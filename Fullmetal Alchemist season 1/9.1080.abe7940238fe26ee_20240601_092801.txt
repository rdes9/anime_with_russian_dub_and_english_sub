This is Al, faster, faster!
I would like a set of screwdrivers with polystyrene powder,
hydraulic wrench, this micrometer,
and also a drill with a hard-sanding tip and a hammer.
Here in the center is a real tool store.
This is not the sort of equipment we have in Provincial.
What kind of material on the handle is so pleasant to squeeze in your hand?
Winry, are you buying anything else?
Aren't there too many hotels in the city?
What? But you said you would buy anything.
Aren't there, Ed?
Yes.
Oh, these are chrome-plated steel wedges.
They never rust and serve the table.
Maybe I'll buy this one too.
Uncle, can you give me a car oil as a bonus?
Of course.
Here, this is for you.
In my absence, take good care of the car armor.
Mr. Ellery, Lieutenant Colonel Mustang is calling for you.
A mission for me?
Yes. Since you are a state chemist, we will send you on a mission.
You need to be ready for this.
Young Lieutenant Hakai.
Yes, sir.
Orders and documents.
The rest is up to you.
Yes, sir.
Orders and documents.
To the steel chemist Edward Ellery.
As mentioned above, he is ordered to inspect the coal mines of Yusvel.
This is also the work of a state chemist.
We are studying the useful and excavated.
After all, chemists must know about the ore veins.
This is your first, quite simple task.
But this does not mean that you can work with your hands.
When a person wants to get something, he needs to sacrifice something.
Thus, if you want to get something, you must give something equal in return.
In alchemy, this is called the law of equal exchange.
At that time, we believed that this was the truth that ruled the world.
THE END
THE END
THE END
THE END
THE END
Everything looks so dull.
It doesn't look like there's anything to look at here.
Let's do a quick research and leave.
Oh, sorry.
Are you travelers?
Where did you come from?
What did you decide about food and nightlife?
Who are you?
Father, we have visitors.
What are you saying?
Guests! Guests! With stuffed wallets!
Wallets?
Welcome!
I'm Holling, the owner of the hotel.
Excuse me, it's a little dusty here.
The miners have a small salary.
That's why I work here.
I keep this hotel.
One night, two people, right?
How much does it cost to live here?
Expensive.
Don't worry.
Despite our appearance, we have enough money.
Two hundred thousand.
Two hundred thousand?!
What kind of stupid joke is that?
Who pays so much for the hotel?
This is the most fashionable Yusvel's hotel.
Are the prices the same in other places?
We haven't had a parking lot for a long time.
I would like to make more money.
Oh, it's not enough.
Too many gifts for Winry were bought.
You can't do anything, and if so, then ...
Cool!
As it was!
As if new.
Is there anything else to fix?
This can be fixed.
It's so expensive for me, I accidentally broke it.
What? You didn't throw it away like that.
You bought it for me.
And this rarely happens.
Okay, leave it to me.
How great!
I'm so glad.
There were no guests for a long time, and here are alchemists.
Look, the owner.
I used to play with alchemists too.
Hey!
Why did you come to Yusvel?
There is nothing to see here as tourists.
Work?
We came to check your shafts.
Check?
Are you from the military?
Actually, yes.
I'm a state alchemist.
Are you crazy?
I don't have food and shelter for an army dog.
Are you from the military too?
No.
He has nothing to do with me.
We met on the train.
Okay, then.
Let the dogs eat you.
How do you hate them?
Everyone hates the military terribly.
Here everyone is fed by Yoki, such a money rat and freak.
Yoki?
And now the state alchemist also came here.
Alchemists should serve the people.
This is the meaning of the work of an alchemist.
I was once taught this way.
Uncle?
I can't stand the guys who sold their soul to the army for privileges.
I'm so hungry.
Winry should also worry more about people, not about his iron.
She's worried about you, Ed.
I'll take it out for you.
Al?
I can't eat anyway.
They hate the military here.
Yes, I was ready for that.
After all, I also want to get the qualification of a state alchemist.
Don't.
Enough of what I get on nuts.
And I really became a real army dog.
Brother.
On the road.
It's still a dirty establishment, Holling.
I ask you, Lieutenant Yoki, to come to our lodge.
Let's do without greetings.
You haven't paid taxes for a long time.
And not only that.
I'm sorry, but we don't make much money.
That's because you don't work well.
What?
You cut our salaries, and also increased taxes.
Lieutenant Yoki was assigned to these mines from the headquarters.
Shut up.
We make money here with sweat and blood.
And he spends them on bribes.
He gets promotion.
I'm sorry.
Why don't you pay taxes too?
In the world, it's not so easy to just enjoy life.
That's amazing.
Well, that's it.
Today my patience is over.
Good girl, Lyland.
Apparently, the rumors that this establishment became a place for the assembly of rebels.
Right?
If so, I'll have to close it.
What?
Go to hell!
This boy ...
It will hurt a little, but it will be a lesson for you.
Stop!
Who are you?
I heard that you would come here, Mr. Lieutenant.
So I decided to say hello.
This is ...
Who is this guy, Mr. Lieutenant?
Fool, I didn't hear about state alchemists.
This organization is under the supervision of the Fuhrer.
What?
Excuse me, my uneducated subordinates.
My name is Yoki, I run this city.
What could have brought you to our province?
I just came to check.
Check?
Oh, if only you knew in advance, I would have come to meet you.
Probably you are tired.
Please, please come to my mansion.
Army dog.
Congratulations, Mustang.
Probably in the near future you will become a colonel.
Hawkeye will also receive an increase to the lieutenant.
I'm glad to try, General Hakuro.
Since you have significantly increased your rights,
how do you look to take command of the Eastern HQ?
So, humiliation.
After all, if someone like me works in the central ...
What are you talking about?
This is not humiliation, but an increase, Colonel Mustang.
The only thing they say is that there is a lot of all kinds of scum.
Be careful.
For me, it is a great honor that I can take Mr. State Alchemist in my house.
By the way, since such an outstanding alchemist visited us today ...
Lyla, show me your skill.
Yes.
No, I've already seen it.
Atmospheric air was transformed into liquid, the volume decreased.
Then there was a rapid evaporation, which caused a shock wave.
Illumination occurred due to high temperatures caused by adiabatic compression.
And you understood this at first glance?
I also want to receive the qualification of State Alchemist and become like Mr. Elric.
Like me?
Yes.
My dream is to become an alchemist at the service of the state.
Well, don't be shy, please, help yourself.
I really don't know if you will like our simple provincial food.
You eat well.
And the city is in such a desert.
I'm terribly embarrassed.
But lately they don't want to pay taxes, which is difficult.
Besides, among the residents there are so many all kinds of scams, you saw.
That is, they refuse to pay taxes and only inflate the rights.
Oh, you are so prudent, Mr. Elric.
Because the whole logic of our world is expressed mainly by the law of alchemy,
the law of equal exchange.
Rights are obtained together with duties, right?
Right, right, perfectly said.
In connection with this, I hope you will accept it as an expression of the logic of our world.
Lila, please accept this as a sign of my respect.
Is this so-called bribe?
Not at all.
I dare to say that this is an equal exchange.
I really hope for a positive test result.
I'll think about it.
I knew, Mr. Edward, that you are a very understanding person.
People in the city will calm down very soon, so please wait a little.
How is he alone there?
What is it?
Kyle! Kyle!
Let him go, he's still inside!
No, master, it's dangerous.
He may choke!
Shut up! Let him go!
Kyle! Kyle! Kyle! Kyle, where are you?
Kyle! Kyle!
Dad!
Dad!
Is this their business?
Yes.
You're a great alchemist.
Then create gold.
Save dad and this city.
Save us.
You can't.
Why? You're not losing anything.
The main law of alchemy is an equal exchange.
I have no obligations for long before this city.
You're a bribe-taker too?
How can you be called an alchemist?
Alchemy should serve people, right?
Creating gold is a serious crime.
If they find out, I'll lose the license of a state alchemist and go to prison.
Nobody will find out!
Even if I make gold, it will all go to tax payments.
It's so bad here.
Then look for a job in another place.
Leave the city.
Baby, you may not understand this,
but I'm sure you will.
Baby, you may not understand this,
but this is our house we want to live in until we die.
A house you want to live in until you die?
Ed!
Al!
We burned down our own house.
We have nowhere to go back to.
And it suits me.
But we have to help those who have a place to go back to.
Al, keep what you see a secret.
You want to buy a mine?
Yes.
I want to buy everything from you.
Do you agree?
But even if the state alchemist himself asks me, it is impossible.
What a pity.
And this money was specially prepared.
Is this all gold?
I found elements of interest for alchemy here.
I don't want them to go into someone else's hands.
Isn't that enough?
Why not?
However, if I sell the mines,
the control over which I am entrusted to the state,
then I will have such an income that I ...
Don't worry, there will be no records of this gold anywhere.
Therefore, if you do not tell anyone, then no one will recognize it.
However ...
Well, then just write to Maga
that they gave me all the rights to the mine free of charge.
And then all this will be yours, Lieutenant Yoki.
Why?
Why are you stopping me?
Because.
No raids.
But they destroyed our hotel.
It was just a hotel.
Do not boil yourself.
Hello, sour faces.
Come on, look more fun.
Why did you come here?
Oh, oh, oh.
Does he talk to the manager of this city?
Manager?
What are you carrying?
As you can see, this is confidence in the right to produce.
Sales, management and so on.
What?
In other words, at the moment, these mines belong to me.
But that's not the problem.
I have to go back to the headquarters.
And to carry this certificate with you is troublesome.
What to do, huh?
Are you really trying to sell it to us?
It's expensive.
If you want to get something, you need to pay the appropriate price.
And for this certificate, high-quality parchment is used.
In addition, with gold.
In addition, the folder is laid out in small pieces of jasper.
Luxurious design, you can not say anything.
A real work of art.
And the key is made of pure silver.
According to modest calculations, it costs 200,000.
200,000?
All rights to the coal mine?
200,000?
All of it?
All of it?
The room in your hotel costs 200,000.
Let's stay here for the night.
Equal exchange.
But our hotel ...
Whose hotel is this?
Our hotel!
What is it?
This is the payment for living.
Of course.
Well, then I'll change it.
Mr. Elric, what is it?
The gold bars obtained from you turned into stones.
Gold bars? What are you talking about?
Do not laugh at me.
Have we not exchanged a mountain of gold bars for a certificate?
Yes.
Didn't you give it to me free of charge?
Here, and the document is available.
Is this cheating?
And what is the word cheating?
How rude.
This is a legal deal.
Such a deal is not really, Lila.
Alchemy should serve people.
It cannot be used for its own benefit.
You are a state alchemist.
Why are you going against the army?
I was never going to sell my soul.
Oh, you!
Take back the paper!
Mr. Yoki!
You know, it's not good to take away someone else's property.
You are not worthy of becoming an actor, Mr. Lieutenant.
Drinks!
Bring me a drink!
Listen, isn't this hotel better than our old one?
Yes, he did incredible.
Edward Elric, steel alchemist.
This is a report from Edward Elric.
Thank you.
It seems that thanks to him, the check of the Yusval shaft and those responsible for them in the eastern headquarters will be carried out.
That's it.
Well, now it will be easier to live in the east.
I'm glad that if we are transferred, it will be possible not to strain.
It can't be!
Did you plan it?
I don't know.
The main thing is that the women in the east are beautiful.
Rumors have already spread throughout the east that there are those in the army who stand on the side of the people.
Edward Elric!
How did you hear about him?
Yes, and what kind of guy is he?
They say that although he is a state alchemist, he is always on the side of ordinary people.
Ah, he must be wonderful.
He just didn't grow up, you can't see him from the ground.
What do you mean, you can't see him from the ground?
Brother, enough!
Stop!
Come on, wait!
Well, brother, you didn't have enough strength to run to DeLior!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
