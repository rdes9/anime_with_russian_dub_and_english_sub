If it is possible to create a miracle with the help of a philosophical stone, then why is all this happening?
Please, put down your weapons! Please, put down your weapons!
Please, put down your weapons! Please, put down your weapons!
Please, put down your weapons! Please, put down your weapons!
Rosa, don't we have to fight?
With whom?
What a fool! What are you going to do with these little people?
Fools! Fools!
When everything goes so smoothly, then this stupidity even excites me.
That's right, Mr. Pastor.
Pastor!
I just put a little bit of the parishioners.
Believers began to kill each other, and the military only poured oil into the fire, trying to suppress the conflict.
Every time the same thing is repeated, and no one makes conclusions from the lessons.
People are pathetic and stupid creatures.
All this is to create a philosophical stone.
And now, finally, I ...
I can return to my wonderful appearance.
Again, you like to make yourself young.
What are you doing here? I already forgot what my real appearance was like.
What does it mean?
Pastor, where is the real Cornelius?
What are we going to do?
What if we tell him the truth? The pastor has long been ...
Can I eat him?
When a person wants to get something, he needs to sacrifice something.
Thus, if you want to get something, you must replace it with something equal.
In alchemy, this is called the law of equal exchange.
At that time, we believed that this was the truth that ruled the world.

By the way, according to my information, this guy left the Central and is now back to East City.
Do you mean that victim who is the murderer of Elizabeth?
We can't let the killer do his job.
I'm so full of passion!
Wipe your mouth if you're hungry.
Okay.
And what's the name of this guy?
A scar?
A man with a scar?
We don't know anything about him yet.
There's a witness who says he has a big scar on his forehead.
That's what we called him.
Did he kill a man with a scar?
That's what we called him.
Did he kill a few state alchemists?
Nine people.
There are four in the Central, and nine state alchemists have fallen from his hands.
If you count those killed who were connected to the alchemists,
there will be more than one dozen.
The damage is such as if the victims were blown up from the inside,
but neither his weapons nor his goals are completely unknown.
That's why everyone in the central headquarters is in complete panic.
Under the pretext of escorting the chancellor, all the members have arrived here.
They think the killer in this puddle will not follow them.
There's you here.
And those who complained to you three years ago know about your abilities.
Now I want to run away too.
We don't know the next goal of this type.
Excuse me.
Oh, you know, I have a lovely daughter who will turn three soon.
I'm calling you.
Oh, there she is.
Hello, this is Hugh.
Major?
Roger.
At the IS-City station, the patrol found a body of a watchman.
And he was blown up from the inside?
Yeah.
Where lives Dr. Marko?
Maybe Mr. Mauro?
No, Marko.
But there's only one doctor in this village.
Mr. Mauro.
As you can see, people here are poor.
Before getting to the doctor, you had to get to the IS-City for half a day.
Good man.
He always accepts patients on whom the others waved their hand.
I have a leg in the cultivator.
It almost died, but it healed.
Now it's like new.
During the treatment, something went rrrrrr and flashed.
Exactly.
Light.
After all, this is alchemy.
Dr. Marko.
But he ran away from the army, right?
Why did he become a doctor?
Rumors will spread about him.
I'm stuffed with straw.
Who is this?
This is one of the state alchemists.
He came from the central with the Fuhrer.
Why is he here?
Is he watching us?
The colonel said he didn't tell about Marko's location in the central.
Hurry up.
Marko's house is somewhere close.
Hey, wait.
We're just...
You say, state alchemist?
You came to take me?
You're a crystal alchemist, Dr. Marko.
I don't want to return to the army.
I don't want to return to the army.
Please, no.
We came to talk.
Ed, be careful with him.
Or do you want to shut me up?
Do you want to kill me?
I... I...
It's all right.
Even if you shoot, I won't die.
Oh!
So you...
So you are a state alchemist?
No, it's me.
It's me, got it?
The end
When I was on a desert, I took all the documents with me.
With the results of the research that I conducted.
The military may still be hunting with these papers.
To be honest,
we are also studying human transmutation.
I can't help you with anything.
Even though I acted according to the order,
I got my hands dirty with these researches.
They were used for a nightmare cut during the Civil War in Ushvar.
Nightmare cut?
Are you talking about the Ushvar uprising?
Horrible.
It was a terrible war.
Women, children,
everyone was killed.
Without any special reasons.
The people of Ushvar simply resisted.
That turned out to be enough.
What I did, I can't buy with all my life.
No!
But I want to do at least what is in my power.
So I work here as a doctor.
Go away.
I am a state alchemist.
I have the right to get acquainted with your researches.
Despite the fact that you are so young.
Apparently, you got a license
with a good financing
and all the rights that it gives.
How stupid if you were in that war.
I understand.
You said it was stupid.
And yet...
Mr. Marco,
five years ago you treated children in the town of Xenotime.
These children are completely healthy now.
Brother!
From the alchemical circle?
Red water from Xenotime?
No, much more transparent.
Stop!
Ed!
Ed, it's not good.
Let me go!
Ed!
Let me go!
It's not liquid.
Brother, it looks like
what Cornelius had in Leor.
A philosophical stone,
a heavenly stone,
a great elixir,
a red mixture,
this substance is called differently,
and it doesn't necessarily have to be a stone.
Brigadier General Gran.
General?
You, as I see it, have made a career.
Crystal alchemist,
give us the philosophical stone and all the documents.
A philosophical stone?
This one?
It was obtained as a result of experiments.
We don't know when the end will come,
after which its application is impossible.
It is unstable, imperfect,
and differs from the real one.
However, then, during the uprising,
it significantly increased our capabilities.
Let me go!
So you're saying that the military
had long been studying the philosophical stone?
Let it not be perfect,
but the fact that it is made of human
means that the creation of the philosophical stone is possible.
But what about it?
What are you going to do with it,
steel alchemist?
The research is strictly classified
and is under my control.
I can't give you access to the materials.
Let's go!
Let me go!
I don't want to! No!
No!
Let me go!
I don't want to go back there!
I don't want to go back there!
I don't want to! I'm sorry!
I don't want to!
I don't want to!
Just as before.
I haven't grown up at all.
I can't do it.
I can't do it.
It's him.
Steel Alchemist.
Basgran?
I feel sorry for you,
because I have this right now.
Stop!
Stop!
It's him.
It seems to be Central three years ago.
But the most terrible thing is...
I got caught.
I have to run.
And my legs don't work.
Steel Alchemist, Dr. Marco.
I heard you died.
I have to kill you
especially hard.
You...
That's how it is.
You won't do anything.
In the name of God,
die!
Edward!
Run!
Steel Alchemist,
I won't let you go either.
How does he know about me?
What's going on?
Of course, I did a lot of stupid things
and you can be angry at me.
But I don't remember doing anything
that deserves death.
Edward, come here!
What's going on?
No!
Who are you?
Why are you hunting us?
If you are a creator,
then you are a destroyer.
Edward, leave me and run!
You have good eyes.
My older brother had the same eyes.
But he had a close look.
As if he was looking somewhere far away.
Yes, when it was
three years ago.
Then I heard
that you left the state alchemists
and I was glad to hear that.
It's a pity to hear it, but...
You are late!
Brother!
Al!
Don't be mistaken.
I intended to destroy human flesh,
so I only went through cracks.
Don't mess with me.
I only fight
with state alchemists.
Why?
Why us?
Alchemists change the form
of things that originally
belong to others.
And this is the desecration
of the creator of everything
that belongs to our God.
I am the messenger of God
and the executor
of His punishment.
I am also an alchemist.
I don't have a license
for the state.
Why are you looking for death?
You just said
about your older brother,
so you should understand.
I can't see
how my brother will be killed.
I know
what you feel
when you can only watch
how your brother is killed.
That's why
I am now...
I told you
you wouldn't make it.
Ah!
Hmm.
Auto armor.
So your right hand
can only be destroyed?
Don't compare.
My right hand...
State alchemist?
Are you catching Marco?
I'm sorry I'm late.
The lieutenant colonel
sent me to you for security.
What? Lieutenant colonel Hughes?
So you are the messenger of God.
So don't go to his humble servant
Kara.
I'm sorry.
The alchemist of the strong hand
Alex Alui Armstrong
is here.
What a
lucky day!
I've got rid of
the need to search
for all of you.
God must help me.
Well, look.
This is the technique
of the true art of alchemy
which was passed down
from generation to generation
to generation.
And here it is!
You see, there are only
children here.
There are no guerillas you are searching for.
So you have turned away
from studying the Cornell.
Okay.
Then give me a place
I don't know!
We came to free this city from Cornell.
Don't you understand?
This city is our homeland.
With our own forces, we can slowly move forward.
We have healthy legs for this!
You dropped it.
Here.
Didn't you think that you could run away from it?
You use it when you're healing.
I can't forget the faces of people who told me about you.
I can't forget the faces of people who told me about you.
You don't belong to yourself.
You belong to these people.
Can you go?
Then let's go.
Where no military or murderers will come after us.
Can we run away from them?
You have healthy legs, don't you?
I can't forget the faces of people who told me about you.
Can you go?
Then let's go.
Where no military or murderers will come after us.
Can we run away from them?
You have healthy legs, don't you?
You have healthy legs, don't you?
You have healthy legs, don't you?
Can we run away from them?
