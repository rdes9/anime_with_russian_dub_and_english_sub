Mr. Elric, what happened?
Nothing.
I told you not to interfere.
They don't trust you.
Maybe it'll be easier if you call yourself by your real name.
Fletcher!
Run! Hurry!
Ed!
If they catch you, we'll be in trouble too.
Our trap will open!
Al, run!
Forgive me.
I wanted to...
...do my best.
When a person wants to get something, he needs to sacrifice something.
So, if you want to get something, you have to give something equal in return.
In alchemy, this is called the law of equal exchange.
At that time, we believed that this is the truth that rules the world.
The End
Looking at the sky where tomorrow will come
My heart is full of confusion
A bird flew away
Did it find the light somewhere?
Will you put me on your back?
And at the highest point
I'll leave you and get away from kindness
The End
You promised you wouldn't use alchemy.
Your father didn't like it.
This is terrible.
Mr. Maguire.
Oh, everything is fine with you and Bami.
And nothing happened to the stone.
Don't worry, it's here.
Oh, you've grown it to such a size.
But there is no more time. Please.
Even without the second method, the stone ...
You don't intend to follow the order?
No.
Once upon a time, one man told me the same thing.
A loser who, as a result, ran away.
With the help of this, even I, who do not know alchemy,
With the help of this, even I, who do not know alchemy,
Mr. Maguire.
Great.
They say about the real brothers of the Elrics,
bright hair and golden eyes.
And you are our son, Tringon.
I think,
Something was noisy in the teak.
Really?
Went there again.
What can you do with you?
Is Lisa still here?
Uh-huh.
The grape vine almost went bad,
but she takes care of it.
Cries, cries.
And he says she will stay here
although the cough is very strong.
It's been a long time since I laid it down.
Red water.
They tried to condense it and get a philosophical stone.
But this stone is not real. It's just a fake.
And what did he mean by talking about the dream of his father?
Yes, he just justified himself.
And maybe these are the sons of Nash?
Nash?
Nash Tringham, who opened the Red Water?
He was born in this city.
In order to study the Red Water, he went to Central.
But one day he came back here.
Nash? Nash, is that you?
You're back? How's life?
Hmph.
This city is in complete decline.
I think that it will be enough to live, relying only on the extraction of gold.
How are your research of the Red Water? Are they going according to the plan?
I abandoned them. I will not do this anymore.
And I will not return to Central anymore.
What? And what about your family?
My family?
I abandoned them.
My wife and my children.
Nash?
He abandoned everything. And he didn't say a word.
He didn't say a word about what happened in Central.
A large landowner from our city, McVar, approached him.
He offered Nash to study the Red Water.
No matter how much you ask, I have only one answer.
And you don't care about the city?
Only your Red Water can now create gold.
If we have gold, the city will revive again.
Dear Nash, only you can save all of us.
Please.
And in the end, Nash Tringham agreed to the offer of McVar.
And he secluded himself in his golden search, starting his research.
The city was divided for the second time, thanks to gold.
In the stove, the fire was blown up, gold products poured out on the street, people revived.
However, at the same time, the disease began to spread, the cause of which was unknown.
The newborns were dying because no one knew how to treat them.
Eliza, too, at that time...
After some time, Dr. Alchemist Mark came to this city.
The cause of the disease is poison absorbed into the ground.
Red Water.
The color!
Yes.
This color...
It can't be!
In any case, it was thanks to his treatment that Eliza was saved.
Then I asked Nash...
Tell me, Nash, will this city soon become a city of death?
Did you do it?
I was wrong.
Again.
Again.
I'll put an end to this.
I have to.
Nash...
Since then, no one has seen him.
After that, they stopped mining gold, and the city came to a standstill again.
If they are Nash's sons, then they probably followed their father.
Ed...
So what?
You can't do anything here.
They had no one but their father.
Yes, they just justify themselves by covering up the family of their father.
Maybe that's right?
And aren't we the wrong ones?
Yes, we are.
I...
I understand their feelings.
There you go.
You could have kept quiet and used the second method.
You know, what kind of method is that?
It's a secret.
It's a secret.
It's a secret.
The second method!
You know, what kind of method is that?
It's simple.
Let the woman who got pregnant drink the red water.
The water that passes through the placenta turns into a crystal.
It can't be!
Shut up!
And when the time comes, we'll take the crystal and transform it.
Simple and right method.
You're as gentle as your father.
Wait!
Tell me something.
Did your father use this method?
He backed off when there was only one step left.
If he had used it, he would have saved his life.
You said he died of illness.
Wait!
Hey, wait!
I figured it out.
Now I just have to use the method of my brothers-in-arms.
I'll make it happen.
It will work.
You won't be able to make a rope out of them.
It's hard to use the method they use.
Please, wait a little longer.
Just a little bit.
Okay.
I'll try.
I'm listening.
I'm listening.
A convenient case will be presented soon.
I'm not so comfortable with those self-proclaimed people.
Yes, I swallowed them alive.
But I dare, despite what happened,
ask you, alchemists of the highest skill,
to help me in one thing.
Research of red water?
Are you already aware of it?
Then it will be easier for me to explain.
I accidentally heard that you are very insistently interested in the Philosopher's Stone.
Well, what do you say?
This sample was obtained by crystallization of red water.
Well, what's next?
I want to save Xenotime.
If we can revive the Golden Search, people will not leave the city.
Okay, that's clear.
And where are the self-proclaimed people?
They are in the dungeon.
What are you doing?
I'm not interested in the incomplete sample.
First, the punishment of the self-proclaimed people.
I never forgive the cheaters.
So you accept the offer?
Yes, for us it's a couple of blanks.
But first I'll deal with the self-proclaimed people.
My hands are itchy.
Are you with me?
No, no.
I will allow myself to refuse.
Listen.
Hello.
Alphonse?
I found out here that Nash Tringham is your father.
What did you achieve by continuing his research?
This is the water of my father.
It was my duty to continue his work.
Well, you're a fool.
You understand what the inhabitants of this city faced because of the poisonous water.
Your father understood.
Therefore, he wanted to stop the research.
It is impossible to gain happiness if you rely on red water or a philosophical stone.
Move forward.
And don't do stupid things.
Since they were called by our names.
Al, let's go.
Okay.
If everything works out, then these guys...
These guys?
Who are you talking about?
I don't like one thing.
The red water researcher, Nash Tringham.
He did this.
Nash?
Oh.
He didn't do anything and I fired him.
Huh.
You don't look like a person who will let those who know everything go.
What do you want to say?
I'm not going to help the killer, Magwar.
Never.
So.
You can't get out of here alive.
You never know in the world of alchemists.
Stone?
That means he wasn't alone.
He's not as perfect as he is.
Die.
What?
What is it?
I have more.
It can't be.
It won't help.
That's it.
I think it's not even worth it.
There's more.
Now, Al.
Al.
Ed.
You needed our help, didn't you?
What?
I won't follow my father anymore.
We'll find our own way.
Brother.
Ed.
A secret passage.
That bastard escaped.
Are we almost there?
We're almost there.
There's a spring from which the red water runs.
Magwar blocked the way.
I'll get him out of there.
What?
I won't give you a spring for nothing.
While I have at least some water, we can continue the investigation.
I'm not afraid of any state alchemists.
Ed.
Brother.
Not bad, Magwar.
But you underestimate state alchemists.
Get out of here.
Well, did you get it?
We have different weight categories.
Different.
What's going on?
Ed.
Enough.
Run.
I won't give you a spring for nothing.
Let's go.
That's water.
The red water is pouring out.
Let's start with this one.
What about the other places?
Considering the recent hit, the danger is at the base of the rock.
I hope this will stop the flow.
The trees are absorbing the red water.
Ed.
I saw the same plant in the lab.
It makes the trees absorb the red water and neutralize the poison.
Brother.
Ed.
They did it.
Thank you.
And sorry.
The History of Man
Guys.
This is charger.
Thank you.
Be safe.
Come to us again.
We'll be sure to come.
You can really live in this town.
Willie, can you?
Ready to take any punishment.
I can be useful if I work with Bercio.
Ed, are you still looking for the Philosopher's Stone?
Yes.
Let me tell you about the method of crystallization of red water.
This is not an apology.
You better know this.
There is no need for this.
We will find everything ourselves.
For sure.
Edward, come again.
We will make this city better.
And by that time, you will grow up a little more.
Are you kidding me again?
Goodbye.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
A letter.
A letter?
Well, what is there?
What is there?
Nothing special, it doesn't matter.
Show me.
Show me.
Show me.
Show me.
Ed.
Ed.
Show me.
Edward, we are grateful to you for everything.
Thank you.
I'm sorry that I spoke so impudently,
although I'm younger than you for a whole year.
I will try to become the best older brother for Fletcher.
Now you will always be an example for me.
Have a good trip.
Bye.
What are you doing?
You are so much older than me, and by age you are a year younger.
It's not funny.
Everything will be fine with them.
Yes.
They are full of determination, and they have honest faces.
I'm so small.
I keep making mistakes.
No matter how much I try to be strong,
I can't do anything without hurting anyone.
Without hesitation, I believe in fear.
I hold on tight to the sound of the rustling wind.
The two of us keep walking,
because we can't go back.
Even now, in the depths of my heart,
there is no sea that can't be erased.
Darling.
Episode 12.
Fire against steel.
Colonel Roy Mustang is a state alchemist.
His name is Fiery.
He must be stronger than his brother.
That's not true!
