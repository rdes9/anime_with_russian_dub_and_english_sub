And what's next?
You'll answer for betraying my comrades and greed!
Kimblee, why are you here?
What's so strange about me, a state alchemist?
He sold us and returned to the army!
So what? Will you let me finish like this?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
So what? Will you let me finish like this?
Martell, stop!
What are you doing?
Stop!
Let me go! I told you to let me go!
Are you okay?
Let me go!
The glorious fireworks will come out of you!
That's it, that's it, let me go! Let me go!
Kimblee, what are you doing to him?
First of all, I'm a military man, and I don't want to be hated by the younger generation.
Martell!
When a person wants to get something, he needs to sacrifice something.
In this way, if you want to get something, you have to give something equal in return.
In alchemy, this is called the law of equal exchange.
At that time, we believed that this was the truth that ruled the world.
Martell!
Martell!
Martell!
Martell!
Martell!
Martell!
Martell!
Martell!
Martell!
Martell!
Martell!
Martell!
Martell!
Martell!
Martell!
What are you talking about? Are you talking about this snake or something?
Martell is a human.
I didn't know, I didn't know.
She's a chimera.
You can't even call her a living creature.
Just like you.
Get away from Martell.
Get away!
You won't have time for alchemy!
Al!
Al!
That's it.
Thank you for preparing the raw materials for me.
Martell!
You're a monster!
Colonel!
Al and his elder brother are under my command.
If you have any problems, you can report to me.
Be sure to blow up these damn armor.
Mr. Fuhrer, are you going to the front line?
I can't let Leon become another Ishwar.
We have to finish this as quickly as possible, with minimal losses.
Yes, sir, but...
I want to entrust you with the duties of Fuhrer's deputy.
It's an honor for me.
I trust you.
Yes, sir!
Deputy Fuhrer!
Deputy Fuhrer!
Deputy Fuhrer!
Yes, I'm sorry.
I'll send something to my wife.
She'll be sad while I'm away.
I'm counting on you.
Yes, sir!
Another city will fall for those who are looking for philosophical values.
Once you get here, you should know my goal.
Yes, I know.
You've come up with a stupid idea to create the Philosopher's Stone.
You won't get in my way.
The Philosopher's Stone...
I really need to know one thing from you.
Four years ago, in Central, the dog of Chimera...
I returned it to the Kingdom of God.
Why did you do it?
It's none of your business, Shram!
Is that all you wanted to ask?
Are you going to destroy Rose and the rest of the people because of your stupid ideas?
How do you know her?
I'll tell you now!
Why?
You don't understand.
You're an alchemist too.
You think I'm an alchemist?
Alchemists use three steps.
Analysis, decomposition and restructuring.
You unconsciously read the metal structure of the stone.
You're an alchemist.
You're an alchemist.
You're an alchemist.
You're an alchemist.
You're an alchemist.
You're an alchemist.
You unconsciously read the metal structure of your enemy and direct your force to destruction.
That's why I was transmuting steel in my car armor.
It doesn't look like metal at all.
So that's how it is.
Because I'm using another metal now, the tuning of my prosthesis is being violated.
So, come on!
Die, quickly!
You're a fool!
Citizens use their lives to create the philosophy of the stone.
Next time, it will be you who will be avenged by the scars!
Did you forget?
I can also destroy human flesh!
Kamonkula?
My name is Passion.
I'm an alchemist.
Do you understand?
Passion?
Do you understand what we represent?
A steel baby.
Yeah, that's how you say goodbye.
Don't worry.
It was hot.
It's not easy to kill us.
We're so greedy.
We're protecting you from the scars.
I'm your enemy.
Isn't that right?
If you say you can create the philosophy of the stone, then we will protect you.
And we won't let the baby get in your way.
You won't remember this thing.
You gave it to my brother.
What are you talking about?
Come on, remember!
Passion!
Passion!
I hate you! I hate you all!
What's wrong with these Kamonkula?
It's none of your business.
Wait!
Rosa and Laila?
Please, Edward, listen to him.
This is what Rosa wants to tell you.
Rosa?
Are you an anime?
Let it be your amulet.
If I don't get it, you won't forget me.
Do you understand?
When the world was ruling in Ishvara,
I had an elder brother.
He was smart.
Everyone respected him.
I was proud of him.
My brother had a beautiful lover.
She fell ill,
and very early on,
Ishvara's god took her to him.
Brother, what are you looking for?
Great teaching.
With its help, you can give new life.
Brother, isn't this alchemy
used by people from the Central?
It seems that one of the techniques
of great teaching allows us to resurrect people.
Is that clear?
Brother!
In order to resurrect her,
the brother turned away from Ishvara's teachings.
He lost part of his body,
but it still didn't return.
The brothers were expelled
because the great teaching
was under the strictest prohibition.
But perhaps the brother
succeeded.
This woman is passionate.
Do you know how and why
homunculi are born?
When someone suffers an accident
due to human transmutation,
such a creature appears,
homunculi.
And Danta told me
that she didn't succeed in transmutation,
and she created homunculi.
She must have been greedy.
But they can't live long.
Someone gathers these homunculi,
passion, envy,
and prolongs their lives
to command them.
So my brother created passion.
She has no soul.
She is a monster,
despite the fact that she looks like a human.
I didn't like this amulet.
The weak point of the homunculi
is a part of the body of that person
due to the transmutation
of which the homunculi was born.
Right after the brother left,
we were attacked.
We rose up and reflected
this sudden attack.
And then it started.
It was a long, long war.
I found a way to create
the Philosopher's Stone.
Brother!
With its power,
I can save Ishvar from danger.
It was wartime,
so no one resisted
the brother's return.
However, the brother,
coming close to creating
the Philosopher's Stone,
suddenly dropped his research.
Now I understand the reason.
In Kisha,
I heard something
from one of the Sgoivs.
According to the great teaching,
a lot of lives are required
to create the Philosopher's Stone.
That's right.
It will take so many lives
that the whole city
and the whole people will die.
Despair, hatred,
anger at the moment of death.
If they don't merge together,
the Philosopher's Stone
will not work.
To save Ishvar,
the Philosopher's Stone was necessary.
However,
to create the Stone,
Ishvar had to be destroyed.
I am a state alchemist
who kills you in this area.
A state alchemist?
Stop!
We are running from our country.
Isn't that enough?
I was simply ordered
to destroy you,
destroy everyone,
those who have a different skin color
or, let's say, eyes.
Why?
I don't know.
I have a great idea.
Let me blow up
such an idiot in parts.
First, I will turn your skin
into an explosive.
Now this hand.
And then...
Oh, this body
resembles an alchemical circle.
So there were alchemists
in Ishvar too.
But I have a transmutation
amplifier.
Colonel Negra!
Brother!
Brother!
I give you the lives
of our people
who were in me.
No.
Brother, why?
This hand has power.
Don't do it.
You would die.
Brother!
Brother!
What I did
cannot be forgiven.
You loved her
so much.
I'm sorry.
I will see her
for the first time.
Your brother tried to create
a philosophical stone
in his own body.
He collected the lives
of the dead Ishvars
and gave them to you in this hand.
The philosophical stone
has power in itself.
It is thanks to this
that I remained alive.
But this hand is not a completed
philosophical stone.
Hence the reaction to the red stone.
To complete it,
you still need life.
And yet,
there is nothing to give to him
to sacrifice the people of Elior.
Wait.
Mr. Shram is not going to sacrifice
the people of Elior.
Laila, why are you here?
After Dante died,
I was looking for a place
where alchemy could be useful.
And I found out
about Mr. Shram's plan.
Right before the beginning
of the battle,
people will run through the tunnel
that was once a temple.
They will lead to the city.
There will be victims anyway.
Once they are military,
they can be killed.
Do you know what they did
in this city?
What did they do to Rose?
They took her with them.
And when she returned,
she no longer had a voice.
And you still want
me to forgive them?
Martell, where are you?
What a disaster!
I wanted to go after my brother.
Hewok!
What happened?
Are you really leaving?
I don't know.
They say the Fuhrer is here.
I'm so glad
that the Fuhrer himself
is here.
I want to secretly
ask you two for help.
Colonel Kimble,
I want you to take Mr. Tucker's
alchemy and enter the Lior.
I see.
So we just have to make noise
so that they attack us in anger,
just like in Ishwar.
However, it is not worth
creating too many problems.
No matter how it is,
the world is first for us.
Our moral duty is to answer first.
In addition,
there is one state alchemist
in the Lior now.
Edward Elric.
I think he's dead.
Find his body.
Our moral duty
is becoming more and more clear to me.
If I don't find his dead body,
I'll help him become like that.
It's a pity to lose the best.
I won't let you do that.
I won't let you repeat Ishwar.
I won't let you kill Ed.
Come on, cancel your order.
Otherwise...
Your speed is useless
against me.
I have absolutely no strength
to do it.
Ed! Al!
Al! Martell!
Listen!
Give it to Ed!
Give it to him!
Take it away!
Al, listen!
Are you okay?
Hey!
Huh?
Are you all right, Alphonse?
I destroyed the chemist who seemed to have threatened you.
Alphonse!
Alphonse!
Alphonse!

The Last of Us
Episode 41
Save
I can hear...
That voice...
It's that nostalgic voice that I should have lost long ago...
