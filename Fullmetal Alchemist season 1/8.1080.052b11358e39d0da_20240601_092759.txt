If the devil exists, then this is clearly his business.
The devil? We are state alchemists, military officers, living weapons.
If something happens, we will stand up for the gun.
If they give an order, we will not be afraid to get our hands dirty.
We condemn the fact that Taker got away with the life of a man,
but we will not forgive him.
We will not forgive him.
We condemn the fact that Taker got away with the life of a man,
but his actions are not very different from what we do.
This is the logic of adults, and they are still just children.
Ed, brother, there is a lieutenant colonel here.
Useless efforts.
It is impossible to reconstruct a living creature and a single life lost.
No matter how you are an alchemist,
who will be happy if you revive this miserable chimera?
On the path you chose, guys,
you will probably still have a lot of suffering.
Therefore, it remains only to accept it and move on.
Accept it?
Don't you have a goal that you strive for?
Do you have time to stop?
What kind of life is this?
Even calmly not to buy a daughter.
Here?
Yes, sir.
The investigation department will continue to work here.
You may be free.
It's a terrible case.
Could it be the traces of a serial killer again?
He specializes in young women.
Besides, all his victims were lured.
And it seems as if it exploded from the inside.
When a person wants to get something,
he needs to sacrifice something.
Thus, if you want to get something,
you must replace something equal.
In alchemy, this is called the law of equal exchange.
At that time, we believed that this was the truth that ruled the world.
And they were so close!
To be continued
Will you put me on your back?
And then, at the highest place
I'll leave you and go away from kindness
With your hands, I'll cut you apart
The memories of the distant days
The roots of sadness
Please, stop breathing
Now, pierce through the heart yearning for love
Ah!
Well, Ilyitsa?
So much has happened
I decided that I will not hesitate anymore and...
And what is our order?
So here
It is necessary to systematize and arrange these materials
To finally figure out the results of Taker's research
That is, I must continue his research?
He was wrong in the methods
However, his research is of interest to our department
Let Taker make her do it
He is already dead
His crime is obvious
Therefore, according to the decision of the command, the sentence was introduced
What? Just crumpled the case?
How so?
It is necessary to be loyal to the army
The first rule of state alchemists
Listen, it seems that Mr. Taker was engaged in the research of the Philosopher's Stone
Yes, well
How much can be crumpled, Ed?
Isn't the Philosopher's Stone the most important secret of alchemy?
It allows to infinitely increase the skill
Gives the possibility of transmutation without relying on laws
Simply put, what we don't have
Yes, it's just a myth
Ordinary fairy tale
But since the state alchemist Taker was engaged in his research, it means...
I don't care about his research
I don't allow
Why?
It is quite likely that it was the serial killer who had an affair with Nina
I will help you find him
What about the work entrusted to you?
What about our research on Taker?
I don't want to do this
I don't want to do this
I don't want to do this
I don't want to do this
I don't want to do this
I don't want to do this
I don't want to do this
I will be looking for the serial killer myself
Well, then put it here
Of course
Ed, wait
You're not worried alone
that you couldn't do anything for Nina
None of us are alchemists
The thing we could do
is not understand the criminal, but the research
that once existed
They will never be able to save a child like Nina.
Is that you?
It's you. You were in the library.
If you have access to the first section of the library, then you are also a state alchemist.
I was back then, but not anymore.
Is that so? That's for the best.
That's for the best.
If you don't want to be destroyed by this hand...
That's a lot of people. I came here to congratulate them.
Let's go.
Excuse me, young lieutenant.
It's all right. But I don't know much about the Philosopher's Stone.
At least I didn't hear that it really exists.
I thought it was just a myth.
I see.
But I don't think you should be interested in this anymore.
They say that those who get closer to the Philosopher's Stone are unfortunate.
A young man is interested in the Philosopher's Stone.
Who is that?
Yes, it's me.
Do you want to get the Philosopher's Stone?
Yes.
What do you need it for?
What do I need it for?
I mean, I want to get back what my brother lost.
Oh, what a caring little brother.
I'm not too well-informed about the Philosopher's Stone, but a lot of people believe in it.
Sometimes you have to hear that someone managed to create the Philosopher's Stone.
I see.
Of course, the army collects even such rumors.
In the first section of the central library there should be some records about all this.
Really?
But only state alchemists can use them.
I mean, a state alchemist can check these rumors.
Fuhrer, I'm sorry, but why did you tell him that?
It's good for young people to chase their dreams.
Don't you agree with me, young lieutenant?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Well?
Oh, pretty, right?
Well, yeah.
Well, what do you say?
Do I look like me?
Everyone says so, by the way.
Or am I?
Listen, don't bother me.
What are you talking about?
I showed you those secret documents on serial murders.
You owe me twice.
For the train and for my wife's inheritance.
Really?
In any case, we just have to put our hands down.
Crimes were committed in the city, and there are no witnesses.
The corpses are neatly scattered, it is unlikely that this can be done quickly.
Maybe they were killed in another place, and then transported?
How many hours usually pass after the death of a woman?
It happens that the autopsy does not give accurate results.
The military police inspect all cars entering the city.
Including trucks.
There must be something we missed here.
For example, a car in which the body is hidden.
Or part of an alchemist.
Alchemists are not murderers.
Are you Edward Alrick?
Yes.
A visitor to the reception headquarters.
A visitor?
Hello.
Oh, I brought it myself, sorry I didn't help.
Come on.
Was it a state qualification exam again?
Yes, I heard.
This time the exam was given by a 12-year-old boy.
It seems that he did it with his hands and turned something there.
Like this, can you imagine?
Wow.
Look, that's the light one.
Another child.
Be careful, the killer appeared again.
They say they cut into pieces beautiful women.
That's how it turns out, you don't worry about me?
Yes.
It would be good if he was caught faster.
Exactly.
Well, is there anything else about this case?
How long do I have to wait for this Ed?
Aha!
This is a refrigerator installation on wheels.
After all, the most modern cars are in the headquarters.
How great!
I really want to disassemble it by screws.
It's better not to disassemble, otherwise we won't take the trouble.
Excuse me, is this your car?
Mine.
More precisely, our food store.
Something wrong?
Do you want to look inside?
What? Can I?
Thank you very much!
That's it.
I told you to wait here.
Strange.
Mr. Elric.
This is...
Winry.
Was there a car here?
There is always a refrigerator machine for the canteen.
Refrigerator?
What about the dead bodies?
It can't be!
Mr. Elric.
Are you all right?
Did you get kidnapped too?
There is another one.
I see.
Let's take it and get out of here as soon as possible.
I'll be with you, so don't worry.
Good morning, baby.
Oh, you!
I heard that you can do transmutation without an alchemical ring.
So just in case.
Let me introduce myself.
I'm Barry, the owner of this store.
A man?
I'll show you something interesting as a reward for your hard work.
Winry!
Now I'm going to cut this baby into all the canons of art.
Watch me, you state alchemist.
Don't you dare!
Why are you doing this?
Why?
Just because I want to see it.
Why?
I just want to see it.
You want to see it?
I don't want to see it.
Don't you want to see it?
Okay, then.
I'll show you something interesting as a reward for coming here.
Do you like it?
The first person I killed was my wife.
It was a simple fight.
And I accidentally slapped her.
But I made her so beautiful.
And then I wanted to cut everything more beautiful and more beautiful.
I wanted everyone to see it.
And just because of that, one person can kill another?
Maybe.
A person can kill for the most stupid reason.
No, come closer!
And in a war, one person can kill another even easier.
What do you think, why?
Why?
Because people want to kill.
I saw how on the battlefield, just like you, state alchemists,
easily killed people.
Like this.
No.
No.
Akta!
Damn it!
Akta!
No!
I won't die from this.
He's here.
Don't move.
Alla.
Ed, are you hurt?
I thought I was going to die.
And I really thought I was going to die.
It was scary.
It was so scary.
So scary.
Thanks to the fact that Fuse noticed how through the post
one and the same truck of the grocery store passed several times,
we were able to arrive on time.
Subsequently, this crime became known as the case of the butcher's bar.
His discovery was the first success of my brother.
Ed, the Philosopher's Stone may actually exist,
but in order to find it, you must have a license from the state alchemist.
I don't have a body, so I can't feel the fear
that you felt when you thought you would be killed.
That's why it became so sad and so bitter.
I really want to get my human body back.
I need to find the Philosopher's Stone.
Even if I have to go against the whole world.
Even if it's impossible.
After I was almost killed, I understood something.
And then I could only scream.
My head was empty.
I thought too much about myself.
I doubted that I could save someone.
The fact that we can make all the effort to just get our business back.
And for this, let me be called an army dog or a devil, I don't care.
But in fact, we are not devils and, of course, we are not gods.
We are just people.
We couldn't even save Nina.
We are just pitiful people.
And what are the conditions?
I will fulfill military duties, but I want to get all the information related to the Philosopher's Stone.
And allow me all the time when I have no instructions to do his searches.
And what if your crime of transmutation of a person becomes known to others?
And the younger brother can be sent to the lab as a rare example of transmutation.
Huh? I can scare you too.
Okay, let it be so.
But you will tell me all the information you will find about the Philosopher's Stone.
The Fuhrer himself has given you a name.
A rather ironic name.
On behalf of the Fuhrer, King Bradley, you are Edward.
You, Edward Elric, are given the name Steel.
Steel?
State alchemists receive silver watches and a second name.
You will wear the name Steel.
Steel Alchemist.
Okay, I agree.
A bitter name, but it suits me.
What are you celebrating?
Treat me to something delicious, huh?
Isn't it the other way around?
I repaired your hand.
Ed, does the killer have anything to do with Nina?
No, he seems to have an alibi for tonight.
Who killed Nina in this case?
THE END
THE END
THE END
