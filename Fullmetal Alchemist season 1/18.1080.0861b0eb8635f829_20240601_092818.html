        <pre>Episode 1
It's not an easy task to find a book here.
It can't be.
Who's there?
What do you think about a man with a scar?
It looks like it, but it doesn't happen.
I can smell it.
I can smell the smell of a lot of blood.
Listen, do you still want to deal with this steel baby?
I don't like it.
What if the boy doesn't go hunting for the Philosopher's Stone?
I don't understand what you're talking about.
I guess I said something wrong.
Can I eat one more thing?
When a man wants to get something, he needs to sacrifice something.
So, if you want to get something, you have to give something equal in return.
In chemistry, this is called the law of equal exchange.
At that time, we believed that it was the truth that ruled the world.

THE END
Well, here we are in the headquarters.
Well, here we are in the headquarters.
Well, here we are in the headquarters.
Well, here we are in the headquarters.

Well, here we are in the headquarters.
Well, here we are in the headquarters.
Well, here we are in the headquarters.
Well, here we are in the headquarters.
Well, here we are in the headquarters.
Yes, it's two of them.
Young Lieutenant Maria Ross.
Puntier Officer Danny Blosh.
Welcome, Sir Steel Alchemist.
Welcome, Sir Steel Alchemist.
The second name is quite fitting for both appearance,
you are impressively looking.
It happens all the time, but ...
Yes, I'm used to it.
So, this little one ...
Yes, I'm used to it.
No, no, I just did not expect it to be a child.
That's all, enough!
Major, we don't need security. We're all right now.
Let me disagree with you. Unfortunately...
We've received reliable information that there's a new scar in the headquarters.
That's right. We'll have to be patient a little longer.
Mr. Steel Alchemist, can you count on us?
All right, just don't get confused.
There's a car waiting for you.
I'm sorry. He's always like that. Please don't pay attention to him.
He had to go through a lot, and it affected his character.
Please treat it with respect.
All right, but...
Because of the fire that happened last night, the first department almost completely burned down.
No.
It can't be.
According to the eyewitnesses, we can assume that this is a crime of the hand of the scar.
Brother, our trail has turned into ashes.
Yes! Honestly, I'd like you to hear her. She's a genius.
And this is in three years.
She sings like an angel.
In the future, I'll find a job.
Mr. Colonel, I'm working right now.
What? That's a coincidence. I'm also working.
That's right. Isn't there an alchemical technique to burn the subscriber through the phone line?
You have scary thoughts, Fire Alchemist.
That's enough about our case.
According to the eyewitnesses, there is no doubt that the scar is involved in the fire.
However, the inspection of the scene shows that he could not do this alone.
There are traces of a fight left.
What did you find out about the scar?
The traces of the fight stretch to the channel beyond the building.
Below, his clothes, stained with blood, were found.
It is not yet clear whether he is alive or not.
There are rumors in the headquarters that after the death of Brigadier General Grant, a certain Colonel Mustang will return here.
However, there are those who for some reason believe that you are behind this whole story.
Stupidity.
However, does returning to the headquarters mean?
Not bad.
Be careful. You have enough weapons, enemy.
I'm ready for that.
Try to get the team out of the acid as soon as possible.
Who understands you and supports you.
And you should finally get married.
Shut up!
Colonel, be careful with the phone.
Colonel, don't sit there.
The search was going on all morning, but only these books could be collected.
It's a nightmare.
Brother.
Unfortunately, there are no books of the author Timo Marco in the main library.
If she had been transferred from the department, then it should have remained in the records.
Is there a chance that this book was taken by the reader?
Yes, yes, of course, but the records about the release of the book also burned down.
That's how it is.
Most likely she burned down with the others.
If only you could check if this book was left there.
Tell me, who else has been working here lately?
There are only two in this department.
He and I.
Only two?
Access to the department was only available to state alchemists.
It seemed to me that there was another girl in glasses.
Probably Cheska.
She was fired not so long ago.
Fired?
She was a little strange.
Cheska was a book worm.
Worm?
Apparently not at home.
The light is on.
Let's open it.
It can't be!
These are all books!
Does anyone really live here?
Cheska, are you here?
Cheska!
Cheska!
Apparently not.
Cheska!
Cheska!
Cheska!
Cheska!
Cheska!
Apparently not.
Help!
Help!
A man!
Let go of the man!
Open!
Thank you very much.
I accidentally touched the top of the book.
It was even difficult to breathe.
I thought it was over.
Cheska, you used to work in the first department of the library.
Yes.
During work, I read books.
I was fired for that.
I need to send money to my sick mother.
I can't do anything but read books.
Cheska, maybe you will remember.
Was there a book by the author Timo Marco in the first department of the library?
Timo Marco?
I think it was a rather thick scientific treatise written by hand.
A thick scientific treatise written by hand.
Timo Marco.
Yes, I remembered.
It's a handwritten in leather.
Right?
Oh, that's right.
Yes.
I remember all the books that were in the first department.
That is, it means ...
Damn, everything again from the beginning.
Brother.
Yes, when can you find the book you want to read?
It's so sad.
I understand your feelings very well.
It happened that I cried for three days in this mountain book,
but I could not find the one I wanted to read.
It was so sad, so sad.
Cheska, thank you.
We found out that the book was there.
But now we have to come up with something.
Seriously?
Is there any way?
Now I will turn the books into books.
Wow!
You really can do it.
Look carefully.
Is it okay that it flew away?
This is absolutely impossible, brother.
If this is so necessary, let me rewrite this book for you.
If I read the book once, then I remember all its contents.
I have already read almost all the books that were in the first department.
It's true.
You really can do it.
My unnecessary ability is good, although it will serve someone.
I'm sorry for the delay.
The volume was very large.
It took me three whole days to rewrite everything.
This book is for Mr. Markov, right?
It's so big.
Yes.
Everything from simple, easy snacks to dinners with guests.
The author is Tim Markov.
Today's menu is one of the thousand best recipes.
Yes.
Sugar, one tablespoon, salt, pepper to taste.
This is really today's menu.
Maybe the author was wrong.
What are you?
I just rewrote exactly what I was told.
It's a waste of time.
No.
Are you sure that all this until the last line and letters are as it was written by Tim Markov?
Yes.
There are no mistakes.
You're just a treasure.
Thank you.
Young lieutenant, give this money to the police.
According to the request of the organization of state alchemists,
they give money from my budget for research.
Al, let's go.
Wait.
Officer, here.
I wonder what he will do with this book.
Yes, it's interesting.
Huh?
How much?
That's a lot of money.
What state alchemists?
Wait.
Where are you going?
For some time we will stay in the central library.
There are a lot of documents and documents.
How come?
We still don't know what happened to the scar.
How can we protect you in such a crowded place?
Then report to this administration or whatever is supposed to be there.
This is our problem.
We just found the trace that we were looking for for so long.
Sorry.
Mr. Markov's treatise.
Perhaps at first glance this is a culinary book, but ...
Somewhere here the secret of the philosophical stone is described.
It is encrypted to prevent the use of it in evil.
By the way, they say that alchemy was born in the kitchen.
A couple of empty boxes.
If I take up this case, I will.
I thought I would solve it right away.
What a complicated code.
If you asked Mr. Markov directly ...
He dropped the investigation.
No more.
I'm not going to do it.
I'm going to do it.
I'm going to do it.
I'm going to do it.
I'm going to do it.
I'm going to do it.
I'm going to do it.
I'm going to do it.
I'm going to do it.
I'm going to do it.
I'm going to do it.
I'm going to do it.
I'm going to do it.
I'm going to do it.
No.
It's impossible to rely on it.
Hello.
How are you holding?
Lieutenant colonel.
It's been a long time since we saw you.
Thanks for this scar.
I'm tearing apart.
You were flung, right?
They have to return to their room in the headquarters.
I asked you to leave us alone!
Since we don't know where the scar is,
we need to reconsider the security system.
Probably the youngest Lieutenant Ross is right.
Lieutenant Colonel!
However, I can't take this on my responsibility.
Try to contact Major Armstrong.
No, not him!
Lieutenant Colonel!
There's just a little bit left. Please.
Because of this scar, we can't do anything now.
Almost all the records are burned down,
and there's almost nothing to work with.
The records?
They were also in that department.
Yeah.
Witness statements and list of names.
That's it.
Lieutenant Colonel.
What?
Me?
I read the police reports and lists of suspects, however...
Everything will work out.
Well, if that's the case, you'll help us a lot.
I'm rooting for her.
She's perfect for this job.
I don't have any abilities,
except for the fact that I read books.
And I'm going to work in the military court.
That's not true.
If you can give up any job,
that's what talent is.
You have incredible memory.
You just have to believe in yourself.
Thank you.
I'll do my best.
Are you ready to start working?
Great.
Once you've decided,
we'll make everything official.
We have good complaints.
Thank you very much.
What are you going to do?
I'll send people from the military court
to protect the library.
What?
Thank you.
What?
Thank you, of course,
although I don't want that at all.
You're lying.
Bye.
Don't get too tired.
Wait, Lieutenant.
Young Lieutenant Ross,
I know what you want to tell me,
but they're not easy to get away with.
Tomorrow I'll come to help you with my people.
In the meantime, I ask you to take care of my brother.
Think of it as an order.
Why do you listen to them?
You let them work despite the danger.
They're still just kids.
That's why we protect them.
What they're doing now
can't be done by anyone else.
The task of adults is to protect such children,
isn't it?
I hope for you.
Brother!
Let's go!
It looks like you're the communists.
That's right.
That means there are still those
who believe in our existence.
I couldn't eat it.
I wanted to check Mark's research,
but now there's no need for that.
You woke up?
That's great.
I didn't think you'd recover.
Where am I?
You're Ishvarits, aren't you?
Yeah.
Don't worry.
This is the city of Ishvarts.
Grandpa!
He's alive!
Oh!
Young man!
You think you were born anew?
You're right.
I was born anew.
They're looking for you, aren't they?
Don't worry.
We don't give up our people here.
Never.
It turns out there are so many
Ishvarts left.
And not only here.
In every region there are small villages
where Ishvarts live.
We're all in this world
in the hands of our god Ishvar.
God Ishvar.
Well?
No results today?
I don't know what they're studying,
but it would be better if they quit earlier.
These kids won't give up
until they graduate.
Our job is to protect them.
Damn it!
Now I understand why they were talking
about the devil's research
and the reason why Mark
quit his research.
Brother.
Of course.
The raw material for the Philosopher's Stone
is living people.
What? What happened?
I thought...
I thought that we finally
reached our goal.
You're leaving?
Thank you for everything.
Why don't you stay?
I can't.
I stepped back from the path of God.
You have such a cool hand.
Yes.
This is a valuable family relic.
The End
The End
The fifth lab of the Central.
There was hell they were talking about.
