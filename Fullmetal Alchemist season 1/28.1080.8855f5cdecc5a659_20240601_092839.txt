Oh, that's it. It seems she wants us to stay here for a while. Now we won't have any problems because we've been left here.
Yes, and the use of alchemy is prohibited. Just like back then, during training.
Maybe the teacher thinks that we haven't grown at all during this time. Yes, Al?
No.
Wait! Al!
Don't turn around. You'll fall.
Okay.
What do you intend to do?
Well, how can I say what?
Yes.
What do you mean, yes? They left them on an uninhabited island. I don't understand.
You don't understand, do you?
Yes, I do.
What is it? What are you thinking about?
Sometimes you can think like this. Sometimes you need to stop and think calmly about everything.
When a person wants to get something, he needs to sacrifice something.
Thus, if you want to get something, you have to give something equal in return.
In alchemy, this is called the law of equal exchange.
At that time, we believed that this is the truth that rules the world.
The End
The End
Al, do you want to run away?
It's impossible. I can't swim.
By the way, me too.
So, we're not like before.
It's great, brother.
Exactly. We haven't been on such excursions for a long time.
Excursions?
No.
Here, take this.
A knife?
This is an uninhabited island.
No electricity, no well, no house where you can hide from the rain.
Wild animals? I don't think so.
You are the only ones who should live on this island for a month.
You are not allowed to use alchemy all this time.
What is it?
What is it?
In a month I will come for you.
What? Wait!
It's all one, one, it's all.
If you don't find the answer in a month, I'll send you back to Rezimburg. Bye!
It's all one, one, it's all.
Now it's clear. However, back then...
Yes, it was completely unclear what it was about.
It's all one, one, it's all.
Damn aunt gave us some kind of incomprehensible homework.
It's all one, one, it's all. What does it mean?
It's all a mystery, a mystery. Completely incomprehensible.
However, if we don't find the answer in a month, there will be no basic training.
What is this nonsense? What kind of alchemy training? This aunt fooled us!
We will sleep.
Tomorrow we will get up early and look for breakfast.
Al, are you going to the toilet?
What is it, brother? At least you can go to the toilet.
Idiot, wake up!
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way! If we run away from here, we will be taught a lesson!
He is a scoundrel!
Damn it! Run!
What is it? Did I really get lost?
Don't eat me! I'm not tasty!
Brother, it's me!
Al, how nice! I thought I was lost!
A fox.
Two.
A fox.
How is it?
Oh, oh!
Dinner is served!
Dry yourself as you should, otherwise you will get rusty.
Okay.
Who was it? Scary, terribly scary!
She said that there are no wild animals!
But there are who are scarier than wild animals!
What are we going to do?
What to do, what to do?
They will come for us only in a month.
First of all, we can't fight on a hungry stomach.
We did it!
We have food!
After all, you can catch if the right trap!
How are we going to eat it?
We will cut it!
We will cut it!
We will cut it!
We will cut it!
No, it's still you!
No, brother, let it be you!
I never killed animals! I can't!
And me too!
It's not fair! You always make me do the most unpleasant work!
What are you talking about?
Stop!
You won't get away!
Brother!
How are you? What a wound!
This is the devil!
Brother!
Where did this creature go?
Brother!
Oh, she has children!
Is this mom?
Yes.
Let's not eat meat, let's eat fish!
What do you think, hungry fox?
Calm down!
Fire!
Hooray!
Are you ready?
Brother!
What is it?
Enough, let's go!
Oh, it hurts!
What is it?
I'm asking you!
Are you hungry to eat like this?
No, it's not me!
But there are fingerprints here!
Look carefully!
This is the right hand!
Ah!
After all, someone is there!
Is there?
It can't be!
Listen, Al, maybe that's why the teacher brought us here?
Ed, where are you going?
Let's check!
At the same time, we will look for food!
We will not give up!
There are 28 days left!
A month later
Who is it?
It's me.
I'm so sorry.
I know that I'm not in the right place.
Oh, don't be.
Don't worry.
I've been here many times.
And you?
I don't know.
Go to the bathroom.
I'll be right back.
I have to go.
I'll be back.
I can't.
I have to go.
I have to go.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
What will happen if you and I die here?
No, Winry and Granny will be upset.
I still want to do so much in life.
What does it have to do with alchemy?
Enough! I want to go home!
Where is he? This guy...
And here is food for my brother.
Ed! Look! Look!
Ed? What's wrong with him?
Al, did you call me?
Ed? Then who is Al?
Al!
Cicada!
Look at her! She's dead!
Death!
If we die, it will be the same with us!
Let me go, Al!
Let me go!
Al!
Al!
We said what will happen if we die here.
We said everyone will be upset.
It's subjective.
And if you look at it objectively,
if I die, the world will continue to rotate as if nothing happened.
Because you are a tiny creature.
If a little creature like me dies,
my body will remain.
Water, carbon, amniac, iron, phosphorus,
potassium, salt, sulfur, magnesium,
fluoride, manganese, aluminum.
Exactly!
No more than a combination of these and some other elements.
That's what my body is.
Ultimately, the fate of the body is to be processed by bacteria
and become food for plants.
These plants will become food for herbivorous animals.
And herbivorous animals will become food for herbivorous animals.
That's how everything goes in a circle,
even if we don't realize it.
I'm sorry.
The invisible eye is a huge stream.
I don't know how to call it space or the world.
I and Al are small parts of this huge stream.
One in all.
However, if you collect all these units, you get everything.
And this world flows according to the law, so huge
that we can't even imagine it.
To understand this flow, to decompose it into components,
to create it anew.
It can be alchemy.
30 days.
And breakfast.
So this day has come.
Do you understand that everything is one and one is everything?
Everything is the world.
One is me.
Good.
Let's move on to your training.
Great!
We haven't found that man yet.
Oh well.
At least we understood what the teacher wanted to tell us.
Yes.
Then we'll go with you.
Yes.
Then we came to this answer.
But it turned out to be not enough.
In fact, we should have understood then
that the transmutation of the mother was a mistake.
Maybe everything we are trying to do now
the teacher probably knew it too.
Did you remember?
Yes.
Did you understand?
Teacher, did you want to tell us?
We tried to revive our mother with the help of transmutation.
And this is what we have as a result.
That's why we want to get everything back.
What you lost by making a mistake,
you want to get back by making a mistake again.
Maybe we are wrong.
But then what should we do?
We move forward.
Because we live.
Is this your decision?
Yes.
If so, is there someone there?
What are you talking about?
There has been someone on this island for a long time.
Maybe the man in the mask?
No, of course not.
Because it was me.
What does it mean?
He was looking for you.
But now is not the time to talk about it.
