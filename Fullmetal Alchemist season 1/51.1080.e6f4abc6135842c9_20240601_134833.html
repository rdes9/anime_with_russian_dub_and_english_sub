        <pre>I'm still in a daze
I want to get rid of my distorted image
Because I see my limits there
My self-contained emotions are in the window
I can't find my own calendar
I'll erase it, rewrite it
I'll erase this stupid feeling
I'll erase this forgotten existence
I'll rewrite it, rewrite it
I'll erase your empty imagination
I'll rewrite it, rewrite it
Ed!
These people won't last long
Ed! Ed! No! He can't die!
Died?
Yes, he died
All people will die one day
And only homunculi will remain
He couldn't die
It's impossible
Ed! Ed!
Is it reality?
Or did he pay too little?
Payment is always insufficient
Ed!
Hey, are you all right?
Colonel Archer
I'm taking this car
Colonel, where?
To the Fuhrer's house
The robbers went there
It's a mistake
Senior Lieutenant Hawkeye is here
Hawkeye?
Why is she here?
Stop!
The Fuhrer ordered to interrogate her in the headquarters
What were you thinking?
Get out of the way!
Colonel! Colonel!
The Fuhrer ordered to interrogate her in the headquarters
This is the end of my life
I was just wondering what would happen if this body burned down
Did you really want to become a Fuhrer?
Cheap love is so predictable
But you should have thought a little longer
After a deliberate murder, you will not be able to achieve the highest
I just couldn't forgive myself for my own stupidity
Because of this, my close friend died
This is all I could do for him
So go and apologize to him
Say hello to your husband
Father?
Don't be afraid, I caught the Fuhrer
Father, I'm sorry I broke your order
But I wanted to be useful to you
Because you took me to yourself
He is one of those who you call a fool
Father, what happened?
What did you do?
I took this from the safe
If the fire starts, something can happen to the treasures
Father!
Father!
Father!
That's why I say that you are fools
How many times do I have to kill you?
So that you die
Father!
Father!
Father!
Father!
Father!
Father!
Don't!
What? What did you do?
Fried food
Alchemical decomposition
Alchemical decomposition
What is this?
I told you not to use alchemy
It has decreased again
Don't come any closer
Don't touch me
What are you doing?
Ed is not dead yet
He is so warm
His soul is still inside the gate
I just need to return it
What he did for me
In no case, if you do it
I became a philosophical stone
By taking countless human sacrifices
Probably
I died that day
So
Be careful
Brother
Brother
Brother
Colonel! Colonel!
Colonel! Roy Mustang!
Al
Al
What is it?
Where am I?
This is the gate
Where are they leading?
In my case
It was a city called London
That is, my father told me so
Guggenheim is light?
Yes
Is this guy still alive?
Better don't try
It is not known what will happen
I will find Guggenheim
And kill him
Let me go
Where Guggenheim is
Where is he?
Do not disturb me
I'm going
Where is Guggenheim?
Where is he?
Where is my father?
Al
Al
Ed
Are you alive?
Yes
Why tears?
Al
Al
Transmuted you
Your dead body
With the help of his stone
He resurrected my soul and body
What with Al?
What with Al?
That is, Al disappeared
Al
Al
Al

Where are you from? What are you doing here?
You're hungry. Wait. You recognize me, don't you?
You're hungry. Wait. You recognize me, don't you?
Get out of here. I'm sorry. Could you take him away?
What about you, Ed?
I'm going to destroy this place so that no one else will look for the Philosopher's Stone.
That's right. And then you'll be able to get out?
After all, now you have wonderful legs.
If what Father said is true, now the soul and body of Alla are inside the gate,
and I have nothing to pay for except for my life.
Maybe if I give up everything, nothing will work, but at least you won't disappear.
Come back, Alla.
Hello, everyone. How are you?
In the Central, everything has finally calmed down.
After the disappearance of the Fuehrer, the government surprisingly quickly fell into the hands of the government,
and the army gave the right to make political decisions to the Parliament.
However, it seems that the wars with the countries that have complaints against us will continue.
Despite all this, the policy towards Ishvar has changed, and I would like to believe that everything will slowly improve.
I think Brigadier General Mustang will recover soon.
Stop looking at me like that.
Your plan was perfect. However, due to the fact that I didn't make it in time...
There are no perfect plans. This world is imperfect. That's why it's beautiful.
What's going on with Alfons?
They say that when he was found, he was ten years old again.
It's very strange, but he seems to have lost all his memories,
starting from the day when they found him.
I don't know what happened to him.
I don't know what happened to him.
It's very strange, but he seems to have lost all his memories,
starting from the day when they tried to resurrect their mother together.
He still doesn't remember anything that happened.
And Edward is no more.
Teacher!
Edward is no more.
The human transmutation will not be successful just because they paid for it with their lives.
Perhaps Alan's pay is four lost and forgotten years.
Alan has been reading books on alchemy for a long time,
as if it were in order not to forget Edward.
And this boy is angry.
Winry made him an auto armor made for Ed.
And where is Ed now?
No one knows.
That's how it is.
Do you want to go to school again?
Yes, to the teacher.
Why not?
I want to know more about alchemy, about equal exchange,
and I want to meet my brother again.
I don't know what to do.
But if I study alchemy, I will meet my brother again.
I think so.
Alan, can I?
How can you refuse?
Alan, just promise me something.
I will also study a lot and become a better auto armor mechanic.
So promise me that you will come back.
That you will come back alive and healthy.
Don't worry, I will learn.
I will find my brother and come back.
That's enough for today.
Thank you for being with us, Professor Guggenheim.
Are you really studying magic?
In the myths, the island of Thule is mentioned.
We call ourselves the community of Thule.
And we believe that God lives on that island,
and we are looking for a way to him.
I hope for your help in the future.
I am also looking for a way, Professor Househofer.
14 marks for one thing, and 14 marks for another.
But how much more will this inflation continue?
What are you doing, Edward?
Look.
A rocket with liquid fuel?
Goddard?
He is an American, but there is another researcher
who is engaged in the same problem in Transylvania.
You are not talking about Dracula?
His name is Robert. He is still a student, but I will meet him.
And what then?
He is thinking about going into space with a rocket.
Maybe if I go into space, I can get closer to my world.
There is also an ether there.
Haven't you read Einstein?
There is a lot of controversial stuff there.
You apply metal chemistry to engineering, don't you?
I wanted to resurrect him by connecting his soul and body.
But when I came to myself, I was alone in this world.
In order not to lose your body and mind,
you had no choice but to run here.
You did it unconsciously.
However, I again lost the fact that Alice did not return me with such difficulty.
Everything cannot be perfect, because this world is imperfect.
I wanted to transport Alan by offering my life in return.
But I'm still alive.
Maybe I got something without bringing anything in return?
Or maybe Alan is still ...
You have gone through the path of those people you met.
And you are still alive.
You have gone through the path of those people you met.
What you saw, the pain, the effort, everything you went through.
Maybe that was your price.
Here.
I don't know how to get back to you yet.
But I will definitely come back.
See you, Alan.
In order to get something, you need to sacrifice something.
In this way, if you want to get something, you have to give something equal in return.
In alchemy, this is called the law of equal exchange.
Once we believed that this is the truth that rules the world.
But the real world is imperfect and there is no law that would explain everything.
This concerns the law of equal exchange.
But no matter what, I believe that people cannot get anything without paying the price.
The pain we suffered was the price we paid.
And any person who pays with his own efforts will surely get something.
The law of equal exchange is not the law of the universe.
My brother and I promised each other that we would meet again.
The End
