        <pre>This is... Resinburg?
Yes.
Well, excuse me, province.
Oh, he's looking again!
What happened?
He was still in the train, all the time looked at me.
Oh, do you understand what's the matter?
To be a beauty is so important!
Excuse me, aren't you Sarah?
How did you grow up?
Your beauty!
He makes me angry.
He pretends that we know each other.
Sarah!
Sarah!
Sarah!
Sarah!
Sarah, this is...
This is my mom's name.
What?
You said you were going to study in Rush Valley.
And all this time you were in the city center?
No, I was looking for Ed and Alan.
Well, well.
And when are these two coming back?
Oh, by the way, we met your friends in Rush Valley.
Grandma, we're not here.
We're tired of you.
Wait a minute.
The power of love!
So you're back.
By the way, I can't find my house.
Are you looking for your house?
It's over there.
Grandma, do you know him?
Well, yes, you were still a little girl.
This is Father Ed and Alan.
Yes, I haven't been here for so long that I can't find my own house.
Philosopher's Stone.
Those who have acquired it do not depend on the law of equal exchange.
And in order to get something, they no longer have to give equal exchange.
We were looking for it and got it.
What do you want to spit out?
Because there is no other proof of existence.
My future, which I should have grasped,
is full of dignity and freedom.
What do you want to erase?
Because I see my own limits there.
My own emotions are in the window.
I can't find my own calendar.
I can't find my own calendar.
I can't find my own calendar.
Erase it!
Relight it!
Stupid delusions!
Forget about the existence!
Make it disappear!
Relight it!
Your meaningless imagination!
I'll defeat you, but I'm a warrior!
Give me your hand!
Oh yeah!
What's wrong with you today, bitch?
I feel so light now.
If you're tired, let's take a break.
You can't.
Probably what you said is true.
What about the Fuhrer and Bradley?
This man, the Fuhrer, he's a homunculus!
This time, the Fuhrer himself commands the operation.
I don't think envy replaced him.
And besides, the Fuhrer's secretary is also a homunculus.
And if we return to the army, then you and me...
So this is the secretary?
Don't say that!
But the teacher said that homunculi appear as a result of poor human transmutation.
I told you not to say that!
This is...
What was that just now?
Such huge gates!
I've seen them before.
Ed, is there a truth behind them?
No, the teacher said that the truth is not in this.
I just touched you. Why?
I'm an alchemist.
Probably unconsciously caused a reaction with your stone.
Ed, do you believe that I became a philosopher's stone?
I don't feel it.
Could the philosopher's stone be like this?
No one has ever seen it.
So don't be surprised, no matter how it looks.
You can't touch me now.
Ed!
If you touch me, there will be a transmutation reaction again.
Everything will be in vain if you disappear before we return your body.
Ed, where are you going?
To Risenburg.
This will be the first place where they will look for us.
Homunculi will probably hunt for you.
To defeat them, we need to take something.
Stop anybody!
It was established that the death of Kimble took place before the dawn.
However, at that moment Shuram was still alive.
It was also established that peaceful residents ran out of the city
before the army began an attack.
An underground passage was discovered.
Now we are moving forward.
This means that they weren't going to resist.
It was planned to use the soldiers as raw material, and the whole city as an alchemical circle.
With Ed and Alla, everything is fine.
Several soldiers confirmed that they saw them outside the city.
About an hour ago, Ed, accompanied by Alla, left from here.
Did they really set off again? However...
It can't be that they helped Shram in creating the Philosopher's Stone.
Colonel!
28 people have died, 67 people have been seriously injured.
I have five officers under my command.
About 900 people have disappeared without a trace.
The investigation of what happened continues.
There must be someone who knows for sure.
Shram? Maybe.
Steel.
No, both of the Elric brothers.
Do you know the reason why they came to Leor?
I think they were after Shram.
Why? Did they get the order to capture Shram?
No. They were ordered to check the region's alchemical research.
They appeared in Leor and got in touch with Shram.
It turns out that the results of this are about a thousand casualties among officers and soldiers.
But you can't put the Felric brothers to shame on the basis of assumptions and assumptions.
I think we should give them a chance to explain themselves.
Can you catch them on your own?
Good.
However, if you miss, you will be responsible for it yourself this time.
This is for your company.
According to my information,
there is a possibility that the Elric brothers are in a meeting with suspicious persons called homunculi.
Take them and bring them here.
I also give permission to judge them in case of a successful capture and execute the sentence on the spot.
Colonel?
Did you hear the order?
Collect all the information from the witnesses.
Well, are we going to catch Ed and Alla?
We got an order.
But it was Shram and Archer who did it.
They are to blame for their crazy attack.
I don't know what happened there, but the brothers...
The brothers ran away.
And if we let them go, the colonel will have problems.
But he was told to kill them as soon as you catch them.
Let's go, colonel.
Yes.
Did you spend the night here again?
Hello.
I think I lost count of time.
How many years have passed since Trisha's death?
Six years.
I see.
The children must be very sad.
Sarah Rockbill,
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Sarah Rockbill?
Sarah, is that you?
I told you already.
My name is Winry.
My mom's name is Sarah.
I see.
It's war.
It's not just a war.
They were shot and killed by their own people.
They treated their own people and their enemies.
It's sad.
Don't say that.
It's not just sad.
I know
who killed my parents.
And that this man is not bad.
That's why I can't do anything.
That's why?
That's why it's sad.
Sarah Rockbill,
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
It's not like that.
No.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Sarah, I'm sorry.
Sarah, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm very sorry.
Sarah, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
You've been following us! We saw what we shouldn't have seen!
You've been following us!
Cheska!
Cheska!
I didn't know that these guys didn't have a home anymore.
What about them? Why are they wanted?
There was an urgent call from the East.
The Fuhrer ordered the capture of the steel alchemist and his younger brother.
It is believed that they were connected to the leaders of the rebellion in Leor.
Oh, brothers! And what now?
A friend told us about this from the information department.
At the moment, a investigative group is being formed under the leadership of General Hakuro.
They must have already contacted the local police.
And then the junior lieutenant suddenly took a vacation.
I thought it was a date.
What's wrong with breathing fresh air?
Yes, go to those who are in search to tell everything.
What are you doing?
Even if it's the Fuhrer's order, I still don't believe it.
What are these two traitors?
Well, yes.
But will they come here?
Yes.
Yes, they will come here.
Even if they don't have a home here, this is their hometown.
And besides, you are here.
There was no railway here before.
And there was no ordinary road from this village to the East.
Everyone walked through the pass and into that valley.
The valley.
We used to play there.
That's right. This hall will surely come from that side.
Thank you, uncle.
Uncle.
Let's go.
Rose, Blosch, wait for us here.
If a investigative group appears, we will slow them down.
Thank you.
There was no railway.
This is more than a hundred years ago.
Let's go.
Oh, let's hide.
Ed!
Later. Let's hide.
So, is everything just for the sake of your career?
I don't think so.
Didn't you hear?
If we let Felrik's brothers go,
the responsibility for everything that happened in Leor will be on him.
Colonel?
If that's the case, you won't do anything.
Are you Edward?
As the colonel expected.
You walked through this old road.
Well, let's go.
Let me through.
Edward.
I won't come back to the army.
Come on, shoot.
Let's see what happens to you after the shot in the armored car.
Edward, why?
Come on, shoot.
Stop.
Hewok.
We won't come back.
Never.
Alla, let's go.
I'm sorry.
Stop.
Edward.
If you have a reason, tell us.
We are not your enemies.
Until the end of the official investigation, you are considered innocent.
That's enough for now.
These two.
Did they really become our enemies?
We'll catch them and figure it out.
Don't interfere with the personal composition next time.
Colonel,
here in the chest pocket...
Get better.
They couldn't go far yet.
Probably because he can't let Alfonso get wet.
Because of that blood stain.
The road, the road!
The road!
Who were you listening to?
About the Hellric brothers?
Who?
Do you think they are traitors?
We'll figure it out when we find them.
You tricked Edward and Alla into the army!
And now you...
This man is not interested in anything but his career.
Answer me!
You did the same thing to my father and mother!
Ed!
Careful, don't touch me by accident.
We don't know what will happen...
Ed!
Why are you running away?
It's all my fault!
Aren't you going to chase us away?
If you chase a dog, it will run away.
Good dog listens to its owner.
Owner, you say?
Or did you suddenly become wild again?
Calm down, Edward.
Didn't you say you were ready to be called an army dog to achieve your goals?
I'm done with the army.
And what?
Did you become a foolish child again?
Call me whatever you want.
You're too weak, colonel.
Alla!
Major!
Yes, sir!
I fell!
Your humble servant made hollow stones.
By squeezing the air inside, I blew them up.
I guess it turned out to be effective.
You were right to take advantage of the scoundrel.
Edward!
Stop!
I beg you!
Wait!
It's my fault.
I killed two people a long time ago.
They were doctors.
There was no one for them among the patients.
That's what they said and treated everyone at the front.
However, the people they saved were our enemies.
And many times they ordered to stop treating our enemies.
But they didn't listen.
They gave me an order and I shot them both.
And then I swore.
If they give me a ridiculous order, I will not follow it.
I will achieve such a state in which I will not have to follow orders.
I chased you not by order, but because I called on you.
Why?
Why did you run away without asking for my help?
Edward!
