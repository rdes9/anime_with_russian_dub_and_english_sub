That's how greed died, I would say that death was in his style, everything happened so
cruelly and angrily that I think he died beautifully, but if the length became smaller, he will do it again, by the way, for the new anger that we have found now,
watching lazily to teach him what happened, it can't be that you felt from the fact that greed is not because of him,
but just in my head suddenly came up the idea of where we came from and where we are going,
gentlemen, I'm already closing the establishment, we'll live here for now, gentlemen, we don't need to go anywhere,
is this not enough? Hey, are you deaf? Don't make noise! Can I eat it? I'll treat you, you can't hurry.
And in fact, I thought about it before, where I came from and where I'm going.
Hold on, hold on, Jimmy, I'm sorry, let me go, please show it to me.
Now everything is fine! Thank you so much!
When a person wants to get something, he needs to sacrifice something.
Thus, if you want to get something, you have to replace something equal.
In alchemy, this is called the law of equal exchange.
At that time, we believed that this is the truth that rules the world.

Ed, do you think this is the right way?
No doubt, we are heading south.
And we will definitely come across the Ishvarts' camp along the way.
That would be good.
Do you think we can really find out something about Ishvarts?
We have no other clues.
I don't want the homunculus to pull me over the strings.
What happened?
I think I just heard a woman's cry.
No!
Who are you?
Bastards, you're going to pay for this.
What are you blabbering about?
We haven't seen each other in two years, have we?
It's incredible that I've met you again.
I have so much to tell you.
But first, maybe you can tell me why you disappeared.
Why did you disappear without saying anything?
I don't remember what happened so long ago.
And I remember that you taught me a lot.
And alchemy, and something more important.
And why are you here?
You never left the village before.
Well, it's to find a new stone.
You remember, thanks to the philosophical stone
that you gave me, our village was saved.
However, this disease has appeared again.
And it seems that the power of the stone weakens.
I beg you, will you help me become stronger?
Once again, like then.
Climbing.
What a nuisance.
You can eat. You can eat this.
No, you can't.
You should go on a diet.
The girls are lucky.
Please, take this with you.
Thank you.
This is it.
Take these herbs to the village, please.
There.
They are there.
Hey, how are you there?
Livia, Livia.
Hold on, Livia.
Forgive me, Budyon.
This is it.
I asked you not to do this.
It won't help.
You were very lucky.
You were also in the cart.
Nevertheless, you should get out of here as soon as possible.
In this area, the epidemic of stoning is spreading.
Stoning?
I will help.
I will get rid of the epidemic with the help of my alchemy.
So, you went alone to find a man named Luzyon?
Yes.
I don't know why you decided to do this,
but girls shouldn't travel alone.
Yes.
But I was so afraid that I would never meet Luzyon again.
Never.
Listen, why did this Luzyon leave your village?
To find a new villager.
A villager?
A stone?
Yes.
In order to stop the epidemic of stoning in our village,
which is not treated with any medicine,
the strength of the stone is necessary.
It's a terrible disease.
So, Luzyon...
Drink.
Come on.
This will calm you down.
Thank you.
Well, that's great.
Now it will make you feel better.
Ah!
Livia, how are you?
Are you hurt?
I'm fine.
I just slipped out of my hand.
Luzyon, Luzyon, are you here?
Luzyon!
Luzyon!
Luzyon!
Luzyon!
Luzyon!
Luzyon!
Luzyon!
Luzyon!
Luzyon, are you here?
My son!
My son!
This is stoning disease.
The body quickly dries up and turns into a stone.
The man dies, dried up,
like a flower.
Let go of this nightmare.
Basilisk hears the cry of this child.
Basilisk answers his son's prayer.
Let the evil run in fear.
Let it let go and leave and be subdued.
Forgive me.
My son.
He was only eight years old.
He was only eight years old.
I can't do anything,
only pray to God.
The lives of the little Sikhs, save them!
God, God Ishvara, save your lives!
The lives of the little Sikhs, save them!
With the help of alchemy, lay out the dead body
and try to restructure it into its former form.
When the medicine doesn't work, that's the thought that comes to mind.
But you're too inexperienced in alchemy.
I'll teach you the true alchemy.
I'm so glad that you're coming back to us.
I said that I was leaving the village in search of the Philosopher's Stone,
but in fact I was hoping to meet you.
I wanted to meet you too.
I forgot something in this village, and it doesn't give me peace.
Don't worry, we're still going in that direction.
Thank you, but maybe it's wrong to return to the village.
What's left? We don't have any clues. You can't do anything.
I get it. This Ludzion is probably your fianc√©, right?
No, Ludzion left me. I've always loved him, and he...
and he really loved me.
So this is where you work.
You've collected a lot of books.
What are you doing?
It's mostly rubbish.
First of all, you need to acquire the necessary knowledge.
Read these books in order.
Then you'll master everything.
I don't understand. It's too difficult for me. It's impossible.
It's all right. You'll understand. You have talent.
Come on, believe in yourself.
Here it is again. Who is it? Why is it in my memories?
Yes, it's useful.
What is it?
My gift to you. This philosophical stone will increase your power.
It's useless to try to cure people right away.

First, use your power to bring this bird back to the sky.
God, save her and protect her, so that she does not fall off the path.
God, protect her so that during the day and night, when the sun and the moon shine,
she will not be harmed. God, save her and protect her.
She's alive!
I told you that you have talent.
It's all thanks to you. Thank you.
Can I ask you one more thing?
Why did you take it and disappear?
You knew that I felt it.
You can not look for answers to all questions at once.
Otherwise, you will ruin yourself.
I do not understand what you want to say.
Please, do not take Ludzion away.
Please, we are engaged.
We will get married when the stone epidemic is over.
Excellent! Congratulations!
I will speak to the speech, if you invite me to the wedding.
Do not joke like that. I'm serious.
Livia, with my power, I will save you.
God, save her and protect her, so that she does not fall off the path.
God, protect her and protect her, so that she does not harm her during the day and night,
when the sun and the moon shine.
Great! Great, Ludzion!
Heal my son!
It was great, Ludzion!
How are things going?
There's nothing to worry about.
Everything is going according to plan.
I rely on you.
That's why I spread this disease.
With the help of a false philosophical stone,
Luzon began to cure the disease.
But not for long.
Then I will take back the power that I gave him.
And then this man,
on the verge of despair,
will begin to look for a real philosophical stone.
And he will find it for us.
We do the same everywhere.
And all in order to find a person
who can create a philosophical stone.
Excuse me.
Oh, Livia.
Today you are as beautiful as ever.
Have you seen Luzon?
Isn't it time to start the ceremony?
I can't. I can't.
You taught me not only alchemy,
but something more important.
I feel it.
What are you talking about?
Stay with me.
Forever.
Forever.
Who are you?
Who is it?
Who are you?
You'd better go after her.
But...
Hurry up!
Passion!
Hurry!
Livia!
Is it possible?
I'm afraid.
The village is coming.
Wait for me
and my new power.
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
You saved us again.
Just like two years ago.
Do you remember?
Do you remember
the day I hugged you for the first time?
I love you.
But now everything will be different.
I won't let you go.
Don't go!
Don't go!
My baby!
My baby!
You are my little mistake.
Where did I come from
and where am I going?
Lutian!
Lutian!
Lutian!
Lutian, where are you?
Hey!
Livia!
Is it possible?
Ed!
It's...
