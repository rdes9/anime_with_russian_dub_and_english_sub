        <pre>Episode 1
Just a little more and you'll get it!
Excuse me for the intrusion.
Inside!
How is the space here?
Ugh, disgusting!
Get out of here!
I'm sick of this!
Get out!
I can't.
You won't be able to completely control my movements like this!
I'm not going to try my best with you.
I'll just stop you from moving a little.
I'll finish you off!
Are you all right?
I got a bump in my head.
Alfons Selrik, come with us to our master.
It's hard to take you with you.
I'll split your leg!
Let's go!
Wait!
When a man wants to get something, he has to do it.
When he wants to get something, he has to sacrifice something.
So, if you want to get something, you have to give something equal in return.
In alchemy, this is called the law of equal exchange.
At that time, we believed that this is the truth that rules the world.
The End
The End
The End
So, where are the boys now?
Alfons Selrik was taken away by some strangers.
And Edward went after them.
And this happened in front of your eyes?
They dropped this in the garden.
Devil's nest!
It seems that this is a bar on the outskirts of the city.
I'm worried about Alfons.
But you didn't do it.
If it was me, why would I kidnap him here?
Outside the forest, in this world, there are still battles going on.
The ashes of the battle burn the fire of new evil plans.
And the flame spreads further and further.
Why don't people want to stop fighting?
Not everyone can hide in the forest like you, thinking only about alchemy.
These boys are looking for philosophical stones.
And sooner or later, misfortune will fall on them.
Why don't you stop them?
They have to get to the answer with their own strength.
No matter how this answer turns out,
at least it will be different from your ideals.
Why don't you believe me?
Because I'm not like you in life and in alchemy.
Are you leaving?
Yes.
Well, goodbye, Izumi.
We won't see each other again.
I'm sorry.
I'm not a guest.
I know you're not coming.
Okay, I'm used to it.
Just don't touch my blood.
Because then I can disappear from this world.
Hey, guys, why did you become alchemists?
We were soldiers a long time ago.
During the Eastern War we were seriously wounded.
We were already on the battlefield.
During the Eastern War we were seriously wounded.
We were already on the verge of death
when we were brought to the military laboratory,
where we became experienced in experiments.
The fifth laboratory?
Exactly.
And he took us out of this damn laboratory.
Greed.
Greed.
He gave us a place where we could live.
That's exactly how it was.
Well, enough talking.
There are a lot of people on the streets
who don't want to live.
Taker?
Mr. Taker, is that you?
Don't take me for a fool.
I'm not here on my own will.
This gentleman turned us back into alchemists.
Oh, cool.
As Mr. Taker said, it's empty inside.
It's not me.
I didn't tell him that.
Nice to meet you, kid.
My name is Greed.
Let's be friends.
A sign of a robber.
You know about that, don't you?
I don't.
Greed and passion?
No.
It's the other way around.
We're enemies.
Then why?
You seem to be called Al.
What do you feel in an immortal body
when you only have a soul?
What do you feel in an immortal body
when you only have a soul?
Transmute only the soul
and attach it to something else.
That is, you never get hungry,
you never get tired,
and you never get old.
People call it eternal life.
Eternal life?
You kidnapped me
because you need it.
I'm very greedy.
I want money, I want women,
power, glory, everything.
I want everything in this world
and eternal life.
Do you understand?
You can give me this opportunity.
Help me.
If you refuse,
I'll take you apart
to understand the secret of your soul.
What nonsense.
You're a bad person.
If you want to think like that,
please.
But in such a situation,
no one will save you.
No one.
My older brother was with me.
Now he's probably already...
That's impossible.
I'll get my soul out of him.
You're such a bad person.
It wasn't a watch.
With such chains,
I can do something with alchemy.
Do something?
Calm down.
I'm sorry, Martell.
I forgot you were inside.
I love determined guys.
But one determination
is not enough.
To defeat me,
I need at least this.
What are you doing?
You were for one.
Then go!
I once died for this.
Hey, you could hit me even nicer, huh?
But this body is not immortal.
Brother! Brother!
Hey, please forgive me for such an insult.
Teacher?
Hey, please forgive me for such an insult.
Teacher?
Girl, who are you?
Teacher!
Wait, Edward Eilrich.
You're probably looking for your brother.
Did you follow me?
You just silently watched as you kidnapped Alla?
We're going to track them down now.
Your brother's safety is our main priority.
Enough talking!
We're going to attack the Chimer's nest.
He should be there.
Tell me, where is this place?
This is a bar called the Devil's Nest.
Oh, oh, oh.
You're so fiery.
You're the boss here.
Thank you for caring for my boys.
And now I'm going to take them.
That's impossible.
Exactly.
Ouch!
You're really impulsive.
You didn't break your fingers?
Teacher!
What a strange body you have.
Well, it's time I didn't get hurt.
That's what it means.
Then let's get serious.
Teacher, don't you have my brother?
That's what I should be asking you.
You can't be entrusted with anything.
After that I'll give you another lesson.
So get ready.
I'm sorry.
It's the Chimer's circle.
Can't you stand it?
I'm not used to fighting women.
I just want to know the secret of his transmutation and that's it.
And then?
I'll get eternal life and everything else.
That's not a conversation.
Yes!
Well, I told you.
It's impossible to hurt me from the outside.
Dear.
I've seen enough of you.
I can't take it anymore.
One more time.
I can't lose my...
children anymore.
Yes.
Come on, come on.
Do you want to fight again?
Come on, come on.
Here you are.
Izumi.
Teacher.
Oh, oh, oh.
You've worked too hard, girl.
Maybe that's enough of meaningless resistance?
I don't want to do it.
But you know what will happen.
Take your dirty weapons away from her.
Quickly.
Block the back entrance with a group of 5 and 7.
Surround the building with 3 and 9.
The rest to the central entrance.
And now the elder brother.
Well, the whole body is gathered.
Tucker.
Edward.
Well, that's it.
I won't forgive you.
You kidnapped Alla.
And also caused harm to the teacher.
Hey, hey.
Just teach me how to attach the soul.
And then I...
Shut up.
I'll take them, Alla and the teacher.
Be careful, brother.
It's a harmonica.
Don't you see?
Then everything is clear.
Well, what is it?
Neither one nor the other does not want to listen to me.
Teacher.
Well, I told you.
I'm called the absolute shield.
Teacher.
Hey, hey, driver.
Enough to pull the rubber.
Take care of the teacher.
Yes.
If you want to beat me, you must want to kill me.
Yes.
I will definitely beat you.
Black Hat.
Preparation for penetration completed.
Approaches from the street.
The clutch is set.
All this is useless.
You guys didn't understand what I'm talking about.
What?
You broke the taboo to get what you wanted.
I didn't think you'd live for the satisfaction of your desires.
You won't understand me.
Don't compare us to each other.
We are the same.
It doesn't matter who you are.
A man or a harmonica.
We live only to satisfy our desires.
Who are you talking about?
I know that you are looking for the Philosopher's Stone.
I don't care about the Philosopher's Stone.
I want to bring back Alla, my younger brother, his true form.
He will be happier than he is now.
What do you understand?
Is it possible to decide for someone?
I'm not going to negotiate with you.
You are a harmonica.
If you were born as a result of an error made by us in alchemy,
then we must correct this error with the help of alchemy.
Here it is.
I didn't want to scare you and show you this.
But you seem to be ready.
Let's talk seriously now.
This?
This is my true form.
Come here.
It doesn't hurt at all.
Really?
The matter from which my body consists is the same as everyone else's.
However...
Absolute shield.
I've never killed anyone before.
What do you mean?
That you lack a fighting spirit.
You won't beat me like that.
But it also applies to steel harmonicas.
Now I will show you a fighting spirit.
Who are you?
Hello.
Mr. Greed, we have military problems.
Commander.
You ruined such a show.
Now is not the time to demonstrate your cold bloodedness.
Don't fuss.
What can this kind of military do to us?
Kimble?
Bastard.
Traitor.
Greed.
I'm going.
Stop.
I'm going.
I'm going.
I'm going.
I'm going.
Bastard.
I'm going.
Stop.
I'm going.
You won't get away.
What is it?
Please, don't resist.
Resist? What are you talking about?
Lieutenant Colonel Archer is calling for you.
Ask for your assistance.
They're taking my brother.
I can't just...
This is an order from the lieutenant colonel.
