        <pre>I knew that you would come. You will surely understand me. There was a lot between us, but in fact, I and you are very similar.
Maybe that's why Edward doesn't want to meet me.
He doesn't want to use the Philosopher's Stone.
How strange. You were so eager to meet him. What happened?
We've gone a long way to get back what we lost. That's all for us.
Nina...
It hurts, Nina. But everything will be fine. I'm prepared.
The body, as well as the lives of the animals that had to be sacrificed.
It remains only to tie all this together with the help of the Philosopher's Stone.
How did you find out about the Philosopher's Stone?
I was just making conclusions. When I looked at Archer's wounds, I realized what had happened.
In the center of the event was the same Shrump.
Then I heard that you had run away and they were looking for you.
And Bradley wants only one thing from the Philosopher's Stone.
Did you know that the Fuhrer is a homunculus?
All right, all right. How many years do you think I spent in the fifth lab?
They often appeared there, and this man too.
This man?
The one who grows and directs the homunculus.
Wait, maybe this man...
We'll talk later. Now you have what they want most in the world.
Come on, give it to me. The real Philosopher's Stone.
Please, don't touch me.
I am the Philosopher's Stone.
So that's it. That's why I didn't come here.
Yes. If we use the Philosopher's Stone, it is not known what will happen to my body.
So as long as we don't investigate this issue...
Besides, he said that he had to do something with the homunculus before.
I understand that Bradley is worried about me, but I also want to return his former appearance.
If you know how...
Of course I will teach you how to use the Philosopher's Stone.
However, I would also like to use its power.
Equal exchange.
The Philosopher's Stone.
Those who have acquired it do not depend on the law of equal exchange.
And in order to get something, they should no longer give equal exchange.
We were looking for it and got it.
The Philosopher's Stone.
The Philosopher's Stone.
The Philosopher's Stone.
The Philosopher's Stone.
The Philosopher's Stone.
The Philosopher's Stone.
The Philosopher's Stone.
The Philosopher's Stone.
The Philosopher's Stone.
The Philosopher's Stone.
The Philosopher's Stone.
The Philosopher's Stone.
The Philosopher's Stone.
Almost everything is destroyed.
There is only the absolutely useless thing left.
What kind of man was your Dante?
The great alchemist inherited this coat.
I thought so.
You thought so?
She knew how to hide her real knowledge of alchemy.
Isn't that natural?
Even we decipher secret alchemical formulas.
She did it too carefully.
If you say that alchemy serves people, what is there to hide?
She made her choice.
She lived in this forest without meeting anyone.
And for what?
I thought you would be happy.
It turns out that you turned out to be an ordinary person.
I leave the forest and will live in the city.
Among the people who need me.
And you will live, receiving gratitude.
Then you can become one of the state alchemists,
who are now being recruited for service.
Why are you...
You can go.
Does it mean that you don't love people?
Why should I love them?
Useless egoistic creatures.
They only invented gunpowder,
as the endless wars began.
If they learn the secret of alchemy,
a great tragedy can take place.
Let it be so, but I am also a human.
And you too.
There was one name that could not be pronounced in her presence.
Goegenheim Svetliy.
My father?
Yes. It seems that only this was not burned.
A love letter from Goegenheim Dante.
Wait a minute. I met Dante.
She was already in the years.
She looked at least 20 years older than my father.
That's not the problem.
It says a year according to the Christian calendar.
Christian calendar?
It is based on an old religion that is no longer in use.
According to him, this letter was written four centuries ago.
What does it mean?
I don't know. Maybe it's just a coincidence and a name.
What if she was the one who controlled all the homunculi?
A bold idea.
But if that's the case, are you ready to fight?
I'm sorry. I can't.
I'm sorry. I can't help you with anything.
Don't worry. Then I'll do everything myself.
Teacher?
I'm sorry.
Fool.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Well, how are you?
If there is a war with the North, it will no longer be a civil war.
I'm sorry I'm not with you right now.
I'm sorry. It's time.
Okay, Hevek, don't be bored. You will not be alone.
Feldfebelfury, during a recent examination, you had a bad quality exam.
It already threatens the brain.
And that means you're not mobilized either.
Looks good.
It's a joke.
The North has begun open military actions.
Ignoring such behavior would be a mistake,
forcing us to solve the issue of the long-established state borders again.
Therefore, our Fuhrer made a wise decision.
We will gather all our forces at the border of the northern mountain range of Brix
and clear the territory from the invaders.
Those of you who are the first to go on this campaign today
are the best of the best.
I'm sorry I'm giving you another difficult mission.
It's an honor for me.
I believe it will be proof that we have no doubt in you, no matter what.
I will try to justify trust, Mr. Fuhrer.
I will pray for your well-being, Colonel Mustante.
And you, Major Alex Louis Armstrong, please help him.
Yes, sir.
However, if our main forces are in the North, I am concerned about the defense of the Central.
Do not worry.
This is entrusted to Frank Archer.
Archer? Is he still alive?
Congratulations on a successful job, Fuhrer.
There is no legend in the North about the Philosopher's Stone.
Even if we push them to war, they will not be defeated.
I think we should not forget that the North is a place of great power.
And the North is a place of great power.
And the North is a place of great power.
And the North is a place of great power.
And the North is a place of great power.
There is no legend about the Philosopher's Stone.
Even if we push them to war,
it is unlikely that there will be someone who will take it for creation.
Very good.
This time we will take advantage of the perversities of war.
Everyone who approaches the Philosopher's Stone will die.
And the military is not an exception.
Then not only Mustang, but ...
Yes.
At the front, everyone who had at least some kind of relationship with Hughes' case will die.
It will make envy.
And I'm here.
Well, you have to wait for them in the North.
I heard that this guy came.
You are grumbling envy.
Get off, man.
You can not say that.
He is the same homunculus as you,
only he can grow old like a man.
My masterpiece.
Where is this guy?
Who are you talking about?
This guy.
Just as you created pride and greed, he created me.
So who played with us?
Gogenheim.
Light.
This guy was here?
Where is he?
You miss your father.
Where is he?
He died.
You're lying.
He can not die.
Because I will kill him.
I broke the connection between his mind, soul and body.
The same happens with those who die.
You're lying.
Why did not you tell me?
I ...
His sons are still alive.
I ...
Did you hear that they got the Philosopher's Stone?
They ...
Philosopher's Stone?
If you leave everything as it is,
then they will return everything.
I do not allow.
How unfair.
These children will return everything to themselves.
And you, who was supposed to be the most precious of his sons,
you will not get anything.
I want to see their faces when I pull from under their noses the Philosopher's Stone.
The faces of those who lost everything.
I went to Taker.
What Taker?
I thought he died in Leoric.
Wait.
Why did Taker call him?
What is not clear?
To finish off his useless chemistry.
That is, his daughter.
Taker studied a lot of the Philosopher's Stone while he was in the fifth laboratory.
If he knows everything,
then his brothers will learn how to use the Philosopher's Stone.
What are you thinking about, passion?
Anger.
I will have a request for you.
You're leaving?
Right.
After all, your brother is a real genius.
He immediately realized that he needed a chemical circle with seven corners.
Did you just repeat it?
Let's say otherwise.
I improved it.
However, it is undeniable that Edward brought me closer to the truth.
It should be that he knew that this way you can activate the Philosopher's Stone.
Ed.
He was worried about me.
For him, the priority is only the restoration of your body.
And all other possibilities of using the Philosopher's Stone seem more uninteresting to him.
Why?
Perhaps because ...
No.
You can come here.
Mr. Taker!
I want you to imagine that I am a human.
I want you to pay your price first.
With the help of such a huge Philosopher's Stone, I can easily live.
Wait! I'm not ...
Nina! Nina!
Soon!
Mr. Taker!
Al?
Al!
Here he comes.
You are holding on well, although you are being hunted.
I heard from my brother.
Who are you?
I am only me.
No.
Do not make unnecessary movements.
What are you hiding?
I told you I heard about you.
Nev?
Today I will definitely get it.
Sorry, but this is not for sale.
Stop!
Nev!
Do not even hope for mercy.
Okay.
Take them, at least a hand, at least a leg.
I have the best car armor mechanic.
She will make me new and stronger.
How is that?
I have one question for you.
You will take away my arm and leg, attach yourself, and what's next?
Will you become a human?
We can attach car armor to ourselves, use armor, it does not matter.
We will still remain humans, and you ...
Shut up!
Passion, what are you doing?
Kill him!
If we do not split with him, she will scold us!
Kill him, Passion!
You also want to become a human.
You need a philosophical stone.
And your younger brother is now explaining to Tucker how to use it.
But if you find out how ...
Passion, what are you talking about?
You will do it.
You will do it.
Passion!
What are you thinking about?
I said.
What nonsense!
Do you really think that I will make people out of you?
Why not?
If you make people out of us, no one will chase you anymore.
You will no longer have enemies.
Betrayer!
You are a traitor!
Did she not say that if we bring a philosophical stone, she will make us human?
I do not believe it.
She needs a philosophical stone just to prolong her life.
For this, endless wars.
I do not believe it.
She needs a philosophical stone just to prolong her life.
She will no longer make people out of us.
Well, I do not care.
I will become a human by my own power.
Everything she said.
You can not trust passion.
You only interfere with us.
You can not trust passion.
You only interfere with us.
You only interfere with us.
Let's go.
We have to hurry.
Lena aimed at your brother.
Do you know where Tucker is?
There is a plant nearby that he worked on before he became a state alchemist.
Wait! Wait! I didn't promise you anything.
Why?
That's what I should be asking. Why? Why?
You want to become a human? You're immortal, and you're not getting any older.
I don't know why, but it seems your life is boring.
You won't be able to name it, and despite that, why?
You're so mean.
If you're right, then why bring your brother back to his former self?
It's the same thing.
Hey! This is the man who commands you.
Maybe I know him?
Maybe. I'll become a human and I'll tell you for sure.
Don't forget! I still have something that deprives you of your power.
I won't forget. I won't be able to forget.
Nina, look at this.
What happened?
You did it! Alphonso, thank you! It's Nina!
Nina!
Now you understand what I'm saying!
Yes, Nina! Tell me, dad, Nina!
But what about my soul?
Congratulations, Shotaker.
It's a wonderful transmutation.
Everything is fine. I'm not interested in your soulless doll.
You can join someone else's soul, but only if you have a strong will.
It wasn't for you.
Welcome, Alphonso Elric.
We can no longer use the Philosopher's Stone that we've been waiting for.
Use it?
No!
No!
It's the Philosopher's Stone!
Stay! Stay! Stay!
Yes, I can't see you right now,
but I'll hide my sad feelings and become stronger.
I'll make sure of it.
If my tears are overflowing, I don't have to stop them now.
I won't forget the pain that turns into kindness.
I've been in such a hurry that I've broken everything.
I'll get back to you, so that you can walk like me.
For you.
Your weakness is right here.
