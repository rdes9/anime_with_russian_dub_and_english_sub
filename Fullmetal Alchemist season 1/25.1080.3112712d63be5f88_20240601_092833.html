        <pre>Episode 1
The bride baked an apple pie.
Would you like some?
Roy.
As you can see, it's what they call taboo.
I don't understand your alchemy.
But I know that the one who breaks the taboo, at least once.
Don't worry, I didn't do anything.
But you were going to try.
So many died. No, I killed them.
This is war.
You just didn't see the war.
Yes, that's right.
But if you had to kill the enemies at the front,
you would have to do the same as I did.
What if you became a state alchemist?
Do you hope to fix something by bringing back a few people to life?
I don't know.
So, is it easy to break the taboo after you've done some research?
Or did you want to die yourself?
It's much easier.
You know, I couldn't even try.
I was scared for my life.
That's natural.
That's the kind of person I ended up being.
All people are like that.
But even such a life of mine might serve the purpose of...
Miles, I've made up my mind.
Tell me everything, Roy.
Lieutenant Colonel!
Excuse me, Lieutenant Colonel!
Don't worry, I'll wait.
Fuhrer!
As I understand it, you were looking for traces of military officials in this case.
Yes.
Yes, that's right.
I took the case to the fifth laboratory
and came to the conclusion that probably Brigadier General Basque Gran,
together with the survivors and the Schwarzes,
conducted dangerous experiments there.
Are you dissatisfied with this?
No, I'm not satisfied.
What? A Philosopher's Stone?
That's right.
I suppose that the army conducted experiments on the creation of a Philosopher's Stone.
There was a place for breaking the law.
And not only Brigadier General Gran.
At least that's what the former head of Dr. Marco knew.
There is a possibility that they are the participants.
Major General, Brigadier General, Colonel, are they all?
Yes.
Over the past year, they all died or disappeared without a trace.
However, it is alarming that the fifth laboratory still worked.
In addition, a few days ago, someone paid the mercenaries and they attacked the camp of the survivors and the Schwarzes.
Do you think they are the customers of the army officials?
Do you want to say that at the moment there are forces in the army
that are making attempts to create a Philosopher's Stone?
If this goes out, the army will lose its authority.
Okay, I'm kidding.
Go on investigating.
In secret, illegal experiments are being carried out on people.
The murderers, called homunculi, destroy evidence.
I can't look through my fingers at such a lawlessness.
We have to uncover this burglary.
Thank you.
And Mr. Fuhrer.
Dr. Marco.
I would like to interrogate him again.
Juliette?
Then I ask you to return to the headquarters.
To tell the truth, no one except her knows where Marco is hiding.
This is a necessary precaution so that the information does not leak even if I am tortured.
I see. Then I ask you, Mrs. Douglas.
To uncover this burglary.
When a person wants to get something, he needs to sacrifice something.
Thus, if you want to get something, you must give something equal in return.
In alchemy, this is called the law of equal exchange.
At that time, we believed that this was the truth ruling the world.
The law of equal exchange.
The law of equal exchange.
The law of equal exchange.
The law of equal exchange.
The law of equal exchange.

Take Every Thing!
I don't want to get involved in any trouble, and I don't want to listen to it.
However, scientists who worked under the guidance of Dr. Marco should have remained.
If only we could find them.
I take it for myself.
Well, as for that...
It doesn't really matter to us anymore.
What are you talking about?
We are no longer going to connect with all sorts of dangerous things like the Philosopher's Stone and the Homunculus.
Perhaps a smarter way would be better.
Perhaps it would be better, but...
If all this is so simple, why waste so much energy?
There is one person who can know.
This is our teacher.
The teacher lives in the south, in a place called Doublis.
We are going there.
That's what I'm talking about, guys.
It's right next to it! With Doublis!
Huh? What's there?
The Earth is inhabited by mechanics, astro-weapons and rushwells!
I'd like to go there at least once!
Take me, take me, take me!
Go there alone!
Who's going to give me money for the road?
Why don't you swear?
Why not? You're on your way anyway.
What can I do with you?
Finally, they decided not to get involved in dangerous enterprises anymore.
Do you understand how hard it is for us to protect them?
Yes, yes.
If only it were true.
Huh?
All for the sake that we do not become the next victims.
That's what they are, boys.
You're not going to Doublis?
But we'll get there before Rushwell.
It's good that it is.
But why?
Aren't you going to find out what can be used instead of the Philosopher's Stone?
If we tell them everything, we're done for.
We're done for? What do you mean?
We didn't tell them that our brother became a state alchemist.
And if we tell them that we conducted human transmutation ...
I still want to live.
And I want to grow up, become an adult.
Besides, even without all that shook, I think the teachers do not ask about it.
And what are you going to do?
In the mountains in the south there is a large settlement of Ishvarts.
I suppose that Shram and the others were going there.
Are you following Shram?
They say that once a Philosopher's Stone was created in Ishvarts.
However, they did not study alchemy.
Therefore, we think that maybe there is some completely different way for his creation.
I'll take him by the gills and pull out this secret from him.
Okay, brother.
In fact, he is not such a bad person.
He kills living people with alchemy.
I will not ask him for this.
Hello.
Who are you?
You are not Ishvarts.
How can I not notice?
I forgot to introduce myself.
I am a state alchemist responsible for the destruction of this region.
You have a guest.
Teacher.
I'm so glad you're alive.
And you survived.
Where have you been all these years?
In the mountains in the south there are many of our people.
All of our people also intended to move there.
We were able to make this journey without getting caught in the eyes of the soldiers
to meet our comrades from the central.
And on the way to us came the rumors about you.
I found out that all these three years you have been killing state alchemists.
Alchemists who burned down our village.
I understand your hatred.
And the truth.
Ishvarts is not here.
What can you talk about here?
Aren't you supposed to be in the reservations?
But what are you doing?
Maybe you'll just take revenge on everyone?
Vengeance revives the escape of a new revenge.
As the wisdom of Ishvar says,
you can sleep suffering from pain.
But you can't sleep causing pain.
Yes.
The end
It's a hand.
It's the hand of your brother.
Why didn't you tell me that the Elric brothers were in the hospital?
I didn't say.
In any case, it was nonsense.
Nonsense?
It is much more important that your transfer to the central will be made as soon as possible.
Come on, get up quickly.
You will make our life easier, my friend.
And my wife.
Be careful with the phone.
Order a ticket for me.
For the train to the central?
Something is happening there.
Mustang is so worried about him.
This is not his concern at all.
And there is no need to know about any nonsense.
And then, most likely, our phone is being listened to.
Yes.
Sorry, I need to check something else.
Okay.
Be careful.
Dad has a lot of work.
I'm going.
Bring the materials to the office.
Yes.
Where is the drawing of the alchemical circle of the fifth laboratory?
The project for the first year of the uprising in Ishwar.
And how will I get paid?
Here are the photos, Lisi.
Ishwar, Lior, then the Ogwar mine.
The one who gets closer to the Philosopher's Stone will go.
It's all strange.
If they want to drive people to create the Philosopher's Stone,
why then spread the rumour that you will die if you get closer to it?
Just to get rid of all the evidence.
Yes.
Is it really the other way around?
And if everything is the other way around?
Okay, okay.
The reason for the uprising in Ishwar is...
military Douglas.
Where did I hear that?
I'm sorry.
It's a call from the Secretariat of the Fuhrer.
Yes.
Dr. Marko is in the headquarters now.
He's waiting in the hotel.
Thank you.
I'm leaving immediately.
Douglas.
Juliet.
Cheska!
Put all these materials in places.
What?
When you're done, you can go home.
And you're fired.
What?
Don't come here anymore!
I'm sorry you had to come here on purpose, Madam Secretary.
Douglas.
Were you in the war in Ishwar?
No.
I was working in the rear then.
Me too.
Lately, I've been finding out something.
Did you hear that the cause of the uprising was the murder of an Ishwar child
by one of the soldiers there?
And do you know the name of this soldier?
Juliet Douglas.
A common name.
It's even more interesting.
A soldier with such a name
seems to have died two years before the beginning of the uprising in Ishwar.
That's strange.
And here's another strange thing.
Douglas has been dead for two years.
But Juliet Douglas was not excluded from the army lists.
Moreover, during these two years,
a soldier with such a name was unexpectedly promoted.
And now she is the secretary of the Fuhrer.
Who are you?
Were you in Ishwar?
Or did you use Douglas's documents to enter the war?
The doctor is waiting for you.
What about Markley behind this door?
Nice to meet you.
Or better to say goodbye.
You have a cool tattoo, sister.
Who would have thought that he could do that?
Lazy.
Will you arrange it?
Ross!
The enemies are now near the Fuhrer.
They got lost in the army.
Their goal is not to create a philosophical stone.
Come with me.
Yes, sir.
Oh, damn it.
What? He's not here?
He went to the headquarters together with the lieutenant.
What? What happened?
With this information, it would be possible to rise up at once.
In any case, it's a safe place.
Right. I didn't lose my marks.
Come on, give me everything.
Your lieutenant is a motherland under your eyes.
Ross!
We are not separated.
Wow. Cool.
Well, sorry.
My wife and child are waiting for me at home.
It's an effective scene, lieutenant.
I will become a Fuhrer.
I will change the situation in our country.
This is my duty.
You need people who understand you and support you.
I will support you from below and push you up.
Mom, why?
Why are they burying Dad?
Uncle, why are you burying Dad?
Why?
Alicia.
No, no.
If they do this, if they do this, Dad will not be able to work anymore.
Mom, stop them.
Alicia.
Dad said he had a lot of work.
I don't like it.
I don't like it.
Don't bury his mom.
Dad!
Daddy!
He died during the execution and a double promotion in the rank.
So, Brigadier General Hughes.
He said he would support me from below, and he overtook him himself.
And what now?
Fool.
What a fool.
Colonel.
Once upon a time I tried to create the theory of human transmutation.
Now I'm trying to remember it with all my might.
What disgusting creatures, alchemists.
Why didn't he tell me that the Elric brothers were involved in this case?
There was no need to do everything alone.
Didn't you understand?
What exactly?
When it comes to these brothers, you, Colonel, lose the ability to make sober decisions.
That's why Brigadier General Hughes left all the information to take them with him.
So that you could calmly do your business.
It's raining.
Yes.
It's raining.
This is what you call a moustache of your mom.
Hughes and his wife and baby Alice are very good people.
Yes.
Lieutenant Colonel Hughes is a crazy daddy, and his moustache is not his business.
He always laughed at us.
He said he had a lot of work, and he himself came to our hospital every day.
Why did he care so much about us?
I know.
When you get back to the headquarters, thank him as you should.
Hey!
What's going on?
Nothing.

26th episode.
What's the reason?
I never thought someone would think that way about me.
