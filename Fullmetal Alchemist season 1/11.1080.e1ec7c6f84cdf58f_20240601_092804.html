        <pre>Episode 4
Could the Philosopher's Stone be in such a poor town?
It's hard to believe that this town flourished thanks to gold mining.
Maybe that's why the Philosopher's Stone is being researched here.
So?
Someone must have had an idea to artificially create gold where its mining in the mountains ended.
Once these places were famous for their gold searches.
Who would suspect that it's unnatural?
I really don't like some adults' ideas.
Eliza!
Hey, guys, help!
It's not working. It's not moving at all.
Everything will be fine. We will definitely get you out.
What happened?
I pressed down my daughter. I can't get her out.
Hold on a second.
When a person wants to get something, he needs to sacrifice something.
Thus, if you want to get something, you must replace something equal.
In alchemy, this is called the law of equal exchange.
At that time, we believed that this is the truth that rules the world.

Bersio!
It's not true!
Uncle Bersio is not bad.
I asked him to let me help.
I'm sorry, Eliza. Here, drink this.
I'm sorry.
Uncle Bersio said that Dad has the most delicious lemon pies.
It's a pity that there are so few gardens left around the city.
When they create the Philosopher's Stone, we will flourish again.
Then the fruit will be easy to buy anywhere.
The Philosopher's Stone?
Yes, yes.
You probably came to help in the research of Mr. Magvara.
Well, in the creation of the Philosopher's Stone.
Gentlemen alchemists, please, create the Philosopher's Stone as soon as possible.
Whatever it is, we want to restore the city of gold to Xenotime.
Gentlemen alchemists, please.
Well, maybe everything.
In any case, we will meet with this Mr. Magvara.
By the way, will you name your names?
Names? I'm Edward. Edward Elric.
And I'm his younger brother Alphonse. Alphonse Elric.
The Elric brothers? State alchemists?
Yes.
What are you doing?
Shut up! The real Elric brothers have been there for a long time.
Come when you decide to name your real names.
Alphonse Elric
Ah ... Who stole our names?
Ed, do you really want to get inside?
Of course!
Let's grab the
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
So, it's you?
The self-proclaimed have appeared!
So, you are the real Edward!
No, no!
The real Edward is me!
Me!
What?
Are you really the elder brother?
I don't care!
Don't get excited!
Or the guards will notice you!
So, the real younger brother is wearing armor?
Doesn't look like he's 14 years old at all.
Did you file a complaint against us?
Well, let's fight?
If you quietly leave, there is no reason to fight.
And we will soon use your names.
And that's how you ask people for loans?
Sit down!
Don't you dare look up and down!
So, that's what worries you.
You are already 15 years old, and your height is just...
So, the self-proclaimed have appeared!
It seems that the real Edward had to suffer.
It seems that your life wasn't very fun either.
Get him!
I would like to see what a state alchemist is capable of.
How can you not regret it?
Not bad, without an alchemical circle!
He also goes around without a circle!
Do you have a silo stone?
A stone?
What's that noise?
Come here!
Damn it! It hurts!
And this self-proclaimed is strong.
He uses stones.
So, it seems that the philosophical stone has already been created?
We will definitely find out.
I wonder what the names of these brothers are.
They must have real names.
Should the older brother be older than you?
What do you think?
Don't judge by your height!
Listen, let's stop.
What will happen if these two tell the truth to everyone?
Don't worry.
No one will believe in their tales.
And we will quickly complete the creation of the philosophical stone and leave the city.
And we will succeed?
We will not allow Magwar to assign himself an opening over which our father worked all his life.
But...
Don't worry.
In the extreme case, I will do everything to save you.
But how do you not understand?
It will not please me.
What are you cooling here?
Did you want to visit?
It seems that there were strangers here.
Don't worry.
The Elric brothers got rid of them.
True.
Maybe these kids are also cheaters?
What?
The military will soon find out about these researches.
This is a matter of time.
I will have to get rid of you from this case.
Magwar.
Please, don't.
I ask you to be patient a little more.
I will definitely create the philosophical stone.
Be patient.
Now all the means are good.
It's so fluffy.
Oh, it's so cool.
I'm glad you found this body, Ed.
Did we see you in the evening in the store?
If you have nowhere to stay, come to me.
I'm sorry to bother you.
Did you help us so much?
I can't afford to let the children sleep on the street.
Why don't you ask what our name is?
You seem to be the Elric brothers.
Do you believe us?
No.
But you may have your own reasons for cheating.
It's not for me to take responsibility.
It's for you.
It seems that you are not interested in the philosophical stone.
Local residents cannot forget the wealth that brought them the gold.
This gives Magwar power.
Good morning, Uncle Bersio.
Dad will scold you again for coming to me.
Come on.
Dad only thinks about gold mines now.
He won't notice.
Good morning.
Where have you been?
What is it?
You must have been beaten for lying, right?
We are not lying here.
They beat me.
Nobody believes us.
Did you sneak into the mansion yesterday?
Of course.
We need to get the self-proclaimed people to clean water.
It's not good to make gold with the help of a philosophical stone.
Ed.
I'll go and see the city.
Hey, fatso.
Yes?
Tell me.
Do you believe me?
Hey, fatso.
Yes?
Tell me.
Will you go to the pharmacy?
Okay.
I'll ask you to take the medicine for Eliza.
And my brother probably needs a compress.
He is in armor.
This is the self-proclaimed man.
What a horror.
He should have left.
Maybe they tried to rob the mansion of Mr. Magvara yesterday.
Hey, you.
Why did you come?
I'm a medicine.
We don't have medicine for liars.
Get out of here.
That's the problem.
I can't buy medicine now.
Excuse me.
You?
I'll buy you medicine.
Medicine?
Huh?
Equal exchange.
Apology for a lie.
Here you are.
Thank you very much.
You and I suffer from the fact that our brothers are so crazy.
Don't be angry.
You probably have such circumstances.
I'm sorry.
To participate in the investigation of Mr. Magvara, we needed known names.
And if the state alchemists are still children, then it can only be the Elric brothers.
Do you really need a philosophical stone?
Our father studied it all his life.
So your father was an alchemist too?
Yes.
But one day he disappeared.
So my brother decided that he was obliged to take up this case after my father.
And we have the opposite.
My brother hates his father, who was an alchemist.
Because my father was only engaged in his research, not thinking about our mother.
We have seen many who suffered from alchemy.
If your brother makes a mistake, only you can stop him.
If others do it, it will only make your brother worse.
I am always tormented by one question.
Why are there so many coughs in this city?
Did you notice?
Well, yes.
Did you also buy cough medicine?
Well, in general ...
This is my brother.
I'm sorry, I have to go.
Hey, what's your name?
Fletcher.
Ed, what happened?
There was this self-proclaimed elder brother.
Have you seen him?
Yes.
He was very kind.
He repaired the wheels of the local car.
Everything is better than doing something bad.
I don't like what he's doing, ignoring the law of equal exchange.
Al, tonight we'll go there again.
What? Despite what happened yesterday?
Exactly because of what happened yesterday.
Listen, we need to talk.
What?
Today we use the tactic of the mole.
Mole?
Yes.
We will go under the foundation of the building.
Do you think?
Well, or somewhere else.
We have reached.
What is it?
Perhaps, from this water they create red stones.
Red stones?
I read about it in one book in the library of the Central.
According to the chemical composition, it is almost identical to the philosophical stone.
It is created by cleaning the red water.
That is, the stone created from this water is philosophical?
But they are not quite identical.
I heard that the study of this substance was engaged in some kind of mnezh.
But nothing came out of it.
Ed?
Something is following me.
Ed?
Ed!
Come here!
Who is here?
It's me.
Faster!
Hurry up!
Fletcher?
Ed, are you okay?
Where are we?
What are you doing here?
I'm sorry.
What is it?
Why are you crying?
Fletcher, if you know something, tell me.
You don't like doing it yourself, do you?
This is red water.
It is very, very dangerous for people.
But it is necessary to create a red stone.
It turns out that the citizens cough because of this?
Forgive me, please.
Damn it!
I have to stop it.
I won't let you do that.
Finally, we managed to grow a large red stone.
My father sacrificed himself for this.
If you don't complete the experiment, then his sacrifice was in vain.
Well, what can your praised stone do?
I'm sure this sword is fake.
Now I will kill it together with the stone.
Because it's mine, real one.
Stop!
Red water.
You will be covered.
After that, you will not get away.
Come on, try it.
Don't do stupid things.
Exactly.
Your brother says so.
Go away.
Never.
I will not give way to a guy who is too much in the shadow of daddy.
Fletcher.
Fletcher, hold on.
You know, because my father studied this red water to make people happy.
And because of what we do, people in the city only suffer.
After all, you have to make people happy.
You have to make people happy.
People in the city only suffer.
After all, you have to understand it, brother.
Doesn't it matter who gets glory?
Our father...
Our father would be unhappy.
The sea is painful, but...
Old alchemist.
