        <pre>Yes, so you are a messenger of God.
So they went down to his loyal servant Karu.
To me, the alchemist...
Strong hand!
Alex L.V. Armstrong!
Well, look!
This is the technique of the true art of alchemy,
which from generation to generation was passed on to the Armstrong family!
Well done!
Turn the country of destruction and destruction!
Turn the country of destruction and destruction!
Destroying the flag again is the law of the universe!
I will talk to you as soon as I kill the head of the crystal.
The combination of physical strength and alchemy will have to be combined.
Brown skin and red eyes!
Wait!
Didn't the God of your people impose a strict prohibition on the use of alchemy?
If the process of alchemical transformation can be divided into analysis,
analysis of decomposition and restructuring,
then you stop the alchemical reaction at the second step of decomposition.
But still, this is alchemy!
I only do what this hand commands me to do.
Even if it goes against the will of God!
When a person wants to get something, he needs to sacrifice something.
In this way, if you want to get something, you have to replace it with something equal.
In alchemy, this is called the law of equal exchange.
At that time, we believed that this was the truth that ruled the world.
But now we have to change the law of alchemy.

Alchemy!
Ed, what are we going to do now?
First of all, let's get rid of the guy in the dark glasses.
Mr. Marco!
Excuse me, where is the black hole?
Aren't we going back to the eastern headquarters?
General Gran appeared here.
Probably, in this situation, the colonel will not be able to protect Mr. Marco.
Well, yes. There are a lot of people from the headquarters here now.
Huh? Someone from the headquarters is here?
They accompany the Fuhrer.
Are you going to kidnap me?
No, no, what are you?
Wait, wait!
I told you!
Enough.
I don't care if he kills me.
He has the right to do so.
He has the right to do so.
Colonel, we found him!
Major, do you hear what happened here?
I almost fell.
Colonel, what about Brigadier General Gran?
If he survived after that, I would believe that the alchemist of iron blood can come back to life after passing through the meat grinder.
He was the best expert in hand-to-hand combat.
This is a scar, no doubt.
He... he is an alchemist.
Major, don't get up!
I ask you to forgive me for not following the order, Colonel.
I saw his skin and eyes.
He is an alchemist, no doubt.
That's why he hunts for state alchemists.
Why? If he is an alchemist, he has the right to kill you.
And the alchemists themselves started that war for independence.
Many of them died, but there were also many casualties among the military.
If everyone who lost the war decides to take revenge, then there will be no end to the deaths.
It wasn't a war. It was a cut.
The Ishvars are people from the East.
Their God is the Creator of everything, the One God Ishvara.
They have a great religious worldview.
We think that the structure of the world can be explained mathematically.
We pay great attention to alchemy because of its equal exchange.
And the Ishvars consider alchemy to be the devil's occupation, which changes the world given to them by God.
For this reason, there were separate speeches from time to time.
However, 13 years ago...
What have you done?
During the inspection, one officer accidentally shot a child.
This incident has grown into a large-scale massacre.
The war quickly spread throughout the Eastern region and lasted for seven years.
At the very end of the war,
the Supreme Command decided to send state alchemists to the front.
Why? Because of their religion, the Ishvars have no alchemy or modern weapons.
Why cause them even more suffering?
And he brought it.
It is still in the stage of refurbishment.
And the reason to use it?
The uprising is still growing.
If you try to suppress it, it will only increase the number of allies of our enemies.
Do you want to say that the Fuhrer is wrong?
The number of casualties among the military is already at 1000,
and the losses among the civilian population are tens of thousands.
This is war.
Show me the crystal alchemist.
In order to end the war in Kroche,
I allow the use of alchemical power from tomorrow.
And what happened next?
Nothing.
Nothing?
The wars on all fronts where state alchemists were sent ended in one night.
And what happened next?
Nothing.
And what happened next?
Nothing.
And what happened next?
Nothing.
And what happened next?
Nothing.

Nothing.
And what happened next?
Nothing.
Come here!
War!
War!
Show it to me.
I met a couple on the front line.
They were all doctors,
whether allies or enemies.
So?
Thank you.
Thank you.
Great, huh?
They were killed for that.
Colonel Grant, what is this?
This was the center of communication of the remaining seven living koshmarts.
The doctors were with them because of one thing.
They just fought for every life.
Yes, and this life saved then killed my subordinates.
Stop!
I was just following orders.
It's all my fault.
They were also doctors like me and saved lives.
And I...
What should I do now?
Shut up and let me escape.
I took with me the Philosopher's Stone
and all the materials related to it.
But it was too late.
The people of Shvar are dead.
I heard that not many are left alive.
But I don't understand
why he wants to kill you.
He has a legal reason for revenge.
Is there some kind of law
for people who are not involved in revenge?
He just covers his unfulfilled desire
to avenge himself by calling himself the messenger of God.
If this happened to you, brother,
I would do the same.
This is another manifestation of the law of equal exchange.
No.
Revenge can't bring anything back.
You just have to live.
Live, live and be happy.
Give it to me.
Give it to me.
Mr. Marko,
maybe you can hide in my hometown
and get on the train in three days, okay?
You can't go back there.
There's a house of Rock-Bel's engineers and mechanics.
You might find a place there.
Rock-Bel?
I can't go there.
Mr. Mark!
You fools!
You rely on weapons developed with the help of your damned alchemy?
Out of the way!
Colonel Mustang!
Mustang?
A state alchemist!
Exactly!
Colonel!
A fire alchemist!
Roy Mustang!
Another one who turned from God's path!
You will fight even knowing that you are a fire alchemist!
Colonel!
Colonel!
Halt!
What are you doing?
On a rainy day, there are not many of you, so stay behind!
If he got wet, he wouldn't be able to get out of the water.
Fire!
And speed!
Follow him.
Junior Lieutenant Brad, wait for the other alchemist at the station.
Why is he at the station?
I'm sure he decided to help Marco escape.
Wait, Mr. Marco, we are not taking away the power of your research.
No, I can't go. No.
This time, I know that this is an empty armor.
By connecting both hands, you make a circle.
By using the circulating force, you create an alchemical reaction.
Without your right hand, you can't do anything.
And I will destroy it!
Brother!
Brother Ed, run!
Brother Ed!
Brother Ed!
Brother Ed!
It's time for you to pray to God.
Unfortunately, I stopped believing in God.
You said that your elder brother died in a fire.
He was killed by a state alchemist.
I am also an elder brother.
Kill me, and it will be an equal exchange.
What are you saying, Ed?
You yourself explained to me that this is an unequal exchange.
He is not a state alchemist.
You have enough of me.
I give the word that I don't touch my younger brother.
But you are mistaken, steel alchemist.
More than the loss of my elder brother and my people,
an equal exchange cannot help.
Then why is your revenge?
Why?
Ed, what are you doing?
Run!
Sanya, run!
Run!
No! No!
Stop!
Mr. Markov!
Why did you come back, doctor?
Who?
You heard, I was looking at the old records.
And there I saw symbols of a similar drawing on your hand.
This is not a perfect thing, but still this is a philosophical stone.
So this is a hand.
Shut up, finally!
What's going on?
Markov does not use the power of the stone.
No!
Underground aqueduct?
Do not pursue.
Hello!
Finished?
If you were here, you could help us.
Do not entangle ordinary people like me in your show of people with strangeness.
Lieutenant Hawkeye, close the passage.
Do not let anyone in.
Yes!
Al, are you okay?
I hate you!
For what?
Why did you not leave me and did not run away?
So you would have been killed.
So what? This is not a reason to choose death, fool!
You call your older brother a fool?
And I repeat this as much as you want!
Live, live, continue to live!
Study alchemy and someday return our real bodies!
To die?
To die alone?
I will not let you!
Here! My hand broke off!
Fool!
Yes, it was good that we were crushed.
That's what it means not pulled.
But we are alive.
Yes, we are alive.
These armor never heard about transmutation of the soul.
He tried to conduct transmutation at any cost.
Therefore, the connection between the brothers is very strong.
I remember.
The secretary of the Fuhrer.
The secretary of the Fuhrer?
The service of the Fuhrer takes Mark under his control.
He will not be harmed.
That's how?
I understand.
Mr. Marko?
I said this.
I can not go to your city.
Why?
Those two doctors who died in the war.
I was a doctor.
Let's go.
Brother, you just heard my voice.
Fool!
You were on the verge of death.
You will die.
Steel Alchemist.
16th series.
Lost.
You will die.
You will die.
You will die.
You will die.
You will die.
You will die.
You will die.
You will die.
You will die.
You will die.
You will die.
16th series.
Lost.
Brother's hand and foot.
My body.
Having lost them, did we get anything in return?
