How much longer are we going to stay here? And what about the border?
Who knows?
Many soldiers doubt the success of the operation and may violate the order.
Using the tactics of point raids, we will reduce the number of victims to a minimum.
Look at him!
We are now returning to the central.
Our task is to take over the central headquarters.
But this is a ruckus!
The uprising against the Fuhrer himself!
Fuhrer leads our country on the wrong path.
We also have to take control of the government building, understand?
But you don't have any evidence.
Evidence? If you need evidence, here they are.
There is not a single sign of imperfection on this charred body.
Here is evidence that I am right.
Look at it more carefully.
Touch it and stand.
Philosophical stone.
Those who have acquired it do not depend on the law of equal exchange.
And in order to get something, they should not give equal exchange anymore.
We were looking for it and got it.
The only thing I want to spit out is the proof of existence.
The future that I should have grasped is full of dignity and freedom.
The only thing I want to erase is my distorted image.
Because I see my own limits there.
In my self-righteous, emotional window,
I can't find the calendar of the future.
Erase it!
Relight it!
This stupid illusion!
The forgotten existence!
Extinguish it!
Relight it!
Even your meaningless imagination!
I will destroy you!
Give me the whole world!
I will destroy you!
Mom!
I turned all the molecules of water into ethanol.
It will disappear soon.
You did a good job.
Don't forget to clean it up later.
Mom!
Mom!
This is...
What's going on?
Something happened in the village?
I was just worried about you.
You defeated her.
No, you're not Winry.
I'll tell you the truth, I'll...
That's it.
It's useless. I've become a Philosopher's Stone.
What are you saying?
Then let's try it.
I wonder if you'll be able to stand it if I become a Philosopher's Stone...
No! Don't touch Alla!
Don't worry about it. I'll just take him to that man.
That man?
The man I was talking about. He's in charge of you.
I heard that he was looking for the Philosopher's Stone to obtain immortality.
Yes. You're more likely to have met him before.
Maybe the one who stands above you?
He took our mom with him.
And he could have done it.
It can't be! Father couldn't have done it!
Well, let's go.
Hey, hey! You chose the wrong one. You have to stop him.
He can do anything.
You shouldn't touch him.
If we use him, we can bring mom back.
Isn't that right?
You got me!
It's your fault.
My mom died because of you.
Mom! Mom! Mom!
She died!
She was also your mom!
Stop!
It's none of your business.
You have to want to kill me.
You're not my mom!
I don't know you at all!
Teacher!
Ouch!
How are you?
He was crying.
And I couldn't stop crying.
He was crying because of me too.
That's enough. Stop worrying.
We have to save Alla.
Maybe I'll be useful too.
That's why I'm here.
Brother, if we don't leave now...
Wait, wait! What does Central mean?
There are books I've never seen.
Wow! And there's even this one!
I wish I could see Ada and Alla.
Isn't that enough?
That's a problem. If I buy them, how am I going to pay for tonight?
But if I don't get them now, then when?
On credit?
Impossible. This is a specialized store.
We serve state alchemists.
Even if you read this, you won't understand.
Then I'll take on credit as a state alchemist.
I'm tired of being incognito.
Brother!
Is that Edward Elric?
Yes. He definitely called himself a state alchemist.
Wait, that was just a joke.
In fact, I'm not...
Explain yourself. You'll be in the headquarters.
We have an order to arrest as soon as we find him.
Brother, that's...
Don't come near, Fletcher!
Younger brother! Younger Elric is here!
Wait, damn it, don't resist!
Brother!
Was the younger one less?
Probably.
What have you done, brother?
The headquarters is a terrible place.
Passion.
They destroyed the homunculus.
I didn't do it.
Probably.
In any case, now there are only four left.
The child, the type who devours everything in a row,
the one who can turn around, and the Fuhrer.
And the one who stands above them.
Who are you?
Nina, say hello to them.
What happened?
You were embarrassed, that's how...
After all, the soul has not returned.
Nina, let's play.
Where is Alexander? Where is Alexander?
What are you going to do with him, Nina?
Everything is fine.
A soulless doll.
Such a form took his sin.
And he will live with it.
Maybe this is for the best.
You have grown up.
Grown up?
When I decided to become a state alchemist,
I thought I had already grown up.
Well, what are we going to do?
I now know the location of only one of the remaining homunculus.
So our goal is the Fuhrer, King Bradley.
What are you waiting for? Run!
We are completely surrounded.
And not so many soldiers will follow us.
What are you going to do here?
The power of the Fuhrer is absolute.
Few of the officers.
Decide to go against?
The plan of the new brigade general looks like a joke.
I don't think so.
The plan of the new brigade general looks like a failure.
No, according to the plan of Mr. Mustang,
we should have won time here
and lure the forces from the central.
It remains a little patience.
My colonel, how can it be?
I'm not a brigade general Mustang,
but I'm doing such a crazy thing.
Hold on, guys, I'm with you.
Besides, you two look good together.
No!
No!
Young Lieutenant Hewok!
You will be silent.
Yes.
Probably this is some important task.
Oh!
Secret mission.
Not to be disclosed.
Sorry.
Nothing.
Why are you angry?
I'm not angry at all.
Hewok and the others have succeeded.
Yes.
Faster, faster, faster!
This night the whole army should catch up
with the brigade general Mustang.
Great! You were able to quickly transfer the troops.
All this is thanks to your orders, Mr. Fuhrer.
It is incredible how you could foresee this situation.
If we had given Mustang and Armstrong enough people,
they would have raised the bar.
They turned out to be as unreliable as Basque Gran.
I had to raise the Mustang in the rank of brigade general
to show that I trust him.
Perhaps you were all dissatisfied with this.
Not at all.
In one or two days we will crush them.
Can I come back today?
What?
Those who were arrested this morning
call themselves the Elric brothers?
Well, well.
You will destroy them.
Why did you call Edward Elric?
What did I have left?
Money!
And my father's diary.
I had to give it to him.
And I had to give it to Edward Elric.
And I had to give it to Edward Elric.
To give it to him?
I had to give it to Edward Elric.
Hide it
Thank you for your help.
I'll do the job in turn.
In fact, everything is the same as on the drawings?
Yes, I work without errors.
However, the design is strange.
Usually the wine is buried...
I don't really understand either.
The secretary of the Führer gave such instructions.
She is on vacation now, so I'm instead of her.
Since we order changes so urgently,
there is a little more here.
Oh, that's how it is.
After all, the headquarters pays generously.
The construction is going according to plan.
It seems that we only have one day.
Well, what's there?
Rumors that this morning the Elric brothers were arrested.
The Führer
I could have checked in advance if there is a Führer here or not.
And now what?
How do I know that his son is on his birthday and he left earlier?
They are here!
Stop arguing!
I didn't know!
Damn! Where are they?
Are you all right?
Is that you?
Self-proclaimed?
I'm Russell Trinkham!
They were arrested because of you.
And as soon as we confused them,
we are as different in height as they are.
What did you say?
Oh, what are you, even more?
Everything, everything! I was wrong!
Shut up!
The Führer unexpectedly gave an order to liquidate them.
We came here to find out what was going on.
And when we set up a trap here,
they were able to run away.
They were here!
Find them immediately!
It's a pity. We just met, and we have to go.
Where are you going?
I suppose home, to the Führer.
There is nowhere else.
Here.
This is a part of my father's diary.
Here are the records of how he was in the headquarters.
Ah!
Teacher!
This is...
What?
But you are...
Frank...
Arthur...
Edward Taurik...
and the woman who ran away from the Southern HQ.
I'll take care of it.
And you go to the address from the diary.
Teacher!
I will do as the teacher says. Go!
And you too! Quickly!
Go!
Apparently, they don't need your help, Colonel.
They made it.
It's clear that they were caught by accident.
Now it's obvious.
Let's go.
Excuse me, I need a car.
Steel?
What?
Colonel?
Are you catching me too?
Where are you going now, Colonel?
Vak district.
The Führer's house is located there.
What are you doing to the Führer?
It's clear already.
But there are so many guards there.
Major Armstrong is raising an uprising now.
It's unlikely that someone thinks that I'm hiding in the headquarters.
Didn't you want to make a career and become a Führer?
You also became an army dog trying to achieve your goal, however...
Wait.
Yes, to overcome all the bad things and achieve your goal.
I thought it would be right.
You can't afford to fight the Führer now.
Even if you defeat him, you won't be able to climb up again.
People won't accept it.
Let it be so.
But I won't forgive this man.
A revenge for Colonel Hughes?
Yes.
He must have known everything that happened in the army.
And for that you will give up everything you have achieved?
I don't feel sorry for that.
But you also gave up your job as an army dog for the sake of your brother...
and spat out all the evil that you swallowed as an adult.
And you and I are like children trying to live without betraying our dreams.
Are you coming with me?
Before I joined the army, the war was far away for me.
It started and ended somewhere where I had never been.
I thought it had nothing to do with us.
However, there is someone who, for the sake of making the Philosopher's Stone,
makes wars.
Therefore, as long as those who need the Philosopher's Stone are alive,
the wars will continue.
The homunculus is set on fire by the warriors,
but they themselves are born only from the transmutation of man.
This is no more than the creation of our hearts and minds.
Therefore, there are no wars that we have nothing to do with.
No.
You have put too much weight on yourself.
We can only influence what is happening next to us.
Find the type that is called the man and kill him.
Then destroy the Philosopher's Stone,
so that no one will ever remember it again,
so that it disappears from memory.
Destroy it?
The Philosopher's Stone?
After all, they created it.
However, maybe ...
It was not they who created the Philosopher's Stone,
but our hearts.
But it was a dream,
to return the lost with the help of the Philosopher's Stone.
Is it possible that only our dreams come true?
Is there anything more important than a dream?
There is always.
More important than yourself, more important than a dream,
more important than everything.
Farewell.
Farewell.
To be continued...
To be continued...
To be continued...
To be continued...
