Most likely, among the recruits of the 104th Cadet Corps, there are no giants.
The group of giants is moving south.
In the Rose Wall, a barbed wire is pierced.
The 104th Cadet Corps was isolated by suspicion that there were giants among them.
But because of the sudden appearance of giants, they were sent to inform the neighborhood about the danger.
As you understand, today is yet another gloomy day in the history of mankind.
So when can we surpass mankind if not right now?
However...
Why did they suddenly run away?
So far, no one has figured out the real reason for what happened.
You must recognize the interesting device you came up with.
Stop! No!

Commander Pixis!
Giants have appeared!
In the Rose wall!
The bridge is broken!
What the hell does all this mean?
What would they...
But...
Would the Titans break walls of their own kind?
This has already happened, have you forgotten?
They broke the wall into our city.
There were gates.
Armin, what do you want to say?
You know, at the walls...
There are no seams between the stones,
and there are not even a single crack on them.
The technology of their construction is a mystery to us.
But what if they are all made of reinforced skin of giants?
If Eni couldn't get in the way,
then the reinforcement is capable of a lot.
Walls...
Of the Titans?
Capral!
What are you doing?
We're leaving in five minutes!
Hurry up!
I need to make sure of something.
Hey!
What are you doing?
Hey!
Move!
Oh, sorry.
How is he?
He's ready and waiting.
Armin,
get dressed as you should.
It's cold at night.
And here we are.
It took more time to prepare than we thought.
Oh,
is that the pastor of the wall sect?
Oh,
Nick and I are best friends now,
aren't we?
Don't pay attention.
Anyway, the composition of this detachment
doesn't make any sense.
Right, Levi?
No,
not quite.
I've got Armin on purpose.
Open the gates!
The situation on the inside of Rose
is unknown.
Everything is clear to Armin
and we'll win time
with this route.
Follow me!
Yes, sir!
Move!
Yes, sir!
All this time
some giants
were protecting us
from the others.
Did he know?
There are titans in the walls
and he knew about them all this time?
Yes,
he still keeps his mouth shut.
And now
we'll take him to see
the cruel reality.
Will he be able to stick to his faith
and keep silence?
Or will he start doubting it
seeing everything with his own eyes?
No, no, no, no!
Not like that!
If you know something,
tell us about it!
Nothing is more important
than your death!
Eren!
Sit down, calm down!
It's all the consequences of the transformation.
There are many ways
to untie the tongue.
Maybe I'm wounded and useless in battle
but it's a great task
to keep one person on his ear.
I hope that no one
will have to make extra holes.
What about you?
Levi, he's not afraid of the threat.
He checked it himself.
Nevertheless, it seems to me
that the pastor is capable of good judgment.
And that's what comes to mind.
It seems that there is a possibility
that his silence
is more important
than the fate of a pitiful person.
Do you see?
It's a village!
Is it the last one?
No, it's my town.
It's deep in the forest.
I'll go there alone.
Okay.
Then I'll take this village for myself.
Yes!
Hey! Stop it, Sasha!
Sasha!
Are you carrying our supplies again?
Give it back!
Don't you dare eat it!
We smoked this meat for the winter, you fool!
You're such a fool!
All right,
let's eat it all!
Damn you!
Sasha,
have you ever asked
why this world is changing?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Why is this world changing?
Why is it more difficult
to find forests and wild animals
in recent years?
Have you ever thought about it?
It's all because
the foreigners come here,
cut off our forests and slaughter the wild animals.
That's why I want to eat them.
Yes, you're right.
But you know,
they came here
because they had no choice.
After all, they lost their homes.
It's all their fault.
Why did they forget about us?
They ran away from the giants.
The coast was made in the wall of the sea.
Where else can they go?
If you cut down the forest
and sow the grain,
you can feed much more people
than with hunting.
Who knows, maybe it's time for our clan
to leave the forest and stop hunting.
The government
promised to pay for each horse
that we can raise.
What? What else?
If we stop hunting,
we will stop being ourselves.
Why should we sacrifice something
for those who ridicule our lifestyle?
See?
It's all because
we live in one world.
We are people.
We have always lived in flocks.
Well, yes,
somehow everyone lives their own way,
but in a limited space
you have to unite
and think about the common cause.
No, not at all!
We have lived here all our lives,
just as our ancestors promised us.
We owe nothing to these strangers.
That's how it is.
That's how it is.
You can continue living here
in the forest
with your people.
But here's the thing, Sasha.
Are you ready to die
for this choice?
No matter how bad you are,
no one will ask you for help.
If you are not ready
to help society,
then society will not be able
to help you.
I am ready to abandon
our traditions
if I can live with my clan.
Everything in this world is interconnected.
Do you want it or not?
Sasha,
are you really so afraid?
Is it really so difficult
for you to get out of the forest
and make contact
with other people?
I haven't been here for three years.
I'm sure they felt
something wrong and saved themselves.
It can't be!
Have they made it?
How did they get so far?
Now here
you can't live with people anymore.
What is it?
A new village?
Sasha!
Sasha!
Sasha!
Sasha!
Sasha!
Sasha!
Sasha!
Sasha!
Sasha!
Sasha!
Sasha!
Sasha!
Sasha!
Sasha!
Sasha!
Sasha!
Sasha!
Sasha!
A little later...
Shit! If I don't get a knife, make use of it!
Aah!
A child?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
What's your name?
Everything's going to be okay. Don't be afraid.
What's going to happen?
What's going to happen?
Quiet!
Calm down!
Listen!
What's going to happen?
Wait for us!
Please, don't worry.
Wait a little bit. She'll be back in a minute.
Why are you so polite?
What's going to happen?
Let's get out of here!
Everything's going to be okay!
Why?
Everyone else left.
Everyone in the village knew
that mom had a bad leg.
But no one came to help.
All that was left was to watch.
Let's go!
Everything's going to be okay!
Okay!
You're starting to piss me off.
What?
This is your stupid politeness
when you're talking.
Why are you talking like that?
Even with cadets?
You see...
I'm kind of...
Wait, let me guess.
Are you shy of your dialect?
Are you shy?
I'm surprised that a fool like you
is so worried about it.
You've seen nothing in this life
but hunting.
And you've become a soldier
for some stupid reason.
Don't be afraid of your ancestors!
Stop it!
You, Sasha!
You're always going to hide behind this mask
because you're afraid of what others will say.
This is the last stupidity.
It's you!
So speak your language!
Thank you...
very much.
What?
I'm sorry, I...
I haven't...
Enough!
Don't change the style of your speech
just because they said so!
Sasha can figure it out on her own.
How and with who to talk to.
I like her like that.
Well, you know...
Although, when she starts talking normally
she won't piss me off less.
You know what?
Everyone around her is the same fat-skinned as you.
What? I'm sorry?
Oh, you...
little...
Hey!
What are you laughing at?
Oh, I'm sorry!
And why did I remember
these stupid, carefree days
just now?
And nothing else
to think about.
Hey, listen to me.
Everything will be fine.
Run along the road.
Just don't stop.
You will definitely meet
people who will help you.
Maybe not at once.
Don't give up.
Run until you see them.
Come on, run!
Run!
Move!
Move!
If I stab both eyes
I will win a little more time.
There are two arrows left.
Easy.
It's just a big
slow
wild one.
I got it!
The last arrow.
If
I can't hit it
I won't be saved.
I won't get hit.
And this...
This is a girl!
I escaped
thanks to the blood.
Now I have to catch up with her.
Sasha!
We were driving
around the area
and gave horses.
The girl told us
that someone else was left here.
I didn't think
that it was you.
You fought with the giant
to save this child.
Sasha,
I'm proud of you.
Dad!
I'm home.
Stop, horses!
Calm down!
Giants can be anywhere!
Slow down, horses!
How come?
Anyone?
Is there anyone?
It's me!
Horses!
I'm back!
Let's go!
Dad!
Mom!
Sasha!
Martin!
Mom!
Horses!
Back!
This is my home.
My...
Horses!
Back!
Back!
Wait!
Can't move?
The limbs seem to be dead.
Then...
How did he get there?
The video is for free
home viewing.
To be continued...
To be continued...
To be continued...
I'm sure the family is fine.
I'm sure the family is fine.
After fighting the horror of the invasion of the giants
to their native village,
the horse leaves his home again.
Fights are taking place everywhere.
The secret of the giants is still not revealed.
And while the situation is getting worse,
Eren and the others on the way to the army
receive a lead leading to the truth.
Next time...
Next time...
Next time...
Next time...
Next time...
