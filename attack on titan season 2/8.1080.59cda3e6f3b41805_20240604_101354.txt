Hey! Hey-hey-hey-hey!
Watch out from above!
Reiner!
What?
Eren!

Episode 33. In pursuit.
Commander!
Commander Pixis!
Wake up!
You'll catch a cold if you sleep here!
And when did you manage to drink all this?
You're not young anymore.
And I definitely don't want to change your
...
Commander Pixis!
Puppy!
I heard you managed to catch one of the rats.
Yeah, unfortunately, we're still one step behind.
But these guys in the center are at least moving around about the news.
Or they're thinking about how important their stubborn beliefs and beliefs are to them.
Yeah, it looks like it.
Look there.
The military police have finally been transferred to a region where there's a threat of giants.
I can't believe it. They didn't see a single giant.
Really? Not a single one?
It looks like it. It's unusually quiet there.
I wonder if they're alive.
No, can you believe it? I thought everything was bad here.
But in the end, everyone's just chilling.
Hey, Levi, where have you been hiding all this crap?
Oh, I see you're disappointed in that.
Oh, sorry.
Something didn't work out with the giants today.
But since you're trying so hard to test yourself,
we can organize an exit behind the walls.
What about uniting forces and going to cut down a couple of them?
Well, you know, we've got enough work to do inside the walls.
The front line's back!
Report to Pixis!
So, it looks like the walls are in perfect order.
That's right.
What did I think?
However, something did go wrong.
We ran back to the cable with the report
and met with a squad of scouts under the command of Caprolo Hanji.
They were recruited from the 104th Cadet Corps,
equipped with rifles.
And as it turned out, three of them...
were giants!
What?
What are you talking about?
There were giants among them?
You mean three more?
Who are they?
Well...
What about Jean and his son?
What happened when they were discovered?
The scouts went into battle with the titans and the armored giants.
But by the time we could get to them,
it was over.
I can't believe it.
What a defeat.
Luckily, we were up there and didn't get hurt.
All of them were torn to pieces by the squad.
They couldn't do anything.
How's Mikasa?
I don't see any serious wounds.
Probably a concussion.
I see.
Armin, you haven't eaten, have you?
I'll go get it.
You need to eat.
Mikasa!
Mikasa!
There's Eren!
What about Eren?
Those three scoundrels again.
They took the bread I bought.
And he went to get it back.
I wanted to stop them!
Wait!
Give it back!
I'm sorry.
Give it back!
I told you it was profitable.
There's nothing to give back. I ate it.
Did you find it?
There was food for three days for him and his family.
Are you kidding me?
It's a pity.
Forget it, man.
It's a pity.
I can rip it off and give it back.
You'll like it.
You got it?
Then pay him!
Hey, you!
Hey!
You're a drunk, useless soldier!
Get up and start the fight!
You'll die, friend.
You see, kids are just fooling around.
What the hell are you talking about?
Take it off!
Come on, you'll be fine.
Someone will come to get us now.
What?
Eren!
Take it off!
It's Mikasa!
Mikasa?
What are you doing here?
Eren, if you don't set the fire on time,
Mom will get mad again.
You little bitch!
I'll kill you!
You asked for it!
Eren!
Stop it, Mikasa!
Wait a minute!
Nice one, Karat!
Don't think about giving up, Mikasa!
What the hell?
I told you to stop the fight,
didn't I?
Come on, repeat it!
How can I repeat it?
You're a waste of taxes!
Oh, you piece of shit!
Don't get mad.
It-Is a good one!
It's for the police constable.
Hit him!
Shake the 이렇게 out of theeau, Hannes!
Will you manage?
Don't retreat!
Hey, you fools!
Come on!
Damn!
Stop it!
Listen, guys, it's not a joke anymore.
Fuck him! Let's run!
Stop!
Wait!
Wait!
Eren!
I don't care about that bread anymore!
Thank you!
Eren, it's time for us to go home too.
Come back without me!
Eren!
Hey, don't move!
Eren!
Stop!
Eren!
Mikasa!
Armin, where's Eren?
Mikasa, calm down!
You can't move!
We don't know how seriously you're hurt!
Where is he?
They took Eren.
Ymir, Bertolt and Reino.
Eren, he...
He couldn't handle the armored man.
It's been five hours since then.
Did anyone follow them?
No.
Why?
All the horses are on the other side of the wall.
If we want to save Eren, we need to wait for the elevators.
They'll bring them and we'll be able to lift the horses.
And you have to wait too.
Capral Hange and the other officers are seriously wounded and can't move.
We need more soldiers.
And with experience.
Do you understand?
Again?
Does it hurt somewhere?
No.
It must have hit my head.
But I'm fine.
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
When Eren took Eren...
I was in a hurry...
I was fighting with Capral Levi right away.
And in the end...
we managed to bring him back with a miracle.
But now, it's been five hours.
Tell me, Armin, why, why does Eren always run away from us so far away?
It's true, if you think about it.
Eren, he was constantly leaving us and running away, breaking his head.
I guess that's how it was predetermined for Eren.
Everything I want is to be next to him.
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.
Mikasa, have you woken up?
Are you hungry too? Here, take this.
Armin, catch it.
As usual, except for the dry stuff, there's nothing.
Not so good, but not bad.
As always.
By the way, it's the same as always.
Since the good old days, the two of you have always had to clean up after that lizard.
That's the way it is.
I'll tell you.
Times are different, and the places are not the same at all.
But you guys haven't changed a bit.
Right?
Zodiacs and giants are a bit different in size.
Well, the main thing in this story is that the lizard is still not a particularly cool fighter.
And it doesn't matter if there are three or five of them, he'll carry on at all times.
As long as Mikasa or the soldiers come, he will be thoroughly beaten.
But you know, I've never seen him win.
But I haven't seen the one who gave up after the defeat either.
He's so stubborn that even I sometimes feel uncomfortable about it.
No matter how much you beat him, he would still get up.
That's him.
Do you think he'll let himself be dragged away without giving up?
Not in life.
He will resist until the end.
Moreover, there are only two enemies.
He will let them smoke, no matter who they are.
Until you or I come to help.
Has Aaron always been like this?
I liked the old days.
If you ask Aaron, he would say that the world was made of playful people.
But as for me, there is nothing better than being just a drunk, useless soldier.
If something will help me get these old days back, I will do everything I can.
No matter how long the journey will be.
I'm coming too.
Until you guys die, I won't get back the good old days.
The End
We're here.
Hey!
That's Zhenya!
Captain Erwin!
With the military police!
Just think, we've arrived at the top of the wall.
Probably, it's the shortest way.
Christa...
I would like you to stay here, but...
It doesn't matter what you say.
I won't stay.
I can't sit with my hands folded until the world is captured.
Don't you two understand me?
Christa is completely right, Armin.
We all have enough reasons to go after them.
One of which I refuse to believe.
That Reiner and Bertholdt are our enemies.
I won't believe it until I hear it from their mouths.
Captain Erwin!
You're on time, sir!
Is everything here without changes?
Yes, sir!
Good.
Turn the elevators!
Hange!
Bullshit!
Give me the map!
The idea may not be the best, but...
There's a giant skeleton nearby.
We need it right now.
But...
I don't think they can replace the traces of the armored giant.
But I think they'll lead us there.
Why?
I bet that even if they have enough power to transform,
they need to be afraid of the threat from other giants behind the wall.
Especially after such a fight.
They exhaled quite a bit.
Even if not as much as Eren.
Annie then cut herself off for a long time.
Let's assume for now that their goal is somewhere behind Maria's wall.
Taking into account the distance that they need to overcome.
We can safely conclude that they need to regain their strength.
Which means they need to rest somewhere where the giants can't reach them.
At least until dark, when they're not active.
Oh, Eren.
Are you awake?
Time for sunset!
If you make it to the Forest of Light,
they'll be in your hands!
They'll be in your hands!
Eren!
They'll be in your hands!
Follow me!
The Forest of Light
The Forest of Light
The Forest of Light
Eren woke up among the giant trees.
Seeking a way to escape,
Eren tries to turn back, but he's stopped by the world.
Deep in the forest,
the gap between Eren and Reiner grows stronger and stronger.
They need to be allowed to do everything once and for all.
Not just for themselves, but for all those who died.
Next time...
...in the forest.
