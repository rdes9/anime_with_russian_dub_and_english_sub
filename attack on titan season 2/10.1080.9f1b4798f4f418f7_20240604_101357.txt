The village is completely destroyed, but not a single drop of blood, not to mention the bodies.
So the people of Raghaka managed to evacuate?
If so, then it turns out that the giants had fun in an empty village.
Do you believe in hard work?
And in general, how did they manage to escape if they didn't take the bodies?
What happened here?
What does all this mean?
Moblit, we found him!
This way!
Here he is.
Moblit, here, look.
Is this a portrait of the parents of the horse Springer?
No.
Is this a portrait of the parents of the horse Springer?
It's very likely that it is.
We'll kill him!
Wait!
What the hell is going on?
The invasion of the giants!

Episode 35
Children
Will you choose your dark skin?
Or the future of Christ?
Choose
Hey
Hey, tell me
Who is our enemy?
Ymir!
Who knows
It's decided
You're sorry, Aaron
What
What
What
Watch us
What
Watch us
I say
I say
You're so dead
I say
You're so dead
I can't!!
Else, you must be dead
The position and the world is clear to me.
When she became a human again,
then most likely she was a nomad
and lived only for herself
until she met Christ.
Despite the fact that Christ is very kind,
there is another reason to recruit her.
Christ is very important
for the ruling family of the sects.
If it turns out that Aaron is not the bearer of the coordinates,
our task will continue.
Then it will be much easier to search.
If Christ is under our wing.
They are close.
What are they talking about?
Are they really going to tear their claws
before sunset?
Let's finish this.
When we come here next time,
we will take Annie, Christ
and return home.
And we will never enter this land again.
Yes.
And our task will be completed.
And what about you?
We will return home.
Tell Annie about your feelings.
What are you talking about?
You're talking too much.
Only the blind would not notice.
No, I ...
Come on, don't whine.
You are both killers with the death of the priests.
Who else can understand
what we had to go through?
What is it, Rainer?
Aren't we waiting for the dark?
No, we're leaving now.
Aaron, don't think about resisting.
Come on,
make fun of me.
Look at my condition.
I think I'm capable of tripping.
But it will be for you.
Die!
Die!
Die!
Die!
I'll kill you!
I'll destroy you!
Hey,
why are we leaving already?
Amy,
when you became a human again,
did you remember
who you ate?
No,
I didn't.
Only
what it was five years ago.
One of your friends?
I see.
I'm sorry,
but I don't remember him.
It's not surprising
that you forgot.
It was the same with us.
What do you mean?
I doubt that Aaron
remembers something.
So that's how it works.
Do you hate me for it?
I'm not sure.
I don't know.
You probably
didn't want to eat a human.
How long have you been
wandering
outside the walls?
About 60 years.
I couldn't
wake up from
the endless nightmare.
Red smoke.
What?
Captain, we're surrounded!
There's a way around!
Should we go there?
No.
We'll be late for any detour.
We'll break through.
Everybody, get ready for battle!
First of all,
we need to find a place
where there are no giants.
We need to go as far as possible.
My giant is not very fast.
If they surround me,
I won't be able to protect you.
Then why didn't you wait for the sunset?
Smoke?
Did Red come to save us?
If they were able to build the line,
then they managed to get the horses through the wall.
I didn't think
it would happen so soon.
It must be Captain Erwin.
He's a strong opponent.
Damn,
isn't she that close?
Eren held us back.
Could it be...
her?
Yes, she's here.
Reiner!
She's here! Christ is with them!
What?
If we take her, then now!
How do you know?
You can't see her from here.
I know, and that's it.
She's so kind-hearted,
she's going to save me.
I know it.
Even if it's so,
we can't do it now.
We need to wait.
What?
Our chances of success are too small.
How are you going to get Christ out of that line?
Seriously?
The moment one of your warriors
eats me alive?
I don't believe you!
Believe me!
Christ is as important to us as she is to you!
Then take her now!
Confirm your words!
Now or never!
I want to see her now!
Otherwise,
I may never
see her again!
You can't do it!
Forgive her,
Ymir.
We should take our own lives
instead of
going back to her.
I promise you!
I'm going to save Christ
from this battle!
Please, trust us!
For now,
just calm down!
All this is just for her
good!
Do you understand, Ymir?
Is it really for Christ's good?
All this?
Yes!
Okay.
Thank you.
It's all happening again, Christ.
I've been through so much,
but I have to
deceive myself again.
Look,
there's something
that suits you.
What about her?
Yes.
Come with me.
Now you have to live with us.
A whole new life opens up for you.
A whole new life
needs a new name.
Do you understand?
On that day,
for the first time,
I lied to myself.
Back then,
I was only
inspired by the fact
that I had no choice.
But...
This is Mrs. Ymir.
She inherited the blood of our king.
While Mrs. Ymir is with us,
we are blessed with immortality.
Mrs. Ymir!
To be honest,
everything was not so bad.
The food was not cold.
And my bed was not on the floor.
Mrs. Ymir!
And most importantly,
for the first time in a while,
I was needed by someone.
For the first time,
I could be useful to someone.
And for me,
nothing was more precious.
Mrs. Ymir!
Mrs. Ymir!
It's all her!
She told us!
She convinced us
that she was the blood of our king!
We just believed her word!
Back then,
I was reminded
that everything in my life
was a lie.
Is that true?
No!
It's true.
I am Lady Ymir, and the King's blood flows in my veins.
That day I lied again.
If my lie had saved everyone,
however, nothing happened.
However, nothing happened.
No!
Please, don't!
I beg you!
No!
Then I thought,
what punishment is this?
But this punishment is not for the fact that I lied to all these people,
looking at someone else's face,
but for the fact that I instigated myself as if I needed someone else,
for the fact that I was lying to myself all this time.
This is my punishment.
Giant!
Run!
No!
When I opened my eyes,
I saw an immense freedom before me.
If there is a destiny in the world,
I just had to laugh at it.
And then I swore one thing.
I will never lie again.
I will never lie to myself again.
Since then, I have always been honest with myself.
So, how did it all end?
She was given the name Christa Lenz,
and she was sent to serve the cadets.
What a pity.
It would be better for her not to appear in this world at all.
Huh?
Are you talking about me now?
Well, well.
That's not what I meant.
And then...
Hey, you!
Are you trying to behave well?
Well...
Then I met you.
I immediately realized that you were the same as I am,
to the bone marrow,
that you were lying to yourself.
Give our hearts back!
Yes!
That you are trying to inspire yourself with all truths and falsehoods.
But you know, Christa,
that's why I don't ask you to understand.
Just...
give me one last chance
to be honest with myself.
I'm sorry.
I'm stronger than anything else in this place.
Stop it!
Temir!
Don't you think that in a forest like this
I can tell the difference?
Temir!
Stop it!
We're going to fall!
Do you think I don't care?
I can transform.
Let my giant form be weaker than yours,
but I can quickly jump over trees.
Maybe I can catch Eren
and run to the Intelligence Legion.
I think we'll even survive.
If you don't agree to take Christa right now,
I'll get in your way and fight you.
What are you talking about?
You don't care what happens to her?
You can't save her that way!
Yes, let it be so.
Even if I lose Christa to the future,
I'll do everything I can to survive and see her.
Because I'm a rare, destroyed human being.
You'll never understand me.
This girl smiled and was kind to me,
although she knew perfectly well what kind of person I was.
Don't be mad at me.
I have one idea.
If I fight them,
it'll be much easier for you to make legs.
Or we'd better kill each other.
Do you want to see how far I've gone?
A flash?
Right in the deep forest!
I saw the light!
Such flashes accompany the transformation into a giant!
Do we have time?
Divide the formation!
Looks like the enemies have already turned into giants!
Find Aaron and bring him back!
Another one of the police?
Our goal is not a battle!
Prioritizer, rescue and retreat!
Jill, lead the horses!
Yes, sir!
Let's go!
We must find the enemies and inform the others!
Now they must run from the forest!
Let's split up!
Aaron!
Where are you?
Was that a giant scream?
From the deep forest!
Don't hide from me!
Stop!
It's Ymir!
She's in the form of a giant!
They took her!
Hey!
Ymir!
Why are you alone here?
Where's Aaron?
And Reiner?
Bertolt!
So this is Ymir?
She turned into a giant and disappeared!
She's gone!
She's gone!
She's gone!
She's gone!
She turned into a giant and fought Reiner!
Ymir?
Did you manage to run away from Reiner?
Where are the others?
Tell us something!
Ymir!
Tell us something!
I'm scared!
We're in a hurry!
She's watching Reiner?
Something's wrong here.
Why?
She's looking at us one by one.
Ymir!
I'm so happy!
You're all right!
What?
She took Christ from Eve!
What are you doing?
Follow her!
She's fast!
We can't catch up!
Why are you doing this, Ymir?
It can't be!
I'm the only one who saw this happening!
Yes!
She's definitely our enemy now!
I think she's with Reiner!
And we just got caught in her trap!
There she is!
Reiner!
Bert!
Oh no!
Eren is taking her away!
Let's go!
Let's chase her!
I'll definitely get him back!
Even if it costs me my life!
The End
The End
The End
The End
