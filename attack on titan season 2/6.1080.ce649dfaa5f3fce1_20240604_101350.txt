Again?
What kind of sound is that?
Having stopped in the ruins of the castle of Udgard to take a little breath,
the scouts were suddenly attacked by the giants,
who had lost all hope.
No, no, no!
No, no, no!
Dad, no! Dad!
However, at that moment...
Christ, that's why all I can do is hope
that you will live a glorious life.
Ymir, stop!
Ymir suddenly turned into a giant.
How do I hold on, Ymir?
Do you want to live?
Grab on!
Bad news.
Ymir!
No!
It can't be!
I still haven't given you my...
my real name!
After that, the main forces of the Legion finally arrived.
Die!
They took the initiative in their own hands.
And then, on the battlefield of this massacre,
the others learn the shocking truth.
Ymir!
I didn't say my name.
My name is Historia.

Episode 31. The Warrior
Episode 31. The Warrior
Be quiet!
Raise it slower!
Be careful!
Be careful!
How is Ymir?
How is she feeling now?
She lost both her right hand and her legs.
And her insides are all bruised.
An ordinary man would have died a long time ago.
An ordinary man, you say?
Reiner, grab him!
Yeah!
Please, believe me!
I'm telling the truth!
Ymir turned into a giant to protect us.
She saved us from other giants.
She did it risking her own life.
Is it not proof that she is not our enemy?
Yes, the fact that she hid her abilities from us
is unforgivable.
She may know something important for humanity,
but she decided to keep silent.
Most likely, she didn't reveal herself to us
because she was afraid of herself.
But now she is different.
Ymir is an ally of humanity, not an enemy.
I know Ymir better than anyone.
She is much easier than she seems.
Is that so?
Of course, it would be nice
to build a reliable relationship.
After all, the information she has
can be really valuable.
So, let's work together.
But you know,
even if she is a simple person,
the situation in the world
becomes confusing with every new day.
Are you talking about your real name,
Race?
Yes, that's right.
Is Race the aristocrat family?
Yes.
I see.
Nice to meet you, History.
Yeah.
How is Ymir?
She is still in a coma.
It seems that the couple who left her cult
and the wound stopped the bleeding.
Nevertheless,
it is necessary to take her to the throne.
There she will be given proper help.
I hope for you.
Yes, ma'am.
For now,
let's think about the main task
to patch up the mess.
Yes, ma'am.
Damn, it hurts.
Are you all right, Rainer?
Yeah, I'm fine.
The giant almost grabbed my hand.
I feel so sorry for him.
I thought I would die.
Even a strongman like you
is sometimes sad.
What are you talking about?
It's the second time already.
Yes, Armin.
What?
Do you remember how the giant
grabbed my hand and almost crushed me?
Oh.
That time.
I almost died twice.
I will die at such a pace
and will not notice.
I chose this path myself.
But the life of a soldier is hard.
It seems that my fighting spirit
will be broken before my body.
However,
until we dig the wall,
there is no time to let it go.
Yes.
The two of you have already
walked enough in the distance
from your hometown.
It's time to stop somewhere.
He's right, Rainer.
Let's go back to our homeland.
Don't you think it's time?
After all we've been through,
we still have to do something.
That's right.
We are so close to the goal,
just a few steps and that's it.
Huh?
What are you talking about?
Thank you, Mikasa.
Are you hurt?
I'm fine,
but Rainer was grabbed by the hand.
And Emir, well, you saw it yourself.
Who would have thought
that she was also a giant?
Well, Sasha.
Everyone is in the assembly.
Emir, we'll figure it out later.
And the horses.
And the horses.
And the horses.
And the horses.
And the horses.
I'll cut off a group of scouts
to search your village later.
And you, for now,
focus on fixing the wall.
Okay?
Yes!
And I thought
that the giants would be here
right in the gutter.
Hannes?
This is the front-line detachment
of the garrison.
With a report on the location
of the garrison.
There's nowhere to break through.
We've been looking all night.
But the wall is intact
and safe, at least
between the Trost and Krolvo districts.
What did you say?
We met the Krolvo detachment
and ran back.
And we didn't see a single giant
along the way.
We know for sure
that there are giants along this side of the wall.
Did you really inspect everything?
Did you miss the piano?
I didn't drink!
By the way, what are you all doing here?
If there's no mess,
we have nothing to do here.
For now, let's go back to the Trost.
Let's go.
Nevertheless,
don't lose your vigilance.
We'll jump ahead of you.
The wall is intact.
What does it mean?
Nothing like this happened
five years ago,
and all of a sudden it's all over.
The world is getting more and more unpredictable.
Wait a minute.
We need to talk.
About what?
Five years ago,
we broke through the wall
and started attacking humanity.
What if there's a giant
who made a dig right under the wall?
If that's the case,
it'll be much harder to find a hole.
I'm an armored giant,
and he's the titan here.
All right, now we have to
even use horses.
We have to be wary of giants.
What?
What the hell?
What's going on, Reiner?
Our main goal
was to ensure the extinction of all humanity.
But now
there's no need for that.
Aaron,
if you agree to go with us,
we won't need to break the wall anymore.
Are you in?
What?
Wait, I don't get it.
I repeat,
why don't you just go with us?
I understand it's sudden,
but we have to go.
Right now?
I don't know yet.
But
it's something like our homeland.
Well,
what do you say, Aaron?
It's a good deal, isn't it?
You'll get rid of all the problems in no time.
What can I say?
Hey!
We're leaving!
Well, we're here.
I had a headache yesterday
because of that.
What?
What is it, Capral Hanje?
It's just...
I finally got it.
Dasje Enne Lenhardt,
one of the most famous
in the world,
including the documents of her past.
Enne?
Yes.
Now, with the reports,
it's a mess.
It's written
that there were two more
who entered the 104th Corps
from the same settlement
as her.
And these two
Reiner Braun
and Bertolt Gouver.
Five years ago,
it was a mess.
All the documents
about their families
either went to aboom
or were lost.
So, during the formation
of the long-range intelligence,
their detachment was given false information.
They were among those
who attacked the right flank.
What?
And what does it mean?
They could have
given this false information to Enne.
What?
Why would they tell Enne?
Hey, hold your horses, Armin!
You can't just...
I understand, Eren.
These facts are not enough to accuse.
But just in case,
I would like to know
about their relations in the Cadet Corps.
I knew that Reiner and Bertolt
were from the same place,
but they weren't close to Enne.
That's right.
I won't remember anything either
so that these two
don't talk to Enne.
Although Enne
is not one of those who likes to chat.
During lunch,
she always stood aside
and sharpened her bottom, although...
Oh! I remembered!
I heard that she likes sweets,
but you're always so gloomy.
Me too.
I don't remember anything like that.
But...
As their comrade, I think
that's a weak basis for suspicions.
Bertolt is silent about one thing,
but Reiner is like an elder brother to all of us.
And he doesn't look like a cunning man
who can fool everyone.
I agree with him here.
Reiner was all out
when we fought with the Gigantes.
She would have crushed him
if he hadn't...
What's going on?
Reiner was free,
but...
Enne changed her direction
and pulled Eren
out of the dark.
I...
I said that maybe
Eren was in the center of the rearguard.
But...
Enne was too far away to hear.
What's going on?
Reiner didn't seem
to be interested in Eren's location.
Then...
Where could he be?
Come on!
I assumed where Eren was
just because Reiner was the first
to ask.
Moreover,
after all that
the Gigantes was watching
with her own hand.
He could have left her a message
and cut him off.
Reiner could have.
What's going on?
What the hell are you talking about?
What are you...
Eren!
No. Listen to me.
If we meet Reiner with Bertold,
behave as usual,
without any suspicions.
And, of course,
don't mention Enne Leonhardt.
Don't even think about her.
It doesn't matter if they're Enne's accomplices or not.
We need to get them deep underground
and take the rearguard.
Well, is everyone clear?
Yes!
Listen!
Are you tired?
You're right, Bertold.
You've been through so much,
and now you're tired.
Well, Reiner is really tired.
Anyway,
if you're an armored Gigante
who wants to destroy humanity,
why would you ask me such questions?
And what do you think
was supposed to happen?
That I'll take you under the basket,
like, of course, let's go?
You're right.
You're damn right.
What did I think stupid?
Looks like the roof is really gone.
Okay, let's go.
To be continued...
I've been living in the countryside
for too long.
I've been surrounded by morons
for three years.
I've been infected with tuberculosis.
We were just kids
who didn't know anything.
If I just didn't know
that there were people like that,
I would never
become
such an underdeveloped
pathetic waste.
It's too late.
I don't know what's right anymore.
I have
only one choice left.
To take responsibility for the consequences
of my actions
and, being a warrior,
do my duty
until the end of my life.
Reiner,
are we going to do this
here, now?
Yes.
Let's finish this
right here and now.
Eren!
Run!
Eren!
Eren, get out of there!
Eren!
Emir!
Eren!
Eren!
I'll go back to my homeland
that we lost.
That's all I want now.

Because it's early in the morning
But today, but today morning
It's about to spring
But tomorrow every single day

Show me, show me

The answer we have to decide

G44
So don't
To be continued...
The 60-meter Titan and the Armored Giants are fighting against the Intelligence Legion.
If their mission and the truth are to destroy all of humanity, then they have no way back.
Reiner and Bertel put their lives on the line for the sake of the mission, because they are warriors.
Next time...
Strike, throw, finish.
