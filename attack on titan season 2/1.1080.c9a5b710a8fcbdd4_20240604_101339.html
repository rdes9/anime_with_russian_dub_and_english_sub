But then...
When the wall was pierced by the titans, the battle for the survival of humanity began.
When the wall was pierced by the titans, the battle for the survival of humanity began.
After the countless victims among the soldiers and civilians,
it turned out that the titans were hiding right in the middle of the people.
And finally, five years later, after the fall of the first wall, humanity was able to capture one of these lozenges, Annie Leonkart.

However, the new threat of humanity was already breathing right into his back.

Hey, look!
Titan? What? Right in the wall?
What do you mean?
What do you want, Capral?
What? Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Could it be that he was there by accident?
Or is it not an accident at all?
Capral?
Do not let the sunlight fall on this Titan!
Giant Incineration!

Episode 26. The Roaring Titan.
So far, we have covered the Titan in the wall with sheets.
After sunset, we will take more serious measures.
I see.
Captain, do you know how he ended up there?
We could not imagine that the Titan was in the wall.
Believe it or not, but no one could.
Only a few people know this fact.
What the hell is going on here?
We were fighting the giant right here.
But they don't tell us anything.
Everything is as usual.
But the most terrible thing here is that
for the death of all these people, there is no official interpretation.
Well, then.
It's time for us to tell the truth.
What was it about the Titan?
And what did he forget inside the wall?
And why did you keep quiet about it all this time?
I have a sore throat.
The church is destroyed.
The parishioners are confused.
It's all your fault.
I will demand compensation for the damage.
And now, let me down.
As you wish.
Will you go with a direct lead?
Capral!
Back!
Enough already!
Can you even imagine what the legion of reconnaissance
has shed so much blood for?
To bring back the freedom that the giants deprived us of!
I didn't feel sorry for my life for that.
Listen to me.
I'm not asking for it.
I'm ordering you.
Do you hear me?
If you don't talk, I'll go to someone else.
One way or another, I doubt that your life will be enough.
Come on, let me go.
Are you sure you want this?
Yes.
So be it.
I'll give you death.
Hanji!
By killing me, you can only be sure of one thing.
At any cost, we fulfill our destiny.
So, now!
Let me go!
My God!
Well, that was a joke.
Tell me, shepherd.
Are all the walls made of titans?
Capral!
Yes.
I forgot what it was.
The feeling that left me after the first climb over the walls.
Fear!
Hurry!
Report to Erwin!
Hurry!
The giants broke through the wall of the rose!
You know, my village is not so far to the south from here.
My town is not so far either.
Damn it.
They don't even let me visit.
Maybe we can get through at night.
My ancestors told me not to come back until I've grown up.
And they told me that such a plump will never become a soldier.
Well, I've had enough brains.
Since I'm in the top ten of my class.
When I come back, I'll shut them up for Plintus.
Coney, if you're serious, I can help.
Huh?
Why?
Don't you think it's strange that we're on duty in the city?
We're not allowed to train or wear uniforms.
And the strangest thing is that the rest are at full parade.
But this is not the front line.
We're behind the wall.
Who are we fighting with?
Well, I think the bears are supposed to lead here.
Yeah, the bears.
There's enough fire and arrows against them.
I heard push-ups!
It looks like an experience!
What are you talking about, Sasha?
Do you want to say that they're giants?
If so, then it turns out that the wall has fallen.
Mike?
Toma, take the three giants and report to the command.
And...
And inform the districts.
Most likely, there are no giants among the recruits of the 104th Cadet Corps.
A group of giants is moving south!
In the wall of the rose!
The brook is pierced!
I'm not kidding! I heard the steps!
Is everyone here?
Nanaba?
A group of giants half a kilometer south of here.
They're heading here.
You don't have time for equipment.
Take the horses and inform the surrounding houses and settlements about the evacuation.
All clear.
From the south, you say?
What do you mean, they went through the wall?
Hurry up, people!
There won't be lunch until you get everyone out of here!
Mike?
Nine.
There are nine giants in this group.
They managed to break through the wall of the rose.
And we couldn't figure out the secrets of the titans or understand where they came from.
This day has come.
All humanity is doomed.
Well?
No, not yet.
A man loses only when he stops fighting.
As long as we keep fighting, we won't be broken.
Let's go!
As soon as the group of giants reaches the forest, we'll split into four mixed teams of cadets and soldiers.
Then we'll split in different directions at the same time.
To avoid a fight by chance, the main goal is to report.
Anyone familiar with this area?
Me!
My town is to the north from here!
I know these places well!
What?
Horses!
Horses!
To the south.
My village is to the south from here.
That's where the giants came from.
I'll take you to the nearest village.
And then...
Please let me go home.
All right.
You'll lead the southern squad.
Yes, sir!
Coney, I'm with you.
But...
There are a lot of giants in the south.
It's most dangerous there.
What are you talking about?
I told you I'd help you get through.
You're with us, aren't you, Bertolt?
Of course.
I'll go with you.
As you can see,
today is yet another dark day in the history of mankind.
When will we be able to surpass mankind again?
Now!
A group of giants has reached the edge of the forest!
To the chain!
Jump as fast as you can!
Why?
What if they run away?
Faster!
They're going to catch up with us!
Helger!
I'm leaving the southern squad to you!
Mike!
Yes, sir!
Capral Mike decided to become a bait?
He won't survive!
I'm going to him!
I'm going to him!
I'm going to him!
I'm going to him!
I'm going to him!
I'm going to him!
I'm going to him!
I'm going to him!
No!
Now everyone is on the board!
Just believe in him!
He's going too far to the right of the left!
He'll definitely come back alive!
The End
Oh, Eren!
You had a fight with someone again, didn't you?
They were the first to start making fun of me!
I'm going to have to put up with them!
I think...
Mikasa had to save you again.
Thank you.
Eren!
No matter how cruel your enemies are,
you can't jump into a swamp with your head!
You're a man!
Hold on to yourself!
You're the one who has to protect Mikasa!
You're the one who has to protect Mikasa!
You're the one who has to protect Mikasa!
You're the one who has to protect Mikasa!
You're the one who has to protect Mikasa!
You're the one who has to protect Mikasa!
You're the one who has to protect Mikasa!
You're the one who has to protect Mikasa!
You're the one who has to protect Mikasa!
You're the one who has to protect Mikasa!
You're the one who has to protect Mikasa!
You're the one who has to protect Mikasa!
You're the one who has to protect Mikasa!
You're the one who has to protect Mikasa!
You're the one who has to protect Mikasa!
You're the one who has to protect Mikasa!
You're the one who has to protect Mikasa!
Eren...
What happened?
If I see a new one in the warehouse, I'll take it for you.
Eren! Mikasa!
There's been an accident!
The giants!
They broke through the gate!
There's no way we can get through with these giants.
Are you going?
I have a choice.
I'm going to leave Mike to watch over 104. It was a wise decision.
I'm sure he'll handle the situation.
Yeah.
I'd like to believe.
Four more.
No. It's time to leave.
I've won them plenty of time.
It's time to leave.
I've won them plenty of time.
But...
I'm worried about this anomaly.
Something's wrong with it.
It's more than 17 meters long.
It's huge.
I'm not saying it's the first big giant I've ever seen.
It walks around, pretending not to notice me.
I have no doubt it's an anomaly.
Finally. Just in time.
Now I won't have to stay here until sunset.
There it is.
It's a horse!
It can't move!
Stop!
Didn't I tell you to leave?
Didn't I tell you to stop?
What is your weapon called?
It's a belt.
You're flying on it.
I'm sure we speak the same language.
Maybe you've lost your voice because of fear?
Oh, you also use blades.
It seems you know we're in a warm-up.
Oh, come on.
I'll take it.
A man loses only when he stops fighting.
As long as we keep fighting,
we won't be broken!
You can move.
You can move.
No! No! Stop! Stop!
Don't!
No! No! No!
You can still speak.
You can still speak.
I must admit, you've come up with an interesting device.
No! Stop!
Stop!
No!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
The Giants have suddenly appeared behind the Rose Wall.
The cadets of the 104th Corps have scattered around the district to warn everyone.
Meanwhile, Eren and the others are moving in to help them.
And when Sasha returns to his native town, he faces his past.
Next time...
I'm home.
