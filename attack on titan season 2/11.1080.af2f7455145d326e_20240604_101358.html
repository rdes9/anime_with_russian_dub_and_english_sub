        <pre>Here she is! Reiner!
Yeah!
Oh no!
Erron is taking everything away!
Units!
Take the giants away!
Everyone follow me!
Erwin!
Are you out of your mind?
Are you trying to use us as bait?
That's not my goal!
The military police is doing a great job!
Do your duty as a soldier!
Erron!
Erron!
Erron!
Erron!
Erron!
Come on! Do your duty!
The armored giant is running away with Erron!
We have to stop him, whatever it takes.
Giant Conquest!

Episode 36
Attack
At this rate, he will not escape!
We catch up!
I swear, this time I will kill them both
without hesitation
And if the world will be in the way
let him beat himself
I will do it
no matter what
Chris!
Ymir!
Ymir!
Chris!
No
This is a story
I'm sorry
that I swallowed it like this
I'm sure
you're mad at me
Ymir!
What's going on?
What are you doing?
We came to save you and Ira
Don't save me
Just sit and don't move
I'm going with Reiner and Bertold
and you too
will be with me
There is no future inside these walls
Listen, history
Behind the walls
it's not as bad as you think
especially
because there is no one there
who would say that it's better
not to be born at all
Of course they won't say
giants don't have the habit of talking
they just eat me and that's it
All of us
It's not without sin
and if you close your eyes
it's not that bad
Ymir, I don't understand anything
everything you do and say is nonsense
Is it all because of them?
Reiner and Bertold
did they threaten you?
Quite the opposite
Am I right?
Ymir!
I will fight with you
just let me go
even if you can't tell me everything
no matter what
I will always be on your side
Ymir!
Look
Reiner is coming
on our heels
If we ran away right away
we would have been able to get away
but because you wanted to take
Christ
they will catch us now
How come?
Ymir!
It turns out we did all this in vain
You changed your mind again
Do you want to
force Christ to rot
inside these walls at your will?
What's wrong with you, Ymir?
Ymir!
Let me go!
Let me go!
It's history
To tell you the truth
the reason I took you
was
to save
my skin
Huh?
A long time ago
I stole the power of the giant
from one of their comrades
I can't hide from them
sooner or later
they will kill me
but
if I give you to them
and cooperate
they promised
to shut me up
to close my eyes
because you are very important to the church
because you know the secrets of the walls
All this
is not because of my family
Yes
When this world
began to collapse before my eyes
I thought
that next to you
I would have confidence in the future
Then
in that battle at the castle
I almost died
I was scared of death
and I will do everything to survive
I was nothing
I told myself
that everything was for you
but in fact
it was for myself
Please
History
Please
Please save me
As I said, Emir
Whatever happens
I will always be on your side
Reiner, protect us
I knew it
that first
I will have to kill Emir
Wait, Mikasa
Don't kill Emir
It depends only on her
What's the matter?
I will kill anyone who stands in my way
Choose
Wait
Emir will be killed
if she doesn't obey Reiner and Bertold
She has no other choice
There are not so many lives left
that I don't care about
My enemies took care of it
six years ago
So you will not be able
to find compassion in my soul
As you understand now
I have no time
no desire
Christ, choose
Eren or Emir
Which of them?
Or will you be confused
No, Emir
Don't resist
You will die
Don't move
Good, Eren
Don't jump
Hold him in your hands, Bertold
It is impossible to make him calm
If he decided something
he doesn't care
I know
That's why I hate him
Let's teach him a lesson
Come on
Get out
Bertold, get him back
Hey, it's Rosa Grisda, Bertold
Reiner
All this time
you were quiet and lied to us
as soon as you could
Guys, tell us
that it's all a lie
Hey, hey, hey
Do you think you can run away like that?
Come on
You will
We shared our blood
under the same roof for three years
sharing joy and sorrow
Bertold
Your poses
are something, at least draw a picture
We all
with impatience waited for the morning
to see your new masterpieces
even predicted the weather
And you
were the only one
who trusted us
and slept without a back
next to your victims
So it was all a lie?
All our talks
about how we will survive together
about how we will forget
everything together
until we grow old
So it was all a lie?
Yes?
Guys
Did you think all this time?
What's the difference now?
It's better to focus
on how to take their heads
Slow down at least a moment
and we will miss Eren
They are the enemies of humanity
That's enough
As if
someone will kill people
at will
Who do we have to be
for this?
Do you think
we want it that way?
People hate us
We have done so much
that we deserve death
We have done so much
that we can't get it back
But
we couldn't
make up with our sins
And only by pretending
to be soldiers
we could at least
calm down
And it's not a lie
Kony,
Jean, yes, we lied to you all
But it wasn't all a lie
Our friendship was real
We have no right
to ask for forgiveness
But
someone
please
someone please
find us
Bertolt
Give me Eren back
No
I can't
Someone has to do it
Someone
has to get his hands
in the blood
Hey you
Get him out of here
I can't believe
what you've come up with
Erwin
He brought a whole crowd of giants here
Guys
Get out of there
I'm warning you
Keep your distance from the giants
The story!
What's going on?
Is this hell?
No
But it will be soon
All units, attack!
At this very moment
the fate of all of humanity
will come to an end
If we lose Eren
we won't be able to find a future
where we can live in peace
Take Eren
and retreat
We'll give our hearts back
Mikasa
Crazy legion
Yes, not exactly
hit on the head
Hey
What happened there?
What's going on?
Don't move
If you don't get rid of the giants
it won't get any better
Well
Hold on
Bertolt
Just a little bit more
Just a little bit
It worked
He took his hands
Here's our chance
Hey, Mikasa
Don't you see all these giants?
How are you going to get through this crowd?
There's a whole horde of them
No less
Go!
Captain Erwin!
Go!
Eren is very close
Go!
Yes
Go!
Mikasa
You piece of shit
Let her go
We've already achieved so much
We're taking Eren with us
with us to our home town
Shit
It's all because of me
Because of me everyone's going to die
Bertolt
Armin
Those who can't sacrifice something important
there's nothing to hope for
Go!
What?
What should I sacrifice?
My life?
Or something else?
What?
You're going to run away like that?
You're going to leave your girlfriend here
and run back to your homeland?
You're going to leave Annie?
Do you know where she is?
She's being tortured
deep underground, far to the north
in the Utopia area
Hearing her screams, you'd understand
Even with all her regeneration
her body doesn't have the strength
to get rid of the pain
They've taken all the precautions
so she doesn't die
And while we're talking
they don't give Annie's body a minute of rest
They torture her
with all the sophisticated ways
they can come up with
Damn it!
I'm going to kill you all!
Back off!
It worked!
My first giant
and the world!
Christa!
What have you forgotten?
What have you forgotten?
We're leaving!
We'll be back soon!
Connie, Sasha, leave me alone!
Let me go!
What?
Emir said that if I don't go with her
Reiner and Bertel will have to kill her
If she gives up on me, she'll be spared
because we went with them
What the hell?
Is that what Emir said?
Yes! So let me go!
It can't be!
She's lying to you!
Sasha, you're absolutely right
Do you really think that
the one who beat you
because of her last strength will do that?
Emir will only move
if you get into trouble
I don't know if they're going to kill her
or not
But you should calm down
He's right
If you stay,
they're going to kill you
It's not going to be better
You know what?
It's even a fool to understand
Damn it, Reiner
He's making a mess of us
like giants
Eren! Mikasa!
Eren!
Eren!
Thank you for watching
Let's move on
To be continued
To be continued
What is the enemy?
What is the war?
The intelligence legion
continues to fight in confusion
not knowing who to raise their blades at
Will they be able to come
to the future they want so much?
Next time
Scream
