Eren, you're a man, aren't you?
Hold yourself in your arms!
You're the one who has to protect Mikasa!
Stop it!
There's no way you're dealing with this one!
GIGANT CLASH!

EPISODE 37
Episode 37. The Scream
Damn it, Rainer! He's messing with us giants!
The Scream
It's all your fault! It's all because of you that my whole plan blew up!
Damn it, Captain!
Emir! Kony, let's go there!
Okay!
Captain!
I can always be replaced.
You'd better concentrate on saving Eren!
Every minute counts!
Eren!
Hannes!
Hannes!
Kony!
What luck!
Guys!
Now watch!
I'll avenge your mom by killing this scum!
Hannes!
Help the old man!
Rein!
Rein!
Why?
Does he really care that Eren is being eaten?
Get out of the way!
You piece of shit!
Emir!
That's it!
And how am I supposed to be now?
Since there's no point to Rein anymore,
should we help the scout squad to survive?
But then, what do we do next?
Even if we manage to survive all this by some miracle,
we definitely won't be able to escape the impending collapse behind the walls.
Now is the only chance to take history to the other side.
No matter how hard I try, I can't defend it alone.
Kony!
You're mistaken!
My real name is Historia!
Tell me, Emir,
why did you try to drag me out of the walls?
It's not because you wanted to save yourself!
Yes.
There's no other way.
But why?
Why do you need all this?
For my sake?
Are you trying to protect me again?
Gigant!
Emir!
You're always talking about selfishness!
Listen to yourself!
Stop living for the sake of others!
From this moment on,
let's live for the sake of each other!
Listen to me!
Listen to me!
Silence!
From this moment on,
let's live for the sake of ourselves!
I don't understand why,
but when I'm with you,
no matter what's going on around me,
I'm not scared!
Damn it!
Don't you dare, Mikasa!
You're badly wounded!
Untie my hands!
Hands?
Hurry!
I'm supposed to be in his place now!
Who said I was done?
And she...
is mine!
Eren!
Wait!
We're trying to save you!
It's time to pay the price!
Just look!
What?
Captain!
Are you armored?
He's coming this way!
Jean!
Jean!
Are you alive?
Come on, get up!
Damn it!
Shit!
What's going on?
Eren!
Captain!
Eren!
Now...
I have to become a giant!
Or was it all in vain?
Eren!
Eren!
Nothing!
Nothing has changed since then!
You're as useless as you were that day!
Nothing!
Mom...
I...
can't...
I still...
can't do anything about it!
Eren!
It's not like that!
Eren...
Listen...
I have to tell you something.
For...
always being by my side.
For...
always being by my side.
For...
always being by my side.
For...
always being by my side.
Thank you.
Thanks to you...
I was able to achieve my goal in life.
Thank you.
And for...
tying your scarf on me.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I'll tie it up again.
As much as you want.
From now on...
as much as you want!
Eren!
Why...
are they...
devouring her?
I don't know what's going on,
but we've got to get out of here!
Get out of here, quick!
Yes!
That's why...
that's why Reiner needs Eren.
Eren needs Eren.
Eren needs Eren.
Eren needs Eren.
We need Eren to get to Reiner, even inside these walls.
There's still a future.
How ironic.
Why did the coordinate get the least suitable for it?
We need to get it back.
I can confidently say that no one should have gotten this power.
Eren, this is for you!
Don't come any closer!
You bastards! I'll destroy you all!
This is bad, Bertolt.
I can't protect him like this.
What about the giants?
Eren!
Eren!
Get in!
Armin!
Hurry!
Don't miss this chance!
Back off!
Emir!
Hey, Trashyla! Why are you stuck?
Let's get out of here!
Forgive me.
What?
Emir, where are you going?
Leave her alone!
But Emir!
At that moment, we didn't understand why Emir did that.
However, the armored giant didn't pursue us anymore.
THE END
Emir, why did you come with us?
Well, I don't know.
Probably because I'm a fool.
Consider me a souvenir in case I come back home.
You can't come back empty-handed.
Emir!
If you hadn't come to break the wall,
I would never have woken up from my nightmare.
I'm just...
...giving you back your debt from those times.
Perhaps no one except me understands...
...your situation.
Thank you...
...Emir.
I'm sorry.
Forget it.
Maybe it's not so bad to be a goddess sometimes.
THE END
When it became clear from the reports that the wall rose could have been pierced,
its population was forced to hide in an underground city
within the perimeter of the Shina wall.
However,
due to the fact that more than half of their population
were fed with food from the reserves on the outskirts,
food would be enough for a maximum of a week.
And then people would inevitably catch each other in the throat,
start stealing or killing to survive.
To prevent this from happening,
a week after this persecution,
the authorities officially announced that the wall rose was intact.
THE END
It's Hanji.
Come in.
Excuse me, Erwin.
I'm glad to see you, Commander Pixis.
It's good that we found you.
And this is...
The scout from 104th.
Coney Springer.
Coney was born and raised in the village of Ragaku.
The village where the invasion began?
Yes.
I discussed with him the results of our investigation into his village.
We came to the conclusion that our guesses are correct.
He's here with the report.
I was dragged away again.
And because of that, the scout squad lost more than half of the most experienced soldiers.
Just for my sake.
But...
But there was no loss on the way back.
The giants, ignoring us,
all together rushed to chase Reiner.
We sat down with Jean and thought about this topic.
But...
We have an idea why the giants behaved like that.
Because of you, Eren.
Of course, it's just a theory.
But otherwise, what happened,
there's no way to explain it.
You won't be jealous, Eren.
Whether these people died in vain or not,
now it depends only on you.
The sooner, the better.
Yes.
You're absolutely right.
Otherwise, there's no way.
I will control the giants.
I'll lock up Maria's wall,
catch Reiner and make him pay.
That's what I can do.
I'll lock up Reiner and make him pay.
That's what I can do.
I'll lock up Reiner and make him pay.
What?
Were the giants who carried out the invasion
born of the Zorogaks?
It seems that the giants are actually people.
We don't have any proof yet.
So, in your opinion,
I was wearing here and turning the circles,
cutting people to the left and right?
Right?
We don't have direct evidence.
Erwin.
What the fuck?
You're smiling.
Yeah, just like that.
We just managed to make one more step on the way to the truth.
Step, you mean?
At this pace, we will run out of people.
It's not worth it.
The last step turned out to be right.
And someday we will destroy the wall
that hides the truth from us.
THE END
THE END
THE END
THE END
THE END
THE END
THE END
