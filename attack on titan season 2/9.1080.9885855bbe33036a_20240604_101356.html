        <pre>Episode 1
Follow me!
Hanje!
Give me the horse!
Kapral! Where are you going?
To the village where there was a giant who couldn't walk.
Are you Aragaku?
I must see him.
What kind of nonsense are you talking about?
You're not in the condition to go up.
There's something in it. I must study it.
I understand you.
I'll go there myself.
And you lie in the abyss peacefully.
Turn the formation!
Formation for detection of enemies!
Eren!

Episode 34
Weakness
Oh, Eren!
Are you awake?
What the...
My hands!
Eren!
Look.
I'm in the same position as you.
We definitely didn't have a good day.
Emir.
Why...
Why didn't you touch me?
I'm sorry.
It's my fault.
We were a little in a hurry.
When I bit you for warm-ups,
I miscalculated the position of your hands in the giant.
So...
So...
I lost.
Eren!
Stop!
Hold on to the horses, Eren.
You'd better look around.
We are in the forest of giant trees on the inner side of the sea.
And as far as I remember, there are no walls near it.
In short, we are on the territory of giants.
Look.
Apparently, the one below is anomalous.
It looks like he's just lying around.
But he doesn't take his eyes off us.
And there are enough small freaks.
Even they are a problem for us.
He's just watching, but he doesn't come any closer.
He's ready to argue.
He's still shy.
And these friends are ready to eat.
A couple of scoundrels.
Right now, they're the only ones who have the maneuvering skills.
Reiner put your weight on yourself.
So I don't think that by turning into a giant,
you can solve the problem.
Not only that, they also turned into giants.
But they also turned into giants.
And again, there are a lot of giants around.
It will be hard to make legs out of these captured lands,
even in the form of a giant.
Now is not the best time to climb on the horns.
No.
At the moment, you will not turn into giants.
It's kind of stupid to always count on it.
Your name is Reiner.
And you are a giant.
I will never count on it.
Your powers are limited.
And now they all leave just to heal your bodies.
Are you out of your mind?
What reason do I have to believe your words?
Well, not that I would know.
All the nuances of turning into giants.
Unlike you, I'm totally profane in this.
I will not argue.
Listen, Reiner.
You promised to tell us how the era will begin.
Why did you need us?
And what are you going to do with us?
We will take you back to our homeland.
I understand that you are not going to listen and obey us.
But, as Emir said,
this place is full of giants.
If we cling to each other in the throat,
we will be eaten by other giants when we weaken.
So we will have to wait until the very night
until the giants calm down.
It doesn't matter if you are going to run away there.
Or we will still drag you further.
We need to wait for the darkness.
Why didn't you stay in the shape of a giant and run home?
Why waste time and stop here?
Did you take a breath and decide to rest?
Show a little imagination.
I need to think.
It's unlikely that it will be so difficult to get out of here.
To wait until they weaken, turn and run with their heads broken.
However, will I ever be able to turn into a giant?
Reiner says no.
And in general, we must take into account the fact
that even Reiner had to stop here.
After all, if my giants don't have enough strength,
I will simply be beaten by the others.
It turns out that we have to sit here and wait for the darkness.
Everything can be.
No.
They don't have to wait until the darkness.
They definitely won't wait until our bodies recover from the wound.
They need to make their move while we are weak.
So I definitely can't do anything.
So I...
What happened to the others?
With the intelligence squad?
Do they really come here at all times?
If this is so, no one will come back from them.
What's the point?
Those giants didn't move badly at night in the ruins of the castle.
Maybe these can?
Local giants don't move at night.
Who's who, but you should already know about it, Emir.
By the way, why can Emir turn into a giant?
Unlike me, it's not like she doesn't know anything.
Whose side is she on?
I don't know her true intentions.
And I don't know much about her either.
It's decided.
Now I need to get the information.
I need to find out everything about these bastards.
And then get out and get out.
But for that I have to...
...crush all my emotions.
And heal them as quickly as possible.
A giant for three hours.
Smoke signal.
I see smoke.
On the right flank.
We're going there.
Report to the right flank, get off the center and keep course.
We only have time until sunset.
That's why we need the shortest way.
Mikasa!
Hey, Mikasa!
Mikasa!
Stop chasing!
You're going to overtake the Avangard so soon.
Because of you, the whole structure will collapse.
I understand you.
But I told you, Aaron is definitely not one of those who will just let you go.
Do you agree?
You know he never gives up.
That's why our task is not to lose our heads and faithfully go to help him.
Just like then.
Yes.
Rainer, do you have some water?
If I don't drink it, I'll die of thirst.
Yes, it's a matter of life and death.
But at the moment, we have nowhere to get it.
What is, is.
You can't come up with a worse situation.
Yes.
By the way, since the giants appeared yesterday morning, we've been eating as much as we could.
We didn't drink, didn't eat and didn't even sleep.
But fortunately, the wall turned out to be intact.
So we deserved to rest once.
Then we'll deal with the elevations.
Rainer.
What?
I think we've done enough for this.
As for me, we did a good job in this mess.
No, I understand that soldiers are supposed to do their duty.
But we deserved it.
Listen, Rainer.
What the hell are you doing here?
What?
What do you mean?
I'm not saying we're asking for a captain's whip or something.
No, I'm not talking about that right now.
Oh, by the way, where did you dig that gun then?
You really saved my skin then.
I don't know.
I don't know what you're talking about.
If you don't know, then why did you dig that gun?
You really saved my skin then.
Then we asked for help from Christ.
He really頂plанно talerved me.
I think he especially took aärke at me.
Christ!
You畫 witch, finally scared me fine.
You're angry, Eren? Did I say something bad?
If you want to die, say it straight!
Calm down, Eren.
How can you not look? It's not normal.
Isn't that right, Bertrand?
If you know something, finish the silence and put it out.
Huh?
Reiner, do you remember that you're not a soldier?
You and I, we're warriors.
Reiner! What are you doing?
Reiner! What are you doing?
Hey, why...
Marco...
...is being eaten?
They're coming!
Yes, that's right.
Huh?
What was that?
In general terms, I think I understand.
It also seemed strange to me.
Why would a guy who broke through the wall risk his life to save a horse?
Everything he does is contradictory.
But he doesn't see it himself.
I have no idea what happened to him, but it's possible.
Initially, he was a warrior with one task, to break the wall.
But he played the soldier for so long that he forgot who he really was.
No.
Unable to cope with his sins, he convinced himself that he was a soldier
and was defending the walls to preserve his mental balance.
In the end, he believed in it.
And as a result, his mind was divided, and the memories were mixed.
It seems that Reiner is not the first to make a complete mistake.
Yes, it's written on Bertold's face.
That's when someone as kind as you...
Enough!
Shut your mouth!
I'm sorry.
I've digged too deep.
You...
You're completely out of your mind.
Why are you so carefully cutting yourself a victim?
What are you trying to achieve?
On the day you only thought about when you talked to us.
Listen, Bertold.
I'm talking to you.
I told you everything.
I told you, looking right into your eyes.
About the day when my mother was barely alive.
Stop it!
I told you, didn't I?
And about how a piece of the gate that you tore down fell right on my house,
which was crushed by my mother.
You remember, don't you?
What I told you.
What you felt.
That's what you felt back then.
Back then, I...
I was very sorry for you.
Oh.
That's how it is.
Yes, you...
You both...
You're not soldiers, you're not warriors.
You're just murderers.
Mass murderers, who don't know how many innocent people there are.
You think I don't know?
I don't need to remind you of that at all.
Then don't you think you're the same as us?
You're no longer people.
Thanks to you two, the world has turned into hell.
You're happy with that, aren't you, murderers?
Well, what do you want?
To get rid of these murderers?
Do you want repentance from us?
Or are you waiting for excuses?
Will they help you?
There are no more of us that you knew.
If you feel better about your victims,
then at least shout out loud!
SILENT NIGHT
For sure.
I'm still too naive.
I will try.
Try so...
I want you to die the most painful death you can.
Just wait.
Are you serious?
Huh?
Please, Eren.
Stop carrying this child's blanket, or I'll be disappointed in you.
Huh?
Hey, Reiner!
What kind of monkey is that?
Monkey? What are you talking about?
Huh? You don't know him?
That's weird.
When you were looking at him, you both had your eyes twinkling like children's.
You're a monkey.
What are you talking about? What kind of monkey is that?
Listen to me.
Recently, there was one guy who made the destruction happen.
He was a ferocious, overgrown titan.
He somehow lifted giants inside walls.
He probably wanted to appreciate our abilities.
And it seems that our friends want him.
If you get to him, you'll get home, won't you?
And you... did you know that?
What else do you know?
Tell me everything!
Don't rush. I have my own reasons for this.
What other reasons?
Eren, if you think that by killing these two, we'll get rid of everything,
then you're very wrong.
What?
Then who's the enemy?
Enemy?
If I tell you, then...
Emir, do you think this world has a future?
If you know so much, then think about your actions.
You won't be against going our way, will you?
Trust you?
What else?
You don't believe in it, so what's the point?
No, we believe in you.
Because your goal is to protect Christ.
In this matter, we can trust each other.
Maybe it seems to you that I'm joking,
but is it so hard for you to believe that we, too,
wish only the best for Christ?
Or you'd better put your hopes on Eren and choose him instead of us, huh?
You're probably thinking how to take advantage of Eren and run away from here,
because you won't have many chances of survival if we take you.
To be honest, that's the way it is.
If you go with us, I can't guarantee you safety.
But if we're talking about Christ, then for her, we'll do something unimaginable.
Will you choose your worthless skin or the future of Christ?
Choose for yourself.
This world has no future.
Why is that?
What kind of monkey is that?
What's going on here?
Hey!
Hey, tell me!
Who's our enemy?
Emir!
Who knows?
It's decided.
I'm sorry, Eren.
The scouts are...
...already...
...near.
Shit!
God damn it!
God damn you, Emir!
There's only one hour left until sunset.
I'm sorry, Eren.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Dark will speaks with us,
Light сes a Temple.
Downforming is the most important thing on Earth.
Allin was knocked up on the beach.
But Reiner and Bertolt plan their own escape with the help of maneuvering drives.
Meanwhile, Emile, thinking about his past feelings in the past, offers his own plan.
Next time.
Children.
