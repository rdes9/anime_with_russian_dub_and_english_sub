        <pre>What gives?
Where did the shit get to?
What finally happens?
Hey! What's going on here?
Did anyone see the bodies?
No.
Neither did I.
How is that possible?
The giants destroyed the village, and there's no blood.
They must have all escaped.
That means they didn't eat anyone here.
Especially your family.
That's right.
That's probably true.
Yeah, and it's true.
It's impossible to believe that the giants ate everyone and didn't leave a trace of blood.
It's not just about the bodies.
If people would have been evacuated from the village in time,
then why would the giants destroy the house?
If they really didn't have anyone.
But the strangest thing in this story is that they were worth it.
If they escaped without horses,
then their chances of survival are very low.
Is that enough?
Let's go.
Our task is to find and assess the wall.
Yes, sir.
What's that?
Hey, horse, move!
We're getting away from Helger.
Reiner, did you hear that?
He's about to...
I didn't hear a thing.
That's enough beating around the bush.
We have a task.
If I think about it,
I don't know how,
but it looks like my mom's.
Horse!
What's going on?
What's going on?
Hundreds of thousands of lives.
It depends on whether we fulfill this task or not.
Maybe your family has escaped,
but it's not the end.
If you're a soldier, think about your duty.
Yeah, that's right.
You're damn right.
I'm sorry.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Episode 28 South-West
Episode 28 South-West
We're getting closer to the wall.
There are no settlements in these places.
Yeah.
We haven't been here for long.
Okay, now we're going south.
But why?
There shouldn't be a village to the south from here.
We need to figure out
what part of the wall was broken through.
We'll jump along it from the west
until we find the ridge.
But we don't have a maneuvering abyss with Christa.
There may be a lot of giants in the south.
We have a high chance of getting into their stomach.
Let us go to the front line.
Emir!
I can't.
I need to deliver a message to the hounds.
I understand you very well,
but you still signed up for the soldiers.
Emir,
I'm going to perform my duty until the end.
After all,
I decided to go to the intelligence legion myself.
But you're here for a different reason.
You entered the region just because...
Do you think I went because of you?
Then why are you here?
You tried to persuade me to go to the military police.
You even gave me your place.
With my own strength,
I definitely couldn't get into the top ten.
Anyone would say that the top ten should have been you, not me.
I don't know how you could, but...
Why?
You're doing so much for me.
Isn't it all because of my family?
Yes.
Exactly.
Christ,
don't take it to heart.
The only reason I'm here is me and only me.
That's how it is.
I'm on my shoulders.
The target has entered the defeat zone.
All guns, get ready for fire.
Not now!
Wait for the signal!
Yes, sir!
Fire!
Did you do it?
He's ready, right, Rika?
They'll never be able to break our defense.
No.
The strength of the giants, in their quantity,
will attack the group,
and this ambush will fall.
But still,
what is it?
It's strange.
Captain Hannes, is something wrong?
How many times have we jumped and met not a single giant?
Captain,
considering that we're approaching a breakthrough,
it's quiet and quiet around us.
I really hope that we'll be able to explore everything
and return without consequences.
When?
When will it happen?
When will it happen?
At any moment they can suddenly jump out of the shadow.
No.
The closer we get to the breach,
the more unavoidable this moment comes.
Captain Hannes,
the closer we get to the breach,
the more unavoidable this moment comes.
Damn it!
It's driving me crazy!
Did you also walk along the wall?
Yes.
Did you manage to find the breach?
Huh?
We walked along the wall from the west, but we didn't find anything.
Isn't it on your side?
No.
There's no breach on our side.
Have you checked the horse?
No.
We wouldn't have missed the hole the size of the giant.
Maybe we should check it again?
It wouldn't hurt.
But our horses, as well as ours, have been destroyed.
It would be a smart thing to do now.
It would be a smart thing to do now.
But our horses, as well as ours, have been destroyed.
It would be a smart thing to do now.
Yeah.
What's that?
A ruin of a castle?
The ruin is still there.
But it's going to be fine for one night.
Yeah.
The night is bright.
Hange.
Hey, you.
You have such boring interests that you're already playing with stones.
Yes, I do.
It's not just stones.
It's a reinforced piece of leather left over from the gigantes.
What?
It didn't disappear?
Exactly.
Even after Kenny came out of the form of a giant, it didn't disappear.
It didn't disappear.
So I thought, what if, in comparison with a piece of the wall,
it turned out that its structure and composition were almost the same?
Then it turns out that the support for that wall was the titans.
And if I'm right, then its surface is made of nothing but their reinforced leather.
That's what Armin was talking about.
Then...
Wait, let me finish, Armin.
Now it's going to be very difficult for us to make a gap in the wall of the rose.
To do this, we need to find a balloon of the right size.
However, if Eren, who turned into a giant,
can apply the ability of the leather reinforcement to make a gap in the wall...
We need the same material for the payment.
If the stoned part is preserved by returning you back to the human form,
it will work.
I think we should at least try.
If we really succeed,
then we will be able to make the wall of Maria.
Until now, we had to carry a large amount of materials and supplies with us.
The need for hiking stops behind the walls limits us.
But if we don't need so many resources anymore,
we will get to Shiganshin in two counts.
What if we turn this plan over at night?
At night?
Yes.
In the dark, giants are less mobile.
I see.
The small detachment will be able to get to the wall of Maria without any problems.
Despite the fact that things are getting worse now,
hope still hasn't left us.
Yes, but don't forget
that everything depends on Eren's ability to make a gap in the wall.
I understand.
It's not quite appropriate to ask now,
but do you think you can do it?
Who cares what people think?
You have to.
There is no choice.
The options are the same.
The strength of our people at the exit.
And we don't have a new exit.
Be kind, don't make a mistake.
Yes, I will make a mistake at any cost.
Any.
The basement.
The basement of my house.
If my father was telling the truth,
we will find answers to all our questions there.
I see.
Here is Ermeh.
Come on, live!
Or you'll get lost here like a child.
What is this?
And what did you expect to see here?
All this is the consequences of a broken wall.
Mommy, daddy!
Hey!
Where are you going?
Look closely at the faces of people who have lost everything.
It was these people who tried to get rid of you.
If you want your church to wake up and the giants break through the walls,
they will gladly push us all into their evil past
and we will die in the most terrible way.
They will devour everyone, no exception.
As soon as we leave the army, we will be on the territory of the giants.
Aaron, can you go up?
Yes, I feel much better.
Your horse is in the western elevator.
Let's hurry.
Yes.
Capral, let's go faster.
Moblito, give me a minute.
Well, haven't you changed your mind?
There is no time to play in Beryulka.
Do you understand?
So will you say or not?
Decide already!
I have nothing to say to you.
Other believers are the same as me, and this will not change.
And on that, thank you!
We are so grateful to you for all your generosity!
This is too important a decision to be made by one person.
The church must always adhere to the holy will that we have sworn.
Thank you very much!
Whose will is it?
God or someone else?
I have nothing to say.
However, I can tell you in the name of the one for whom the Holy Will was entrusted to us to observe.
Observe?
This man entered the Intelligence Legion this year.
And her name is ...
Excuse me!
Cadet 104 Corps!
Sasha Brown has arrived!
For her?
Who is it?
Excuse me!
This is for you, Cabral!
Look for her immediately.
Only she can know the truth that even we are not able to.
Her name is all I can tell you.
The rest depends only on you.
If she is from 104, she is in the highest of events.
We are moving forward!
We need to hurry!
Sasha!
What are you doing here?
Come here!
I have already managed to report to the commander.
After that, I was authorized to deliver this message to Cabral.
A message?
Well, thank you!
Well done!
Who is it?
This is the girl from 104.
She is the smallest among us.
She has long, golden hair.
And she is ...
cute.
And she is always with Ymir.
Huh?
Ymir?
What does it mean?
Ymir?
You ...
Get up everyone!
To the roof of the tower!
Quickly!
They were not visible in the dark.
But what did the moon look like?
Why?
Why are they moving?
The sun has already set a long time ago!
What's going on?
Hey!
Look!
Huge!
What is it?
Titan?
No.
He looks more like a beast.
Yes!
He's going to the wall!
So, did you understand everything?
Yes!
Let's go to the front!
Calm down, Armin.
You all listen.
We are now divided.
I rely on you.
Maybe Armin gathered you together and just like that.
But now we have no one else to count on.
Do you understand?
Armin, work with Hanji.
Combine your knowledge.
Yes!
Mikasa.
I don't know why you're so attached to Eren, but...
Use all your abilities to protect him.
Yes!
Definitely!
And for dessert.
Eren.
Hey!
Stop!
Stop, stop, stop!
Enough!
Get down here!
Why are you so empty?
Did you hear me?
If it weren't for you, I'd be drinking right now!
It's all because of you, you bastards!
Cadets!
Stay here!
Get down on us!
It's time to launch our drive-in.
Fight!
Kill them!
And for dessert, Eren.
Learn to hold yourself in your hands.
Don't lose yourself from the overflowing anger.
We have no right to make mistakes.
Yes!
In the southwest, near the wall, there is an abandoned castle.
Its towers can be seen from the walls.
The course to the castle is Uthgard.
THE END
The text was read by Zendoss and Elodie.
The video is intended for free home viewing.
The continuation follows.
THE END
THE END
THE END
In the search for Bresha, who was made into giants, the Legion of Investigation arrives at the castle of Uthgard.
Their rest was short because of the appearance of giants capable of moving even under the cover of night.
The Legion bravely fights.
As the giants dig deeper and deeper into the castle, Reiner recalls the episodes of his past.
Next time...
Soldiers!
