For this brought to you by Pap reiterate
Rep髀
Come back to the homeland that we lost.
This is all I want right now.
I went to the soldiers in the hope of getting into the military police and living behind the walls without knowing about the grief.
And you, why did you sign up for the soldiers?
I decided that I had to kill them.
I decided to cut all the giants to one.
Yes, actually by hand.
It seems that your meeting with the giants still could not shake your spirit.
If that's what you're going to do.
Aaron Jagger, then?
What the hell are you?
Traitors!

Doesn't matter
哈哈
I'm a
Where are you now, c'mon get out of here!
Eren!
If only
They got meotta be Boss that time
That's exactly the way it had to happen
C'mon
That was supposed to happen
Then why?!
It won't!
Everybody, get out of the wall!
He's grabbed Ymir!
Not only that, he's got someone else!
He's eaten!
How... How did that happen?
Bertelt!
Everybody, get ready for the attack!
We're going to take this Titan down!
He's a threat to all of humanity!
We're going to attack them at the same time!
We're going to take him down!
They're slow, just like in the reports!
There's no advantage over size!
Compared to the regular giants, this one's going to go like a horse!
We can do it!
Now!
We're going to cover his neck!
What the...
It's so hot!
Quick! Back off!
My hand!
Water! Bring me some water!
Is he trying to disappear again?
No!
Everything's different now!
That time, he disappeared instantly!
But now he's staying in this form!
And he's releasing the heat like it's not weak, it's so hot!
While he's protecting his body with steam!
Our drives are useless against him!
What are we going to do?
It's all right.
We'll wait.
Troops 3 and 4!
Take position behind the target!
Roshad, take the lead!
Yes, ma'am!
The second squad is waiting here!
Lauda, take the lead!
Yes, ma'am!
It's not clear yet how long he can stay like this,
but he'll have to come out one day.
We'll wait for this moment and attack.
But remember,
we can't capture them,
kill them,
without hesitation!
Armin and the first squad are following me!
Let's take care of the armored ones!
It's hot!
Christa!
Connie!
Move back!
I'm leaving these two wounded to you!
But...
I'm sure Ymir is not dead, so...
Please,
save her!
All right.
Reiner and Bertolt!
How are they?
They didn't even have any guns.
Please, find them and take them out!
Goddamn it!
Bastard!
So much bullshit about the soldier's duty and honor,
and during the sparring,
the bastard was fighting with half of his strength!
I can't take his strength!
I can't even move!
I can't move!
I can't move!
I can't move!
I can't move!
I can't move!
I can't even move!
I thought you were a reliable guy,
always calm under any circumstances.
First of all, you think about your friends, not yourself.
I remember.
I even wanted to become as strong as you.
Everything is useless!
Eren's blows!
And my blades don't pierce!
And unlike Enya,
his whole body is hardened!
Eren!
Hey, Reiner,
I don't know what kind of shit you're doing in there.
But you guys are unbearable pieces of shit!
For the whole history of mankind,
no one has ever fallen so low!
I will destroy you.
You have no right to exist in this world.
What were you even thinking about?
Just a memory of yours,
the face of the scoundrel for justice,
makes me disgusted!
I don't give a shit about you!
Oh, you!
Destroy yourself, parasite!
I'll grind you into powder!
Damn, it hurts, Enya!
Enya!
Have you ever heard that you can beat someone with half a strength?
You went all the way with me.
Shouldn't I have responded with the same strength?
And since you're a man,
you could have been more gentle with a fragile body like mine.
What?
You're joking, aren't you?
If it's about strength, then why did I sit back?
And you're still standing?
Well...
I didn't use my strength during the throw.
I used the defense technique
from the enemy that surpasses you in strength.
It wouldn't stop you from mastering it.
Okay, okay.
Let's take a break.
Enya!
I surrender!
I surrender, do you hear me?
You surrender?
You'd better learn something,
instead of fighting right away,
how to use your strength,
or how to talk to girls.
I got it!
I promise to learn, so let me go!
Do you really want to learn this?
Where did Reiner come from?
Enya!
I also want to learn
the technique.
I don't even know.
This technique is against people.
I don't think you'll use it.
But I'm very curious
if it'll work on an animal like you.
Are you serious?
Are you serious?
Hey, hey!
Did they decide to fight back?
It's a fight of the century!
Who's going to win?
I think it's Enya.
Are you out of your mind?
I bet my whole lunch on Mikasa.
Who do you think, Sharon?
I...
And the truth, too.
Huh?
How did it all end then?
No.
What did I remember it for?
Is my life running in front of my eyes?
However, what's the difference?
Worse than now.
I've never been worse.
Eren!
Don't!
You can't win this exchange!
Step back to the wall!
Eren!
Don't you dare fight him!
Eren!
Bad news.
You've lost control again.
He dropped the armored one.
Wait, is that...
Is that Enya?
I don't know.
What the hell are you trying to do by doing all of this?
But if you think about it,
you're just making a lot of mistakes.
Eren!
Eren!
Eren!
Eren!
Eren!
The biggest one is not who he is.
What was I supposed to think before he taught me to fight?
It worked.
He's in my hands.
There's still a chance.
Not so fast!
Eren!
It's that simple. I won't let you go!
Eren!
He did it!
Eren!
Do you hear me?
Step back!
You need to step back to the wall!
Reiner's goal is to capture you.
And he almost did it.
We need to run away and not let that happen.
But Armin, Reiner won't let him get away so easily.
It's dangerous here.
Get out of here!
Eren!
Excellent, Eren!
Good decision!
He came to his senses.
Yeah, but as you said, it's almost impossible to get away from Reiner.
What the hell?
That's the same Titan.
Where did that bastard come from?
Where's Eren now?
What happened?
Eren and the others are on the other side.
Eren?
What's that?
Eren in the form of a giant?
Listen, Eren.
To get you out of here, you need to stop Reiner first.
And then you'll have time to win.
You can hold on to the armored trap to break his leg.
Our blades are useless against him.
So move your brains and come up with something yourself.
Mikasa!
My blades!
Use them!
I'm counting on you.
I'm counting on you.
This time the escape will be an unconditional victory.
It's you, guys, who got lost and didn't make it in time.
You got yourself in the corner.
Let's go.
Quick!
Look!
His leg!
His leg!
Don't lie on the ground, Eren!
Get up!
This is bad.
I can't handle his snatch.
Damn!
Since when did he become so fast?
Are we completely useless here?
No.
If his whole body was solid as a stone,
he wouldn't be able to move so fast.
In the ancient armor from the war of the past,
there were unclosed armor parts that were needed just for that.
The armpits, the elbow bend, the groin,
as well as the inner side of the knee.
If he doesn't come back,
if he still beats me,
come on!
Your head is mine!
Yes!
Yes!
That's right, Eren!
I got him!
Now the battle is decided by force!
What a freak!
Not enough!
Mikasa!
I cut it!
He can't resist anymore!
Get him!
Eren, can you do it?
Tear his head off already!
Take this traitor to court!
I can...
I can beat Reiner!
What?
What is he doing?
No use!
Push him up a little more!
He stopped.
Eren!
Eren!
He's alive!
But why is he there?
Everyone be on guard!
He's calling the giants!
Not a single giant has been spotted in the area!
The last ones!
Come on, shout for help while your head is on your shoulders!
Look, it's coming off!
What's that with the armor?
Why is he shouting like that?
Hey!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Watch out from above!

The Battle of the Iron and the Armored Giants
The battle between the Iron and the Armored Giants suddenly ends.
When it falls from the wall, a huge titan pierces Mikasa and hurts her.
Hanna rushes to her,
to protect the Iron from his insolence,
and proudly stand with him in the same line.
This has always been Mikasa and Armin's main desire.
Next time...
In pursuit.
