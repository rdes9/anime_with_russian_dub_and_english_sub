The last words are for the
Those who betray the past
They should be punished
On that day, they were looking at us
With various faces
If you throw away anything, you'll get rid of the devil
You'll never get what you want
Offer, offer
Offer your heart
All sacrifices
Are for this moment
Offer, offer
Offer your heart
Open the future
With your hands
Episode 29
Soldier
Cadets!
Stay here!
Get down on us!
It's time to launch the entrance of our drives!
Fire!
Kill them!
I think someone was here recently
It's strange, there's a wall nearby
There must be a bandit and a base
The ruin of the Udgar castle
It was written on one of the signs
Who could have thought that there was a castle somewhere here?
Hey, look here
Check what I found
Helger, did you drink it?
Yeah
It's not all written
Are you going to drink now?
Are you stupid?
It's not too late
It's not stupid
There are only smugglers here
You say
It's like we're some kind of bandits
It wouldn't hurt you to have a rest with cadets
Giants won't wander around at such an hour
But we'll still set up a watchtower
We're leaving
In four hours before dawn
What if they really didn't break through the wall?
Where from?
Then all these giants could have appeared
The answer to this question
We'll leave it for tomorrow
What if everything is not as bad as we thought from the very beginning?
Just thinking about it
Yes
We almost didn't see any giants here
It's not enough to break through the wall
The only giants we saw were those from the first group
Coney, how's your village?
It's destroyed
Giants took everything by the stone
How terrible
But they didn't eat anyone
I think they ran away from me
At least something good
You said the village was destroyed
Houses and everything around was crushed to dust
But there were no victims among the inhabitants
If they still ate
Then there would be blood and other traces
There was nothing of this
It turns out they all survived
Only something gives me peace
There was a giant in my house
He couldn't move on his own
But he was lying on top of the house
And what's strange
I don't know why
But he reminded me of my mother
Why?
Coney, are you after yours again?
When did you live?
You're a fool
Do you think your mother could have been with that giant?
Why are you wearing a cap?
Hey, Coney
I know you're a little tight
But it's not a gate to the village
Shut up already, okay?
I know, it's nonsense
If you got your finger in the pie
Then your daddy is a giant too
Because if not
Then they couldn't have
Shut up!
Go to sleep!
Ymir, what are you doing?
What do you want, Rainer?
A date?
Come on
I had the impression
That you don't need women
Yeah
And it doesn't seem like you have an interest in guys
I decided to search a little
In search of something edible
After all, today may be my last day
And I don't have time
What about the village of Coney?
Did you specifically cling to him?
I'll be grateful if you continue
So he won't have time to worry about his family
What are you talking about?
Oh, what a catch
Not that I would love a herring
Is there anything else?
Let me take a look
I don't know
A can?
What kind of letter is this?
I don't know
Is it written herring?
So you can read it without any problems?
And what is this?
I don't know
Ymir, you...
Everyone get up!
To the roof of the tower!
Quickly!
Did you hear me?
If it weren't for you, I would be drinking now!
It's all because of you, you freaks!
Fight!
Get your hands off me!
You're a piece of shit!
Look!
The herring has crushed the mellusca!
You fools!
Stop it!
Can't you just bend over so you don't get stuck?
I'm used to fighting
Write it down on my account as a favor
You're my hero
I'll think about it
It's too late
They've already broken through the door
The giants have entered the tower
Go back inside and barricade everything
If you can't do it, run back in case
But that doesn't mean we can help you
And we don't know if we'll survive
Follow your duty
While you're alive, barricade everything
Is that clear?
Yes, ma'am!
I'll check how far they've gone
And you pull the boards and the sticks
Do whatever you can
Reimer!
Hey!
Wait, Reiner!
Stop!
He's always trying to do the most dangerous thing
See?
Yeah, he's got a bad habit
They're still downstairs
The doors are locked
But it doesn't look like it's going to collapse
It's holding the giants back
They're here!
Bring me something!
Is this...
Is this it?
Is this the end for me?
No, it's not the end
It can't be
What are you doing?
I'm going to get you
Reiner!
Reiner, are you okay?
Yes, Bertolt
We'll survive and come back
We'll get you back
Yes, yes
We'll come back
Reiner!
It's a gunner! Bertel!
It's a gunner!
There's a gunner, but the core...
There's nothing here!
We'll feed them the gun!
Get out of the way!
No!
It looks like some kind of miracle.
It worked.
Yeah, I don't think it's going to rise.
It's too weak for that.
And what's next?
We only have this knife.
Don't even think about it.
We'll see.
For now, let's go back upstairs.
If one gets through,
the other will be able to do it.
Koei!
Koei!
Reiner!
Hey, Reiner.
You're not here.
You're not going to fight with him, are you?
I think I have a choice.
Stop!
You're not going to fight with him.
I think I have a choice.
Stop!
If I can cut him,
and get him...
I let him go!
What are we going to do if they try again?
I don't think we'll be so lucky
to get another one.
Yeah, I agree with you.
I'm sorry.
Hold on.
It looks like your bones are broken.
Yeah, today is definitely my day.
We need to put the chain on and tie it up.
I figured it out.
Hold on.
Oh, sorry.
I have such a dirty rag.
That's not a big deal.
Thank you.
I got married to her.
How are you, Reiner?
I don't really feel well.
You know, Christa,
Let her get a little bit better.
Huh? Spit on her and she'll get better.
Reiner, I'm sorry for everything.
You always have to save me.
Although I also risked my life for my own sake.
One day we'll make up.
Come on, don't think about it.
It's my duty.
We're soldiers.
Come on, old man.
I doubt I could do that.
Tell me, Bertolt.
Has Reiner always been like that?
No.
He used to be
more of a warrior
than he is now.
What are you talking about?
What kind of warrior are you?
Let's collect everything that can be useful
so that we don't regret it later
when we die.
That's how the Legion does it.
Other soldiers weren't even close to them.
Well, I guess we're done with the big ones.
We're lucky with this tower.
Yeah, maybe we'll survive.
We're looking for recruits.
Okay.
What's that sound?
Horses!
Again?
What kind of sound is that?
Irkhenin!
What's going on?
It's useless.
They died instantly.
How come?
It's him.
The one who was walking towards the wall.
It's all that big titan.
There are more giants on the way.
Two of them are bigger than the first pack.
What?
They arrived just in time.
It's like they planned it.
I think they
played with us from the very beginning.
Bad news.
The gas is almost running out.
Did you get it?
The tower won't last long.
I almost ran out of gas.
What about you?
No gas.
And the blades.
We ran out of gas.
Did you also run out of gas?
Yeah.
How many did we take out in four?
I don't know.
I didn't have time to count.
You know what?
I think I did a good job.
But...
I'd rather eat something stronger in the end.
Helger!
I'm sorry, Nana.
I'm out of my mind.
I have no more...
power.
Helger!
Helger!
Damn!
Is it over already?
Thank God!
Oh!
How...
How could you?
Why did you do this to me?
What the hell did you do to this damn bottle?
They're gone!
Enough, Chris!
The tower is about to collapse!
You're going to fall!
But...
They're sacrificing themselves for us!
Nana!
No!
Not Helger!
Dad!
Don't!
Dad!
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
I won't do it again!
Dad!
No!
Go to hell!
Listen.
Are we really going to wait until everything collapses and we're eaten alive?
Is there really nothing we could do?
Damn it!
We're all going to die even if we don't complete the mission!
Me too.
I don't want to give up.
I wish I had some kind of weapon.
I could fight and die with them.
Chris.
You're being old again.
Calm down.
Don't you dare use their death.
They gave up their lives not to give you a reason to commit suicide.
No!
I wasn't going to do it!
You're not like Connie and our reconnaissance squad.
They don't want to die.
But you don't care.
You only think about how to die so that later you can remember the good words.
Not at all.
Connie.
Give me that knife.
Knife?
Give it to me.
Here it is.
Take it.
Thank you.
Why did you need it?
Huh?
Well...
See?
It's like helping in battle.
Emir.
What are you up to?
How should I know?
I'm not sure yet.
Emir!
Chris.
Maybe you've already forgotten about it.
Well, if this is the end, then remember the promise you made during training on the snow mountain.
I have no right to teach you how to live.
That's why all I can do is hope that you will live a good life.
Remember the promise, Chris.
Emir!
Stop!
Emir!

Survive the good life.
Leaving behind Christ and these words,
Emyr frees himself from the power of the giant.
In the past, telling his secret,
Emyr makes a very important promise to Christ.
And while Emyr fights, risking his life,
Christ shouts, throwing off the mask that he wore all this time.
Next time...
