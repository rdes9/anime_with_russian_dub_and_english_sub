        <pre>Super power giant
Those who betray the past
They should be crushed
What kind of face that day
Were you looking at us?
What should I throw away to make the devil laugh?
I can't even remember a single day
I can't remember anything
Devote, devote
Devote your heart
All sacrifices
For the sake of this moment
Devote, devote
Devote your heart
Open the future
With your hands
Episode 30
History
Come on! You're almost there!
Five hundred sixty two minutes
Not a bad result for such weather
I thought we'd give it a try
Even if someone would say that winter muster is so tough
Damn, I can't feel my feet
Hurry up, they've already let us in
I give you a tooth, they're cooking something delicious for us
Yum-yum
Hey! Christa is missing
Last time? I saw that she helped Daza
Daza is missing too
And they can't see the world
Maybe they're in the last squad
Definitely not in it
The last squad was brought by Thomas
They didn't see the three of them
Do you want to say they got lost?
Listen, they just don't have a chance
in such a fierce blizzard
Eren!
I'm coming back, we have to find them, I'm with you
You all go home
But Christa and... I know
We'll send a rescue squad after them from the morning
They won't make it there until the morning
We don't need more victims
Damn
Christa!
Christa, that's enough
Do you hear me?
That's not enough
Daza is in the grave with one leg
It's his own fault that he got into this training
He wanted to score points, but didn't make it
He's in the grave with one leg
He's in the grave with one leg
He won't finish until the evening
That's rotten
They don't have a chance
If he goes down, we have to expected
they don't think he would survive
He couldn't even do an A
There's another one, in which you make a deep mistake, and I can get to the base near the foot of the mountain, together with Daz, and you'll go forward so as not to risk yourself.
Will you do it? You have a lot less problems. We'll definitely get to the base with him. Hurry up.
Listen, why won't you ask me for help?
I can see that you're not going to save Daz at all.
You don't care. You've already given up and you're just waiting for death to come.
You hope to die here, don't you?
How so? I thought Christ was a good man.
You wanted everything to look like you were trying to save him.
If you want to be remembered as a hero who died trying to save a comrade, then drop it.
Well done. You can't do that.
You're mistaken.
I...
would never...
I...
It's you, the daughter of an aristocrat's lover, who they wanted to get rid of.
How did you know?
Oh, how?
It turns out it's still you.
I happened to hear about it.
I was sewing in the church in the inner city, and I was giving them different things to end things.
What a snotty story.
An illegitimate child can't be recognized by the aristocrat's father.
That's why they decided to kill her, and that's it.
Although if she had changed her name and didn't stand out, they would have left her alone.
And I heard that in the end the girl had to join the cadets.
Don't worry.
I didn't mess with anyone.
And I wasn't going to hurt anyone.
So you became a cadet just to find me?
If so, then why?
How should I know? Maybe because we look alike?
Do we have a similar origin?
Well, kind of.
Is that why you became a soldier?
Maybe. I don't know myself.
Probably not.
Did you want to make friends with me?
Are you kidding me?
You and I are not even equal.
We both got a second chance in this life.
But unlike you, I didn't take someone else's name.
If I renounce my own past, they will win.
I will live under my name and do everything in my power.
Only then will I be able to avenge them for everything.
And who are you compared to me?
Do you want to commit suicide for the joy of all the bastards who have broken your life?
Why do you want to destroy yourself, not them?
If you are so persistent, then use this rupture to change your destiny.
I can't. Even now.
We won't be able to get out of here alive, all together.
We can.
We can already see the base from this cliff.
We will drop Daz from here.
What?
I hope he will survive the fall and someone will notice him there.
Yes, he certainly has a bad chance.
But now it is definitely not for him to choose.
If the miracle does not happen, then he will freeze even before you drag him out.
Well, if we drop him, he will break.
Shut up!
Don't!
Ymir!
I'll do everything myself, so go alone!
How could this be?
Wait!
Ymir, wait!
Ymir!
Ymir!
Ymir!
Ymir!
Ymir!
Ymir!
Ymir!
Ymir!
Ymir!
Wait!
They both...
disappeared.
It will be better if you stay here.
As our instructor said, in the end there will only be more victims.
I'm going so that this does not happen.
We will not leave Christ and others.
Hey, where are you going?
Do not try to stop me.
You will need much more equipment.
You will not only not save Christ, but you will also have to help yourself.
An extra pair of eyes in the search will not interfere.
Guys...
Thank you.
Really, it will be more reliable with you.
Hey!
We are going too.
The weather is gradually getting better.
We can handle it.
Guys...
What was that sound?
Someone is walking there!
Ymir?
You are not in a hurry.
I've been sitting here for a long time.
I told Rainer and the others that you would come soon.
And I was waiting for you here.
I did such a stupid thing.
Where is Das?
Ymir!
Ymir!
Ymir!
Ymir!
Where is Das?
Was it season position?
You never even had a rope.
It was very high.
How did you go down so high?
Well,
You can be trusted, but first you have to make a promise.
When my secret becomes known to everyone,
make a promise that you will return the name and live with it.
Christ, I also thought that it would be better for me never to appear in this world,
that the world hated me only for what I am,
and I gave my life, making many people happier.
Since then, my heart has only one desire.
If I ever have a second chance,
then I will live only for myself.
The End
Oh, come on.
Is Emir a giant, too?
Emir, you...
This giant...
That one...
Thank you, Rayler.
Oh, it hurts! Rayler, my leg!
Rayler, stop it already!
Let go of her leg! Let go!
I'm sorry.
It's okay, you saved me.
Christ, did you know that Emir was a giant?
I had no idea.
Even though we were always together.
How? How is that possible?
That giant, Emir?
It seems that she knows some secrets of our world,
and we didn't suspect anything.
Yeah.
You think she didn't know about her powers?
Aaron was a giant, too,
but she didn't know about it until he turned into one.
But Emir is completely different,
and I think she knew it from the very beginning.
Are you saying that Emir is the enemy of all of humanity?
I'm just saying that she had that power,
and we don't know what's on her mind.
I wonder what purpose Emir has.
Emir!
Is that her?
Why?
Is she afraid that the tower is going to collapse?
I guess so.
If she wanted to,
she could have run away long ago,
being in the face of a giant.
But she doesn't do that.
It's because of us.
For the sake of NASA.
Why?
Why?
Emir!
Don't you dare die, Emir!
Don't you dare die in such a place!
Hey!
Don't think you're a hero, fool!
Do you want to die?
I don't want to die!
I don't want to die!
I don't want to die!
I don't want to die!
I don't want to die!
I don't want to die!
Emir!
Do you want to die swimming in the rays of glory?
You've gone too far!
Who cares?
It's too late for you to go to heaven and knock yourself out!
Live for yourself, fool!
If you're going to die for this tower,
forget about it!
Spread it out!
Hey!
Hey!
Efren decided to blow it up!
Hold on, Emir!
Do you want to live?
Hold on!
There's the threats!
What is it, man?
It's a black hole.
I've got to get up there and kill it.
Emyr!
Bad news.
Emyr!
No!
It can't be!
Christa!
How can this be?
Wait, Emyr!
I haven't...
I haven't told you everything yet!
After all, I still haven't told you my...
my real name!
Wait!
I still...
Christa!
Guys, step aside!
The rest...
is up to us!
Mikasa!
The rest will attack the giants together with their group!
Yes, ma'am!
Hey!
I told you not to stand out!
Die!
It worked!
My first kill!
Baklan!
I told you not to stand out, Eren!
Yes, sir!
I'm sorry!
Hey!
Eren!
Guys!
THE END
Seriously?
Emyr too?
Emyr!
I didn't say my name.
My name is Historia.

Not a single Bresha was found along the Rose Wall.
Then how did the giants appear inside the perimeter?
In confusion, the Legion decides to return to the Throst,
not understanding what happened after all.
However, at that moment,
Eren learns a shocking truth
that changes absolutely everything.
Next time...
War!
