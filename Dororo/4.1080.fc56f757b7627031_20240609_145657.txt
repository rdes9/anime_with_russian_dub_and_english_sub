Look, I can go faster!
But I still wanted to dance
So much that I couldn't sleep
Someday, the day of passion will come
Someday
I notice it from the nose
Someday the fireflies will disappear
Hey, I shouldn't have needed anything
But I'm still I'm so serious
Oh, I'm still in time
I'm still in time
Baby, sorry, darling, it's not that sweet
But it's not that bad
Ah, give me fire
Light it up, baby, let's burn it up, baby
Baby, sorry, darling, it's not that sweet
But it's not that bad
Ah, give me fire
Light it up, baby, let's burn it up, baby
Baby, sorry, darling, it's not that sweet
But it's not that bad
Ah, give me fire
Light it up, baby, let's burn it up, baby
I was counting on you
The story of the cursed sword
Um, excuse me
Don't waste your time
He still can't hear anything
He's completely deaf
It'll be half an hour soon, the way he stands there
He's all wet
I won't be surprised if he gets cold
Rain
I thought he was listening to the rain
Oh, I told you, he's deaf
It's just a feeling
Hey, aren't you one of the rich?
The manner of speech and well-groomed face
You don't look like a villager
Do you think I'm wrong?
Well, it was what it was
And now I'm a simple merchant
Okay, better tell me
What did you just pray about?
Good luck in the trade
I prayed that my brother would return home as soon as possible
Where did he go?
To war
It's been five years
Five years?
If he still hasn't returned, then probably already
Good luck
What's wrong with him?
Hey, where are you going?
Boys!
Where did you go?
What is this?
Who could do this?
Hey, where did you come from?
It's none of your business
Damn it, why did you do this?
This sword was thirsty for blood
And I gave it to him
The sword was thirsty for blood?
What nonsense
This is not an ordinary sword
This is a living sword, cursed to drink human blood
You should take it in your hands
And he will make you go and kill the living
Are you to blame for all this sword?
Then answer why
You deserve this
You are the same as me
The demon lives in your blade too
But mine is faster
Hey, Hyakkimaru!
Did you beat him?
He fell down
I think he...
Huh?
Your sword is broken
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
Your foot is there
I'll bring it
So, where is it?
Found it
And the sword stuck
It's creepy
We need to throw it away
Boys!
Where are you?
Manny!
Brother!
Brother!
I'm so glad you're back
Listen
Yes, I'm here
I've been praying for you for so long
For you to come home alive
And they heard
Something's wrong
Did you lose something?
No
Nothing
He'll come back to me soon
Damn it! I don't want to go there!
Let me go!
You stupid sword!
Boy, what are you doing here?
Come on, run home
It's very dangerous in these forests
Ghost killer!
I won't give it to you!
Brother!
I'm sorry, Osushi
Go to fight for samurai's debt
Please understand
I'm absolutely sure
My father and mother will look after us
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'll be back soon
My brother!
Brother
Look what I bought
Rice with chestnuts
You've always loved it, haven't you?
Do you remember when I was little
And I started crying
I couldn't stop
No matter how much my mother tried to calm me
I didn't stop
At such moments
You came to me
And put the cork
And then I stopped crying
And sat looking at the cork
I'm here
Right here
He's here!
Ghost killer!
Yukimaru!
Let's go back home, brother
Let's go back together
Please answer me
What happened to you?
Why?
Why did you become like this?
Kill him!
Right now!
Cut his head off, Tanosuke!
He built a really beautiful castle for me
Even with a huge army
It will be difficult to take him
But
If he betrays
He will tell the enemy about the vulnerable places
And then he will be able to take anyone
Kill him so as not to allow this
Please
Think again, sir
What?
Do you want to obey the order?
Then
Finish this sword with you
This old sword has been talking for a long time
Stupid and rusty
It's just right for you
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
No
No
No
Your sword
It came fromce
Here
That's it.
No way.
So who is your name?
Sir, he wants more blood.
No way.
You want more blood?
Don't worry, I'll give you more.
As much as you want.
He's here.
Don't go!
Brother!
Idiot, stop!
It's me, can't you see?
Damn!
Let me go, Osushi.
Please, brother!
Please, don't go!
Let me go!
Brother!
Get out of the way!
It's all changed.
I couldn't protect my house or my land.
So many people died.
I couldn't protect my house or my land.
So many people died.
But now that you're back,
we could live like we used to.
Please, stay with me.
Even if you're not what I used to be.
Brother!
Brother!
Nishiro is calling me.
Brother!
Brother!
Brother!
Hyakkimaru, you...
Thank you, Hyakkimaru.
Thank you.
This sword belongs to me.
To me and only to me.
Why didn't you finish me?
You should have killed me.
Before Nishiro comes back to me.
Hyakkimaru!
Brother!
Stop!
Stop!
Please!
Don't kill my brother!
Brother!
Brother!
Brother!
Brother!
Brother!
We went through everything around,
but there was no sign of the baby,
as if it fell through the ground.
There are no traces of the baby either.
