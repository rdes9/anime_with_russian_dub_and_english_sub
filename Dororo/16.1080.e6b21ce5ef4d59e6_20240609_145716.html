Hello.
Hello.
Long time no see.
And the car?
I've been looking all over for you.
There.
And now come on, show the other half what you have.
This is a map.
Listen to me, Dororo.
Remember everything well.
The goal of your father's whole life is depicted here.
Keep it and protect it.
Where did you get this?
Itachi!
I know you have a similar drawing on your back.
Come on.
Don't touch me.
Do you want to look at my back?
Okay.
That's it.
There's no map there.
Commander.
If it's not on his back, then it's probably in his head.
Except for him, we don't have anything.
Move him.
Damn it, you took me.
Let me go.
Listen, you'll pay for this.
When the brothers come, you won't see much.
Idiots.
So you don't get stuck, huh?
Aniki.
Anilibria.tv presents...
Dororo.
Dororo.
Dororo.
Series 16.
The story of Shiranui.
The story of Shiranui.
We're almost there.
Itachi.
You'd better sleep.
I have a job for you for tomorrow.
You'll fill me the second part of the map.
So, where are you going?
Right.
The place where old Hibukuro hid the money.
Why are you so surprised?
I suspected it when I was under his control.
The goods that we stole from the samurai,
they disappeared anyway.
Anything that cost at least some money.
Then I thought,
maybe the thief was the commander himself all this time.
I began to look for him,
but I didn't see him.
I didn't see him.
I didn't see him.
I didn't see him.
I didn't see him.
I didn't see him.
I didn't see him.
I didn't see him.
I didn't see him.
I began to look for him,
waiting for him to get caught.
Yes, I owe him.
He never got caught.
After some time I left this idea.
I decided that it was some kind of paranoia
and stopped thinking about it.
Then why?
When I began to desperately need money,
I remembered that again.
The commander died a long time ago,
and the two of you were the only ones who could know something.
I went to the temple where we saw each other for the last time.
Really?
Yes.
I dug up her grave.
And when I got there,
I saw this map on my back.
How did you...
How did you...
How did you kill my mom?
Bastard!
Damn you!
Dead men are useless anyway.
Emotions don't bring money.
DORORO
Dororo, do you see that Mesa?
This is Mesa Hakotsu,
the place where your dad hid the money.
Now it's all about you.
I'll share it with you if you help me.
Don't you need money?
You can eat as much food as you want.
I'm not interested at all.
Your stomach says otherwise.
It's not me.
It's normal.
It's all your fault.
You want to keep it?
Commander, how are we going to get there?
Listen, we need boats to cross the river.
It's...
Looks like the robbers have passed here.
I think so.
It looks like the robbers have passed here.
Commander!
Boats!
They are all broken.
And so on.
What are we going to do?
Do you need boats?
I can give it to you.
Where do you need it?
Over there.
Good.
But it will cost money.
Is this money here?
What happened to the others?
All are dead.
The victims of the robbers.
Something's wrong here.
Let's not do it.
I'll pay when we get there.
Okay, let's go.
Itachi!
There are no other boats.
I'll kill him if you try to throw something.
Come on, get on the boat.
Itachi!
Itachi!
Itachi!
Itachi!
Itachi!
Itachi!
Itachi!
Itachi!
Itachi!
What's going on?
What's that?
A shark!
They're dragging the boat!
Jiromaru and Saburomaru.
Did you give them the wine?
Of course.
They're my family.
A shark is your family?
Yeah.
Just look at how strong they are.
You're crazy.
What?
Interesting.
Oh, yeah.
I fed them.
Jiromaru and Saburomaru.
Huh?
Poor people were so hungry back then.
You fed them your own hand?
You're definitely out of your mind.
I don't feel sorry for them.
They mean everything to me.
Oh, since they tried the human thing,
they don't eat anything else.
First, I fed them dead people.
Then I wanted to give them something fresh.
I began to kidnap and feed them women and children.
The more they ate, the more they grew.
Now they can eat the whole village.
The whole village?
Just don't say it.
Yeah, I lied about the robbers.
I fed them all to my kids.
Grandpa.
We're going in the wrong direction.
Finally, you noticed.
What a fool.
Turn the boat around now.
Jiromaru, Saburomaru, are you hungry?
It's time to eat.
Let's go.
Come on, Jir!
Let's go!
Help!
What are we going to do?
Let's go.
It's time to eat.
Let's go.
I'm hungry.
Eat them all at once. Let them stay for later.
Saburo Maru, look after them. You can eat them after sunset.
She won't let us go.
It seems that this is the end of the story of the great Itachi.
To run away from the samurai just to be eaten by the sharks.
Samurai?
Yes, Itachi. You said that it's good to be eaten by the sharks.
Yes, it's good. I went to the war at his order.
I'm from Kozhe. I'm going to the forest to fight off some land.
Damn it! When is the reinforcements coming?
Reinforcements? Is it close already?
I don't know.
Why?
They all went to the attack on the command post.
We were just a bait. We were sent here to die.
The commander was right. We are not even people for them.
I got in touch with the samurai, waiting for trouble.
So I left them and became a robber again.
So that's why?
Yes. Your father went through a lot to hide them.
There must be a whole state there.
I could do so much with this money.
But now it's an inexhaustible dream.
It would be better if I never dug your mother's grave.
I'm sorry for this, Dororo.
What are you doing?
Does it hurt? If it hurts, it means you're alive.
That's why don't act like you're dead.
I'm not dead.
I'm alive.
You're alive.
That's why don't act like you're dead.
You know, I had to survive alone, without my father and mother.
I've been through so much. I almost died several times.
But I never gave up and didn't even complain.
I didn't pay attention to the poor and did what was possible.
Don't let go of your head. Just look forward.
If we don't get rid of the robbers, we'll be fighting for the last breath.
You're talking like your father.
All right, you've all heard the little bastard.
If you're a man, get up and fight for your life.
If you let go, you won't get the shark.
I'll kill myself.
Commander, what shall we do?
What shall we do, Dororo?
I'll lure her into a dive.
Take me out when I give a signal.
The shark will try to catch me and jump out.
And then you'll all hit her.
What shall we do? I'm counting on you.
Dororo! What are you doing?
It's time to pull. Everyone in the hall!
I got you!
Now!
Let's go!
Let's go!
She's dead.
We did it!
We did it!
It's not over yet.
That guy will be back soon.
We have to swim to the Cape before sunset.
Listen, everyone!
We have to tear the seats off and use them as sails.
We'll swim like the damned!
What's going on?
Saburamaru!
Saburamaru!
Saburamaru!
It's over.
That guy is back.
Damn it!
Damn it!
You had an advantage.
Now we're on the land.
Okay, enough.
How can you kill him?
I lost half of my men because of him.
I don't want to kill him again.
So what?
Okay.
Throw him somewhere.
Now it's time for you to split up too.
What are you looking at?
Tell me where the money is.
I don't think I told you to leave this idea.
I told you. I don't know.
It's a huge state.
It's just waiting for it to be taken.
Don't you want it?
What's on your back can move people and change the world.
It's a source of great power.
I don't need it now.
Then you'll have to make me talk.
I won't let it all end.
I want one more chance at life.
You saw it.
Don't you have anything on your back?
I don't have anything on my back.
Maybe there's something else.
No!
No!
Yes.
So that's the case.
I wonder why the commander is growing like a boy.
Damn it!
Dororo, I'm on your back.
Hold her back to the fire!
Stop!
Don't look!
So that's how you hid her, Dororo.
Follow me, guys!
Damn it!
Come back!
They're so expensive.
Money for dad.
What's that sound?
Jiro Maro.
Jiro Maro.
Maro.
Saburo Maro.
Did you see that?
It was so much fun.
These bastards.
I'll kill them all.
Jiro Maro!
Burn them all!

DORORO
DORORO
Excuse me, sir.
Is it difficult for you to walk
without one leg?
I know one person
who walks in a circle
and gives prostheses to those
who need them.
It seems that his will...
is null.
Jiromaru. Next.
