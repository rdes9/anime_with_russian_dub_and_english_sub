Let me go! Let me go!
Where are you taking me?
Damn it! Brother!

Episode 22.
The story of Nui.
What a bad luck! I almost got to Daigo Castle.
What? Are you stuck here too?
If you leave the country, it's better to hurry.
It's better for you to get off the plane while you can.
What about me? I'm going to make good money on all this.
I have a business here too.
Yeah? The war will start soon. What are you doing here?
I'm interested in myself.
Brother! Let me go!
What?
Let me go! You freaks! Let me go!
Bastards!
Damn it! I almost got scared.
Doror!
I'll get you back!
The enemy has attacked 30 of the Sakurov's troops, but they didn't fight back.
It looks like they're checking our defense.
The main forces have crossed the pass of this bitch and will be here in a day or two.
I'll stop them here.
We won't let them take a single step to our land.
Sir, can you get up already?
Maybe you'll rest a little more?
I just have a scratch. You two got a lot more.
Yeah.
I'm fine. It's true.
My sisters didn't get as much as I did.
I see.
I'm sorry.
My sisters didn't get as much as I did.
I see.
Where is she, by the way?
Isn't she with you?
No. And nobody tells me why.
The doctor should know.
Sir, please wait.
You fool!
Why did you go to fight with us?
Why didn't you rest?
You should have told me.
If only I knew.
You wouldn't have been wounded then.
I'm going in.
You can't, sir. Get out of the way.
No.
And if you also catch this virus, you can't let it go.
You're right, Yogo.
I'm sorry, sir.
It's a disease.
And now it's too early.
Now I can't be a witness to the fulfillment of your dream.
The prosperity of the country, which will one day come to you.
I know that you will definitely achieve this.
I sincerely believe in it.
Yogo, you still have your right hand.
Yes.
Good.
Protect the gentleman until his last breath.
And for all the strength you have.
I will avenge you.
Everything you tried to protect the price of your life.
I will protect.
I promise you.
What is it?
Knife.
It's useless.
Brother.
Please, brother.
Stay with the same brothers.
You?
Now everyone is busy preparing for the war.
This is your chance.
Shame on you that in the end it was he who protected you.
There is a secret passage at the end.
Through it you can escape.
Are you sure?
I will no longer allow children to be sacrificed for our protection.
How long have you been traveling with my son, Hikimaru?
It shouldn't have been easy for you.
With a small child like you.
You won't tell me about him.
Isn't it too late for that now?
Have you forgotten what you told him?
He was abandoned by his mother.
And with such words.
No eyes, no ears, no hands, no legs, nothing.
But he still tries so hard to get everything back to you.
What did the brother deserve to go through all this?
Bad thing.
I see the rain is over.
We didn't expect to see you here.
The heavy rain has passed Bon-Bon with the country.
Don't worry.
The gentleman will soon win and come back to you.
Serve your master with dignity.
You can go.
That's all. They are gone.
Mom.
Let's hurry.
Is he going to die?
I chose the direction of Daigo with her residents instead of Hikimaru.
I will never be able to cancel this choice.
I don't regret what I did as the wife of the ruler.
Do you really think so?
Mrs. Mutsu.
I brought food and medicine.
Mrs. Mutsu.
Mrs. Mutsu.
What happened?
Where did he go?
Now we need to be more careful.
Tell me.
Thank you.
When I heard that he was with the child,
I felt that I owe you a lot.
It's nothing like that.
That's right.
It's nothing like that.
If I tell my brother that it was you who helped me escape.
Well...
Okay, I'll go.
Sir, my sister has escaped.
Let's go.
Mom, brother.
I'll go too.
I wonder how it is in Banmoni.
I would like to get there too and become famous.
What?
What's that?
It's...
a monster!
Son!
Where are you?
Son!
Mrs. Mutsu!
Son!
My child!
You suddenly decided to come with me.
Are you sure?
I don't think my brother will forgive you.
Maybe he will even...
If he decides to kill me,
then this will be the path I have to take.
It seems that I finally understood something.
I wanted to see him again.
Once again.
When I see him,
I'll understand what I have to do.
The river has slowed down!
It must be because of the rain!
Water comes here from the mountains!
Damn it!
Stop it!
We'll fall apart!
Sir!
The man the guard saw was my sister!
Hurry!
Stop it!
Don't eat me!
I'm not tasty!
Stop it!
The horse!
Look!
You should have woken up!
You should have woken up!
You should have woken up!
Mother!
You're lucky!
You're still young!
When I threw you to the shore,
the locals found you.
Where am I?
Tell me,
where is the woman who was with me?
Yes, I know, but...
Hey, Ahiko!
Dororo has woken up.
Finally!
Is everything okay?
Yes.
And this...
Why?
When we told her about the local patients,
she...
wanted to help.
We just don't have enough hands.
We're lucky with her.
Listen,
she doesn't look like
Mrs. Daigo, does she?
What are you saying?
It's true.
Everyone gathered here
who had nowhere to go.
Someone had everything for military purposes.
Someone's village was burned
because of the epidemic.
We have nowhere to go,
so we're just trying to stay together.
It's all because of Daigo.
It's not because
he's some kind of a villain.
He's doing what he says
will save his country.
You're saying it
as if you know everything.
I would have said
as much as I could.
I know.
But
because I'm just sitting here,
I feel awful.
We are always
thrown off by samurai.
I can't stand it anymore.
There you go.
They told me
you lost your mother too.
Don't be sad.
Okay?
To sail along the river
together with Mrs. Daigo
is a great thing.
What are you going to do now?
I
am still thinking.
I'm fine.
You don't have to
need a mother to live.
We'll have to wait
for some time here.
The castles are worse.
I can imagine
when my son was born.
I remember
I heard him scream.
And right after
the white lightning struck.
When the vision came back
he was already...
I felt
in my hands
my most precious treasure.
A brother can turn
into a demon
if you don't stop him.
He has a hellish flame
that gets stronger and stronger.
But I can't do anything
about it.
No!
Maybe...
It's Daigo!
Daigo's army is coming!
What's going on?
I've never seen anything like it.
It's huge
and ready for war.
The army is just passing
by two pines.
All the soldiers
who were left behind
joined it.
By two pines?
Are you talking about the ones
on the northern peaks?
Do you have an enemy
other than Asakura?
I'm scared.
Scared?
They say the demon is coming.
The demon...
Don't back down! Attack!
Don't let him get to the castle!
Let's go!
The 12th demon.
The one
who couldn't swallow
Heikimaru.
You were denied
what was yours.
Take it
instead of me!
I'll give you
my whole body.
Please,
protect our country
and its people!
Mutsu!
Sister!
Don't come any closer!
You can't touch me, sir!
You want to end the deal
with the demons?
That's not what I wanted!
Maybe I can't fight
with you, but my soul
will be with you and Hyogo!
For the sake of the people!
Sister!
What happened, Mutsu?
Sister!
The deal between Daigo Kagemitsu
and the demons
may be
fulfilled.
Hyakimaru,
Daigo's heir!
Hyakimaru!
Maybe he's not his brother.
Even if he
was just following Daigo's path
and not...
Do you remember
the moment when he was born?
Yes.
Can you tell him
about it, too?
So that he knows
that his mother
means a lot to him.
Tell him, will you?
I will!
I will!
Tell him!
I will!
This belongs to me!
Hyakkimaru!
To complete the contract and ensure Daigo's prosperity,
I will take your body, Hyakkimaru!
