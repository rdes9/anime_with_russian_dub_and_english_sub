Episode 1
Does it hurt a lot?
I'm pissed that it's come to this.
That I can't do what I wanted.
But the money I collected from those samurai,
I can't lose it.
They will need to be able to survive the defenseless peasants,
to help them hold on.
I want you to help Dororo understand everything.
For what we continue our struggle.
Yes.
The money is hidden behind the North Cape, not far from here.
Wait.
Better don't tell me that, otherwise I can't hold on.
I'll spend it not for some great cause, but for one Dororo.
The path is sealed here.
Then I won't be able to see anything.
Let me have half of your wish.
And the other half?

I call her Mr.

Have you ever been in Nobel?
Yes
I have
Friends in the US

I had no idea that this thing was on my back.
I see.
I can see a heavy knife that your parents stabbed you with.
Not long before my mother died.
Listen to me, Dororo.
Remember everything.
This is the goal of your father's life.
Protect it.
Protect it.
She said that the second half will always be with me.
That I will understand where she is when I meet a person that I can really trust.
I see.
Although I didn't really understand what she meant.
I almost forgot about it.
It's great for you, of course.
All roads are open to you now.
Suppose you defeat all demons and return his body back.
But what's next?
Money is a great thing.
When your body is full, your heart is warm and calm.
You begin to look around.
And think about the future.
Hold on to your goals.
When it comes to life and death,
it's not something that love could easily do.
Even if you defeat three other demons,
the world won't change much.
But...
What's on your back can move people and change the world.
It's the source of great power.
In short, you have a big choice now.
You can find money to live by singing,
you can start a new country,
or start a journey into some unknown place.
Hey, wait!
Think about it.
Of course, if you don't want to destroy the country of Daigo
in exchange for your own body, just in case.
What are you saying? He's not like that.
Listen, brother,
haven't you decided what you're going to do next?
Defeat demons?
No, I'm talking about what the monk said.
When you defeat all demons and get your body back.
What after that?
What do you think I should do?
I don't know.
Hey, brother!
Hey!
As if you're going to die if you talk to me at least once!
Wait!
Hey!
Please, buy it.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
It was a coffin from your side.
Please, buy it.
I beg you.
It's gone!
What is it?
Brother, what is it?
It's not a demon.
Eat it! Eat it!
Play with it! Play with it!
You're going to break me!
Play with it!
Brother, help me!
Play with it!
It's not a demon.
But it's a monster!
Help me!
Brother!
Play with it! Play with it!
How can I play with you if you drag me?
Brother, give me your hand!
Eat it! Eat it!
Eat it!
Damn!
Now I wanted to eat it myself.
Brother, it's a temple.
Everything is burnt here.
At least it will be dry here at night.
What is it?
I want to pee.
Wait.
I can't take you to the toilet.
I want to pee.
No, I didn't sign up for it.
I want to pee.
You better do it yourself.
I want to pee.
Enough! Get off me!
Brother, what is it?
I was able to take it to the bushes.
What?
Oil?
But why is there oil here?
Do you think someone set this place on fire on purpose?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Who set this place on fire?
Eat it!
Eat it!
I almost got scared because of you.
Come on, not now.
Eat it!
I don't even know what you're eating.
We don't have enough food for ourselves.
And here we have to feed the monsters.
Wait, don't you want to eat it?
Eat it!
No, don't eat me!
I'm not hungry at all!
Eat it!
Save me, brother!
I didn't expect to meet strangers here.
It's very curious to know who you are.
Maybe you don't know, but it's very dangerous here at night.
The demons loved this place.
Demons?
If you want, you can stay at my place.
I don't want to hear the news about someone being eaten in my mountain village.
Brother!
I'm the ruler of these lands.
My name is Sabato.
I'm the leader of these lands.
I'd like to hear about your travels.
Listen, he's not a monster, is he?
I'm not sure.
Good evening, Mr. Sabato.
You're still on duty? You're so hardworking.
You shouldn't.
I'm just looking after my village.
We live peacefully only thanks to you, sir.
That's true.
Where did that monstrous child go?
My house is here.
Please come in.
Listen to what is taking place here.
This is our old folk dance. Do you like it?
Add more.
Thank you.
You're a good man after all.
If you feed strangers like us so well.
I like to listen to stories about their travels.
I've just never left my land myself.
Really?
Then I'm sure you have something interesting to tell.
For example, about the demons in the burned temple.
What?
It's not the most pleasant story.
Once upon a time there was a women's monastery in that place.
The sister there gathered orphans from all the nearby villages.
They were forced to work like cattle, if they didn't obey.
After a few years they were sold.
It's worse that even the gods got tired of it.
One night the monastery was struck by lightning.
The fire spread and in a few minutes everything burned.
There was nothing left of the children or the monks.
That's terrible. Are all the children?
We're sorry that we couldn't do anything earlier.
It's too late to be sorry.
But we pray for their poor souls.
The demon is the ghost of that nun.
Apparently her path to heaven is now closed.
She appears at night and eats those who pass by.
We're lucky that we didn't get caught.
It's all thanks to you.
Well, it's not worth it.
Well, it's late.
You can stay here and rest as much as you want.
What do you think, brother? Is it true what he said?
I don't think about the demon.
Perhaps. And about the fact that the monastery was struck by lightning.
Those traces of oil mean that a person set it on fire.
We'll find out in time.
Do you think the demon will come here?
It's not that I'm scared.
But it's pretty cool here.
I think it's from the well.
Brother, are you asleep?
What's on your back can move people and change the world.
It's the source of great power.
Listen, brother.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I don't know what you're talking about.
To adhere to the goal when it comes to life and death
is not something that anyone could do with ease.
Don't blame me.
I don't blame you.
I don't blame you.
I don't blame you.
I don't blame you.
I don't blame you.
I don't blame you.
I don't blame you.
Go.
I don't blame you.
I don't blame you.
Go.
Don't blame me.
I haven't done anything wrong.
Don't blame me.
I am alone this whole time.
Brother, there's something over there!
Brother, wake up!
Hurry!
Brother!
Stay back!
Is he spitting?
Hey!
You won, brother!
What?
What?
What the...
What is it?
Did you take your shoes?
I was so scared!
This time it's some huge butterfly monster.
Brother, my skin is itching because of this powder.
Isn't it poison?
I need to wash it.
There's a wire over there.
Listen, brother.
After all, it's a big thing.
Gena...
He took that huge caterpillar with him.
Do you think he decided to save his Chada?
Mr. Sabame...
I finally found the food you need.
Even two.
I'm sure the children will be happy.
They couldn't eat.
He's too strong.
You were defeated!
The one who couldn't eat the twelfth...
He came for what he was taken away.
I won't let anyone and nothing harm you or the children.
For the sake of my land and for the sake of my people.
