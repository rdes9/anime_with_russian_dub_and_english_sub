        <pre>It's Noko-Sarigumo!
Faster!
We need to prepare the bride!
The black cloud had no name.
It was alone in the sky, leaving the earth behind.
That's why people called it Noko-Sarigumo.

Episode 8
Saru's Story
It stinks.
It smells like rotten eggs.
Are you okay?
Do you smell anything?
Why do I always say only one thing?
You got your voice back!
Okay, let's try talking.
Come on, brother, tell me something.
Oh, a wedding ceremony?
Only...
What are they doing here?
Hey, wait a minute!
Get out of the way!
I won't let you destroy the honor of the young with your arrows.
Why do you need this?
The honor of the young?
Do you think this is what the sister is waiting for after the wedding with the monster?
The wedding with the monster?
I have to stop them!
Get out of the way, or you'll get it too!
Come on, slow down.
You'd better tell me everything in order.
We've had to deal with monsters a couple of times already.
What are you talking about?
There it is.
The cloud is hanging right on the village.
Is that a monster?
Yes.
The sister told me.
People call it Nukosarigumo.
Since a long time ago, it appears here and there and devours people.
It's the only thing that can stop it.
It's the only thing that can stop it.
It's the only thing that can stop it.
It's the only thing that can stop it.
Once people decided to give it a bride in the hope that it would not touch others.
And it really left without killing anyone.
Since then, every time it comes, they give it a bride.
Because if you don't do it, it will get angry and eat everyone in the village.
It's a monster, but it wants a human bride.
And there are many different ones.
The sister thinks that it has eaten them all.
I don't understand monsters in life.
And this time they chose your sister?
I have to save her.
I don't want the monster to eat her.
I think we can help you.
The brother has already beaten a bunch of different monsters.
And he will also be able to beat him.
Really?
Yes.
But not for nothing.
He won't take it without a reward.
It's delicious.
But not this one.
You need something valuable in money.
It's gold.
I found it in the river.
I have a lot of them.
Take as much as you want.
Really?
Well, then we agreed.
My name is Dororo.
And I'm Saru.
Saru?
Like a monkey?
Strange name.
Dororo is strange.
That's right.
It's a good name.
I admit that it's good.
No.
Sister!
Sister!
I asked you so many times not to come.
I came to save you.
I can't go with you.
Why?
Really?
For the sake of the village?
Forget about them.
They use you to save themselves.
It's not like that.
I decided to do it myself.
I don't want the monsters to eat them all.
And you too.
I don't want you to die.
Please go.
Hey, relax.
We'll handle this monster for you.
And there will be no problems.
You?
But how are you going to do it?
If he eats people, then he has a sore stomach.
We'll take care of them.
See?
Brother is ready for battle.
No.
It's already here.
What is it?
We have to run away from here.
Quiet.
It will hear you.
Brother!
Over there!
Do you hear me?
Why are you standing?
In front of Hekimaru's eyes there was a solid wall of an evil flame.
The dark cloud was a part of the body of this terrible demon.
Hekimaru was surrounded by a burning wall.
For the first time in his life he was completely blind.
Sister!
This is a four-legged creature.
It's huge.
Brother!
He's going to hit us!
He's going to hit us!
We're saved!
We're saved!
Do you live here?
Yes.
I live here alone.
Alone?
Sister is not my own sister.
I lived alone all my life.
Dad and Mom died when I was very little.
But I made it.
At least I have a mountain left.
I hate people.
They said it wasn't my mountain and chased me away.
Get away from me!
Are you hurt?
Let me see.
Are you the boy who lives on the mountain?
You're like a monkey, Saru.
What's your name?
I'm Hekimaru.
What's your name?
I'm Hekimaru.
What's your name?
I'm Saru.
What's your name?
My name?
Don't you remember your name?
Saru.
My name is Saru.
It's a strange feeling.
When I looked at it, I forgot about hunger and cold.
The only one who was kind to me was Mom.
So I thought,
maybe I should do something else.
Sister would be my mom.
Your mom?
Saru, listen.
I don't have time for tears.
I'm going to take revenge for my sister.
Is that clear?
Yes.
I've never given up halfway either.
Let's defeat him together.
Yeah.
But...
I don't know why,
but my brother couldn't fight in that cloud.
We have to deal with him together.
What about the cloud?
It's gotten even bigger.
What's that?
It's his skin.
It's bad.
It gets bigger when it's lined up.
Bigger?
Even bigger than now?
But why?
Shouldn't he have left when he got the bride?
It looks like he's angry because of us.
What should we do?
His weak sunlight.
If we can pull him out of the cloud, we'll win.
Then I have a great idea.
Let's do it, Saru.
Let's destroy him.
Yeah, for the sake of my sister.
Sister!
Sister!
Episode 4
Hey, come here!
Here!
It doesn't matter.
Come on, try to catch me.
I'm here.
Come here!
Just a little more.
That was close.
It's your turn, Saru.
It's for your sister.
Was that not enough?
Yeah.
But not enough.
Burn in the sunlight!
Seriously?
Damn it!
I can't believe it!
Damn it!
Looks like all the effort was in vain.
Brother!
He hit him!
But why did he shoot?
Hekimaru lost his sight in this wall of fire.
That's why he decided to find the monster
by the sound of the shot.
It's bad!
Yeah, the sound.
What are you going to do?
Brother, focus on my voice.
I'm on his head.
I'm on his head.
I'm on his head.
Brother, come here.
His eye is next to me.
Now you're done.
Is he on his tail?
I'm on his tail.
I'm on his tail.
Now you're done.
Is he on his tail?
I'm on his tail.
I'm on his tail.
And now you're done.
I'm on his tail.
I'm on his tail.
I'm on his tail.
Sister! Sister!
Sister!
Saru!
Yes, it's me!
I'm so glad you're alive!
Brother?
Really?
Brother?
Really?
You got your nose back!
Here! As promised!
Yeah, thanks!
And what is this?
I've collected a whole bunch of them!
But I wanted them to be gold!
Like the one I gave you at the beginning!
The shiny ones!
I only had one of those!
And what's the difference?
What do you mean?
Thanks to you, I'm alive!
What's your name?
Dororo.
Thank you, Dororo!
What are you going to do now?
We're going to live in the village.
I'm lonely, too.
I'm glad for you, Saru.
Yeah!
Yeah, and we need to come up with a new name for you.
I like Saru, too.
No, the name is very important.
You sound like a real sister!
All right.
Dororo.
This feeling, brother,
is called smelly.
Did you just say Dororo?
It's the first time he's called my name.
Brother, wait!
I have a cool name, right?
