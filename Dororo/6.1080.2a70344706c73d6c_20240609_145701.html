        <pre>Episode One
Hekkemar was wounded because of an unexpected return of the news.
A girl named Mio sheltered him.
She lived with the children who lost their parents in the war.
But that night when Hekkemar went to battle with the demon...
I can't... I can't believe it.
What is it?
Brother? Brother? What happened?
Oh, hi. You're on time. Help me get him.
Brother, are you okay?
His leg!
He shouldn't have fought with the wounded.
The demon hurt him.
Brother, it hurts a lot.
That voice...
Yes, he lost his leg, but he returned his voice.
Returned... voice?
I can't believe it.
I can't believe it.
I can't believe it.
I can't believe it.
I can't believe it.
I can't believe it.
I can't believe it.

Detail TV presents...
Dororo
The sixth episode. The story of Moriko's song. Part two.
Mio! Welcome back!
Here I am.
What are you doing? You're all bruised.
It's okay. I just fell.
Are you sure? Come on, go get some rest.
I told you, you shouldn't work at two camps at once.
Maybe you should...
What is it?
Oh, well, you know...
Hikimaru!
What happened?
There's no threat for life.
He just got into a fight too early.
Mio, leave him alone. Go get some rest.
It's okay. It's not my first time.
Guys, get the food ready.
Damn it!
Why did you run away?
Shouldn't you be with him right now?
Yeah.
But I think Mio will take good care of him.
What can I do? My sister loves to take care of everyone.
Even after the night shift.
Take. Have you ever seen how my sister works?
I'm at home all the time.
I can't leave the kids without supervision.
I see.
Listen, if we don't rely on Mio, we'll die of hunger sooner or later.
I didn't mean anything like that.
We all promised each other that one day we would have our own rice field.
Rice field?
Yeah, so that everything would be green in the summer.
And everything would be golden in the autumn.
Golden, you know?
We'll grow so much rice that we won't be able to eat it.
All the rice fields that we saw were either dried or burned in the war.
But Mio said they used to be golden.
Let's plant our own rice field one day.
Green and golden.
And only ours.
I can't wait to work more.
To make it easier for Mio's sister.
Hey!
Takki!
I'm coming!
Don't worry.
The war has taken a lot from us.
And it's time for us to get it back.
Now it's about the rain.
Don't worry.
The rain pours every year at this time.
Look.
The clouds are slowly coming together.
Please, father!
Let me take part in the sake campaign too!
I'll easily crush their pathetic forces!
Don't underestimate the war.
If that's what you think, then you're not ready yet.
Get back to training.
Father!
Tachamaru!
Mother!
Mother!
Please talk to your father!
Let him let me take part in the war!
Father already told you no.
My words won't change his decision.
Father just doesn't understand!
If only he let me!
I'm sure I'd be able to get famous in battle!
So you'd be proud of me!
Get famous?
That means you're not interested in my fame.
That's not what I meant.
You've always been such a bitch.
No matter how hard I try,
no matter how hard I try,
you don't care about it.
I just...
I just don't like anything to do with the war.
You don't like the war.
You don't like me.
What are you talking about, Tachamaru?
How can a mother not love her son?
Hyogo Mutsu, I want to get married.
Get the horses ready.
Yes, sir.
Sir!
You don't have to tell me.
I behaved a little childishly.
A little?
The lady is very kind.
She was especially kind to you.
Always.
I get it now!
Mother was always kind to me.
But...
Young master,
it's very dangerous.
You'll get hurt.
Hyogo Mutsu, help!
Mother!
Look, I'm so high!
Please, young master,
get down faster!
Young master,
please, get down from there.
Do you hear me?
Yes.
Do you hear me?
There is something in this world
that the mother thinks much more about.
She never admits it.
But she definitely hides something.
No.
And not only the mother.
And the father too.
You, me, our possession.
All this is kept on a small stone.
Don't forget about it.
What's going on?
They're silent.
Hikimaru!
You can't get up yet!
It's too early for you to walk.
I know you're upset.
But what will happen if you die?
I...
I got so confused too.
So I understand.
So stupid.
I knew it wasn't easy
to make money.
No, no.
I promised I wouldn't cry
because of the samurai anymore.
You too.
If you get exhausted and die,
you lose.
By the way,
I heard you got your voice back.
That's great.
Try to say something.
Your voice is too loud for you.
It's true.
It's true.
It's true.
You'll get used to it.
Dororo said you look like
a wild beast sitting in a log.
Do you want me to sing for you?
I know you like songs.
I always sing
when I'm sad.
So I don't cry.
Are you leaving?
You're right.
I have to be careful.
I want to walk around the log
like a monster.
I don't have anything special yet.
But talking to Hikimaru
is useless now.
Why?
If I take the toy from the kid,
he'll get mad and want to return it.
It's the same here.
Especially when the kid
has taken all his body.
When he hears this song,
he starts to cry.
What do you want to say?
The demon that touched Hikimaru
in his childhood.
You could say
that it left some coal
when it took his body.
Let's hope
that the beast that comes out
of the log
won't turn into a monster.
See you soon.
White flower
Don't look at me like that.
I was told
that you can see
human souls.
They are flowers.
Please,
don't look at mine.
I'm sure it has a dirty color.
Very.
How strange.
I don't like these hands.
Mr. Daigo is not happy.
There will be no provision.
He will send it out.
And the reinforcement too.
But it would be a real shame
to sit and wait.
We have to make a sudden attack.
But we have to make sure
that there are no spies among us.
Yes!
Are you going to work?
So you know
that I have a job.
I didn't want to look.
Honestly.
Don't worry.
I'm not ashamed of it.
It's for survival.
But I will understand
if you don't want to talk to me.
Work is not the best.
I'm surprised
that a boy of your age
is living with his mother.
In the past,
I traveled a lot with my mother.
And it was the only job
that she didn't agree to
as if we were poor and didn't live.
You have a wonderful mother.
But
then she...
Then my mother died.
Maybe my mother was wonderful.
But you lived in the end.
You!
Do you want to return
what the war took from you?
Then take everything!
Fields, farms, everything!
Okay. Thank you.
I brought something to eat.
Do you want to be stronger?
You have to eat!
Why did you lose your leg?
Your voice is back.
Say something!
Come on.
You have to eat if you want to talk.
Here, drink.
I'm sorry.
Listen.
Brother.
You won't lose to him, will you?
You won't lose to the monster,
will you?
Okay.
You still have to eat.
I'll give it
to her.
To her.
Wow!
Wow!
Wow!
Wow!
Wow!
Wow!
Wow!
Wow!
Wow!
Wow!
Wow!
Wow!
Cool!
Wow!
I'm going to work.
Make sure that Hikimaru doesn't get into the fight again.
His body is not ready for this yet.
I know.
Are you crazy?
Right in your hand!
Well, we also have something cool.
We found them on the battlefield.
Look.
Good, isn't it?
Mom.
Brother!
Finally!
What have we been waiting for?
What have we been waiting for?
Sister Mio,
trouble!
Hikimaru is going to fight the monster!
Dororo has already run after him.
What have we been waiting for?
Brother!
What have we been waiting for?
What have we been waiting for?
Damn it!
I see.
Why did you go away?
I didn't tell anyone.
Sister is worried too!
But your foot grew back.
What is?
What is it?
The temple!
Search! They may be still alive!
What is it? What's going on?
Who are you looking for?
Who is one of them?
One of them!
This girl came to our camp to entertain the boys with a lot of fun.
But last night we noticed how she went to the Sakai camp with the enemy spies, and we have a short conversation.
Mio! Take!
Let me go! How dare you!
Mio!
Now it's clear that you are also one of them!
Who are you?
His hands!
Sister! Wake up!
Take!
Sakai... my... flower...
Sister!
Kill him! Kill him!
What is it?
What the hell is that?
No! Brother!
Let's hope that the beast that once comes out of the bierlogue won't turn out to be a monster.
I beg you! Please, please, have mercy!
Wait, brother! Stop!
Don't! Don't become a monster!
Please, brother! Please!
Look! It was Mio's sister!
This is rice seeds. She really returned them to the samurai to plant her rice field.
She didn't lose!
And you can't lose either! Please!
Take this!
