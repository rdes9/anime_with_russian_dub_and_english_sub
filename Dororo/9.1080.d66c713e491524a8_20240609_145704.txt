Aren't you tired yet? You've been sniffing since the morning.
Stop it!
Something's wrong with me.

Doror
The story of mercilessness
What do you want?
Doro...ro...
Doro...ro...
body...
hot.
Are you sick?
I'm sorry, I'm just a farmer.
I don't have any medicine.
I can't help you with anything.
No worries.
The story of mercilessness
Mom...
Do you need help?
Mom...
It's okay.
You need to sleep.
We're in the temple.
Your friend brought you here.
Brother...
Brother!
You can't...
Brother!
He left me again and left.
Calm down.
He just left to get some water.
No one will leave you.
I hate chickens.
They remind me of my mom and dad.
Were they such bad parents?
No!
Not at all.
Dad and mom were strong and kind.
The story of mercilessness
Dad, will you take me with you next time?
Only if mom allows.
Those samurai got what they deserved.
Right, commander?
I think we can't lose to Daigo's army.
Right.
Who's next?
Let me think.
Come on, go to mom.
I want to listen, too.
Doroora, I'll play with you later.
Okay.
Mom!
I want to go with dad.
Okay.
I want to go with dad.
I told you, you can't.
I can fight bad people, too.
Grow up a little first, okay?
I want to go now.
I want, I want.
If you get cocky, I'll hang you on the tree again.
Who's that?
Is it Tuchoki?
Is it Bell?
I'm not playing.
What then?
I throw stones.
I don't have a sword.
That's why I will fight bad people like that.
I like your mind.
You know, Doroora,
now that you're in charge of the fight,
we're going to have a fight.
But, you know, Dorora,
there's not enough strength to live alone right now.
Bad news!
The samurai are coming!
Dorora, hide over there!
Commander!
So you've come to take revenge?
You'll pay for everything!
We're just attacking the samurai.
We're not some scumbags!
Silence!
Dorora!
Dorora!
Mom!
Mom!
Mom...
Don't worry.
Dad will always be Dad.
Yeah.
So what now?
We'll gather people and regroup.
For the sake of the dead comrades,
we can no longer escape.
Odja,
we can't stay here any longer.
I agree.
In those days,
the robbers were a disaster in every corner of the country.
Their atrocities inspired fear and horror in the hearts of the defenseless.
The samurai, who lost their masters,
joined the gangs.
The poor joined them to survive,
or for other reasons.
The Hibukuro gang consisted of farmers
and engaged only in attacking the samurai.
They were a rather rare gang of robbers.
Listen, Dad.
Why are you fighting the samurai?
To teach them a lesson.
To let them know that we are also living people.
But don't the samurai know that?
As for me,
they have already learned their lesson.
What do you want to say?
Look around you.
You have gathered a very strong gang.
Isn't it time to think about the future?
If you do everything right,
you will get a good position as a ruler.
Itachi,
have you forgotten what they did to us?
Because of the war they started,
our families died for nothing.
They burned down the villages that we built together.
I really forgot about it.
I am not one of those who cling to the past.
Now it will be better if we unite with the samurai.
Shame!
What did I say?
Say it again.
You won't get rid of me with one fist.
I understand you.
The soldiers and Nagimoto got tired after the battle with Daigo.
Now is a good chance.
Go!
No!
Mom!
It's me, Daruro!
How do you understand this, Itachi?
All this land will soon become one big battlefield, commander.
The samurai era has come.
And you won't be able to live in it if you are so stubborn.
I'm taking your people with me.
Pity cow!
I'll tear you to pieces!
No!
Now you can't even stand on your feet.
It's a pity, but you won't tear me to pieces.
The fire of Hibukuro has gone out.
And there's only a thorn left on my body.
Darling!
Itachi!
Itachi!
We need to find something to eat.
Mom!
What does this mean?
I don't know.
But maybe it would be even better there.
Let's go.
Why does the lily have the same color as the blood?
Probably because they absorbed the blood of those who died in the war.
Stop it already.
Don't scare the child.
Please don't!
We have been rebuilding this whole village for many years!
Shut up!
There should be no obstacles for the passage of our army!
As you wish, sir!
I beg you!
Where should we live then?
Hands off!
Set it on fire!
It's so cruel.
The rulers and samurai think they can afford anything for the sake of the war.
But...
Please!
Let's not!
Let's go.
Hey, you!
Stop right there!
This long weapon...
I will never forget.
The robbers attacked our houses.
And all my friends died.
I never understood...
...why I was the only one left alive.
But now I know.
Kibokoro!
Bastard!
That's how you have to hit a spear!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Mom.
I want to eat.
One day this war will end.
And then you can eat as much as you want.
You shouldn't lose to Dororo before that.
I'm sorry.
Yes?
Maybe it's none of my business.
But in the temple,
samurai give out food along the way.
Go there.
Itazachi!
What a meeting!
What are you doing here?
You know,
I'm a great paladin with a ruler.
But now I have to stand out by all means.
I'm the ruler of the temple.
I'm the ruler of the temple.
I'm the ruler of the temple.
I'm the ruler of the temple.
I'm the ruler of the temple.
I'm the ruler of the temple.
Turn the camera aroundOK?
Right now, there are a lot of thugs in the city.
That's the fastest way toimpose people.
You better make the commander look a little bit better.
Mhm.
Hey Dororo.
The race was good,
or a little bit bad.
No way Dororo.
But...
Listen to your mom.
Oh, come on.
It's almost over.
There's not enough for all of us.
Wait here, Dororo.
Give it to me, please.
Look, you don't even have a bowl.
And we're out of our own.
I can't owe you anything.
I'm sorry.
Then pour it here.
Yeah, but...
Pour it.
Okay.
Mom, are you okay?
I'm fine.
Come on, eat slowly.
It's good.
You don't want it?
Don't worry, just eat.
It's not what I wanted to see.
It's so low.
Dororo!
It's not enough to live alone.
Use what you have here.
Be mine.
If you don't want to die.
Idiot!
Mom!
Mom!
I'm fine.
Just a little rest.
Mom!
Hold on.
I'll go look for something else.
Come here, Dororo.
One day the war will end.
You shouldn't lose to her.
Mom!
Mom!
Answer me!
Mom!
I'll never say I want to eat again.
Just don't die!
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
That's why I'm never going to lose.
There's some kind of war going on.
I don't know how you feel,
but it must be hard to travel with such a little girl.
I'll pray to Buddha that he blesses you on your way.
There she said that I had been ill for three full days.
I don't remember anything from what happened back then.
Brother.
Thank you for not leaving me.
Yes, by the way, maybe you can't see her, but she also washed my clothes.
Look, it doesn't smell at all.
Wait, it turns out that they took my clothes off.
Brother, did the nun say something about me?
Did she?
Did she say something?
Hey, I know you can hear me.
Well, say something, brother.
Hey, can you hear me?
I'm actually talking to you, brother.
The nun, who used to work here, heard that the child was sent down the river without hands and legs.
Three days ago, the commander, who was pursuing the spy Asakura, was seriously wounded.
According to him, the attacker had prostheses instead of hands.

The sound of our footsteps is loud.
Did you have any desire to see the depth of your eyes?
