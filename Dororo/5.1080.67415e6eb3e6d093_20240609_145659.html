The day of passion will come one day, one day.
I can feel it from the nose.
Someday the fireflies will disappear.
I shouldn't have needed anything.
But I'm still so silly.
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.
Baby, sorry, darling, I'm not that sweet.
But I'm not that bad.
Give me fire.
Light it up, baby, I'll burn it up.
Baby, sorry, darling, I'm not that sweet.
But I'm not that bad.
Give me fire.
Light it up, baby, I'll burn it up.
Baby, sorry, darling, I'm not that sweet.
But I'm not that bad.
Give me fire.
Light it up, baby, I'll burn it up.
The fifth episode.
The story of the song of Moriko. Part one.
Brother!
Brother!
Brother!
How are you?
Is it still too loud?
But it's so quiet here that it even scares me.
Listen.
It was the most shocking feeling of all that Recovered Hekimaru.
New sounds were rolling in his head,
and he didn't know which of the thousands he should listen to.
Hekimaru drowned in this waterfall of sounds.
He didn't know which of the thousands he should listen to.
Brother, maybe we should stop after the next monster?
The reward is good, of course, but in your own way.
Is there something there?
There it is!
The monster bird is huge!
Brother, don't pay attention to the sounds!
To the left!
Brother!
The monk!
Wow! You two again!
I'm so glad to meet you!
Brother, come back!
Come!
Brother! Brother!
So that's how it is. I'm very happy for him.
There's nothing to be happy about. He became weaker after he started to hear.
Really?
I'm talking about the fact that he was beaten by a monster bird, which you cut once or twice.
Thank you for your kind words.
Everything will be fine with him, right?
The worst is already behind us.
We would give him the medicine if it was there.
I'll run away and look for him. There's a big city on the other side of the river.
I don't recommend it. I heard the war is brewing. It's dangerous.
It seems that the clan of Sakai who rules here betrayed their ally.
Look, two armies have already put up a fight.
It's like a suicide for us to appear there now.
That's why I decided to turn back and came across you.
Damn it! That's why I just want to fight.
Too loud? Sorry.
Don't move, or the wounds will open.
Here you are. You're like a wild beast that's hiding in Berlogi.
Do you hear me? It's a human voice.
And other sounds are made by animals in the forest, fire and wind.
You'll have to get used to them to get out of Berlogi and live in the big world.
Brother, it hurts. Don't make him do that.
To get used to it, he needs time.
What a pleasant voice.
It's too early for you to get up.
Here you are.
This meat is too tough.
Here you are.
Aren't you hurt? Are you okay?
Ah, so you can't see.
Here I am.
What's wrong with you? You have a fever.
You can't stand in the water. Let's go.
Hey, hold on.
Brother!
I've never seen him so weak.
If you don't count his wounds, he's already returned a lot of things to the demons.
I think he hasn't been able to get used to it yet.
I found a few old rags. They're clean.
Thank you.
I think your name is Milo. Please forgive me for all these inconveniences.
Everything is fine. Stay until he gets better.
Really?
Of course. In fact, there are a lot of people living here like your brother.
Everyone is used to it.
Guys, don't be shy. Come out and say hello.
There was a terrible war.
We lost our homes and everything we had.
And now we all live here.
So none of them have a father or a mother?
Yes, but they are all so good.
Even though they are children, they somehow cope.
Hey, Milo! Why aren't you asleep yet?
Come on, get out of here.
Milo, you should sleep while you can.
I'll look after the wounded, and you lie down.
Okay, okay.
If you need anything, ask Akeba.
Hurry up. I made breakfast, so eat before you go to bed.
Okay.
You'll find food too.
This is magai. Eat.
Oh, thank you.
You're welcome.
Do you need help?
No. I'd better look after my companions.
I'd like to pay you back for your kindness.
I'd like to work out the food you gave us.
Oh, you're a good guy.
Well, brother, brother, you shouted like a child.
I didn't shout. There was no such thing.
Be quiet!
You'll wake up Milo.
I'm sorry. By the way, why is she sleeping during the day?
Because she works at night.
The military clans of Sakai don't know exactly when the war will begin.
So they need a servant during the night too.
And they pay more for the night.
Milo's sister works so well that they give her food.
So we have to let her sleep during the day.
You know, you're a good guy too.
Are you leaving already, Mr. Monk?
Yes. I want to look for a way around the battlefield.
I won't be long.
If I don't come back, it means I've found the right path to slip.
Bye.
Okay.
Isn't he with you?
We just cross each other sometimes. He's strange.
I wonder if there will be another war.
How should we know?
We can't stay either.
Damn it!
The army of Sakai on the border hasn't come out yet.
There's a bad situation.
If it continues like this, we'll have to send supplies.
We should have enough of them.
Yes, but the rain hasn't been here for almost a month.
Such a drought is very unusual for this season.
It's better to save the supplies just in case.
There can't be any bad crops on my land.
Yes.
Why are you so sure?
My wife.
First, the problem with Sakai.
Now it's a drought.
You can still remember about that flood.
It's like we're going back to the past.
What are you talking about?
You, me, our land.
It's all kept on a small stone.
We shouldn't forget about it.
And everything can collapse one day.
To hell with Sakai!
Find out as soon as possible.
Yes.
Let's go.
Run, run, run!
True, true, true!
Run, run, run!
Guys!
Stop laughing and help me!
Hyakkimaru, how are you feeling?
I haven't slept yet.
I'll bring you some medicine tonight.
I'm sure the Sakai soldiers will find something.
Well, I have to go to work.
Brother, dinner will be ready soon.
Brother.
Animals know much more about safe roads than people.
This way, then.
Great place.
What are you doing here?
Medicine.
Yes, here it is.
I'll make it.
How strange.
You seem to be able to see me.
And you're looking straight inside.
He can see the color of the soul.
Brother, don't go any further.
I was scared.
The color of the soul?
Yes.
I don't really understand it myself.
But he can see the color of the soul of living creatures.
Not only people, but also plants, animals, trees.
It can even distinguish demons.
I don't think they have a very pleasant color.
I see.
What?
Maybe he wants to hear you sing.
Sing?
It seems to him calmer when he hears your song.
That's right.
You'll help him get used to hearing.
Because now he's like a wild animal in a den.
In fact, I'm not so good at singing.
All right.
Sarvi, the scarlet flower.
Give it to her.
Sarvi, the scarlet flower.
Give it to her.
Give it to her with soft hair.
Attach that flower to her.
Oh, Monk!
Did you find the way?
Yes, but I have both good and bad news.
Judging by the story, this is a great place.
It will be safe there even if the war starts.
I tried the soil, and it's pretty good.
Let's go there, Sister Mio.
Will we live there?
Yes.
But not so fast.
That land is already owned by someone.
But you said it was free there.
Demon.
And not from those we could easily cope with.
Always so.
So there's some kind of monster there?
Yes, but he's much stronger than an ordinary monster.
I see.
Hey, wait.
You don't want to go there now, do you?
Wait, you haven't recovered yet.
Monk!
Of course I said I knew you were going to go there.
But I thought you'd at least wait for the wounds to heal.
You just can't wait, can you?
Take care of him, Monk!
I should try too.
You really should look after him.
Do you want to work on the enemies too?
Do you want to work on two sides at once?
Yes, starting tomorrow.
That's too dangerous.
Exactly.
It's so hard for you.
But we have to be ready for the move.
We're going to need a lot of money.
Of course, but...
Don't worry.
The war has taken a lot from us.
And it's time for us to get it back.
Sister Mio.
Okay, while we have time, I have to rest.
Good night.
Bye.
If she wants to, she'll be so stubborn.
I heard the enemies are very rude.
I know.
I'll go with her.
You?
Then I'll go too.
No, no.
You should stay with the others.
Don't worry.
If they bend the stick, I'll get it back.
Okay.
Thank you.
It's time for us to get it back, then.
I like it.
And we'll take the samurai back, too.
How long are we going to sit here?
I'll never be famous like this.
I agree.
We're definitely not going anywhere.
Gentlemen.
I'm looking for a job.
Where did Sister Mio go?
Do you see him?
Are you sure?
You should wait until he turns off.
I think I've found it.
Now!
What the hell is that?
Hyakkimaru!
Hyakkimaru!
Your voice!
Hyakkimaru!
Hyakkimaru!
Hyakkimaru!
Hyakkimaru!
Hyakkimaru!
Hyakkimaru!
Hyakkimaru!
Hyakkimaru!
Hyakkimaru!
Hyakkimaru!
Hyakkimaru!
Hyakkimaru!
Hyakkimaru!
Hyakkimaru!
Hyakkimaru!
Hyakkimaru!
