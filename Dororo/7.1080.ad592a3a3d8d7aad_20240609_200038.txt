Episode Two
Let's hope that the beast that once comes out of the bierlogue won't turn out to be a monster.
Hey, brother, aren't you hungry?
Looks like he's not hungry now.
Looks like you've never laughed before.
Well, if you don't want to, don't do it.
Don't come back to her. I want to stay with you forever.
Me too.
Don't you want to stay there?
The bear will eat you. Take it, take it.
What the...
What?
Hey, are you okay?
What's wrong with him? Is he mad?
Well done!
Come out!
Damn!
She ran away.
Oh, look, there's a village.
I have to go.
I have to go there to replenish my strength.
I've noticed from the nose that the village will disappear one day.
Hey, I shouldn't have needed anything, but I'm still...

Episode 7. The story of the spider Jorogumo.
My body is so weak that I can't even get up.
How is everything going here?
We set up guards to protect the village.
Protect? From what?
We have an unknown kidnapper here.
Kidnapper?
Yes. The villagers began to disappear at night.
We set up people to keep an eye on the area.
Tell us if you notice anything.
Listen, brother.
I'm sure that the spider just kidnapped all the people.
They have a problem with that.
We could help them out.
We'll probably get a reward.
I have to get there.
Hey, girl! Are you okay?
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.
What's wrong with you?
You look pale.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.
You look pale.
Let's go home.
I'll give you something to eat.
Can you go?
I can.
Okay. Let's go.
I'll drink his life force first.
What's your name?
My name is Yadzher.
I don't have a name.
You don't?
Well, you do.
Done.
What about you, Huggie?
Oh, Huggie.
You were lying among the flowers of Huggie.
Call me whatever you want.
Okay, Huggie.
You must be hungry.
Here.
What is this?
It looks disgusting.
Try it.
It's good.
Where did you come from, Huggie?
If it's not a secret.
It's none of your business.
Why were you lying there?
As if I wanted it.
If I had the strength, I would have left right away.
Why aren't you eating?
I...
I ate just before we met.
What's that sound?
It doesn't matter. Eat faster.
I have to go to work.
I'll be back in the evening.
Eat and go to bed.
What a weird man.
It's my food. Don't touch it.
It's not a forest plantation.
Will we be able to find food in this village?
What's that?
Listen, friend.
What does it say?
It says that he was awarded for catching the kidnapper.
It seems that this will somehow help him catch him.
See? I was right.
This award will be ours.
Do you know who the kidnapper is?
Are you also behind the award?
I wouldn't be in your place.
It's definitely the work of a monster.
Monster?
Calm down, calm down.
Don't stop.
Keep working.
I think the monster goes hunting
when it gets dark.
We still don't have enough strength to find it during the day.
We need to be smarter.
Well, let's go, brother.
This is all I can eat with human food.
I'm sorry. I had to be late for work.
You didn't go to bed?
I was sleeping.
But I woke up because of the noise outside.
Yeah.
Today another man died at work in the mountains.
It's hard to work under the scorching sun.
It's hard.
What are you working there for?
Is it really a risk for life?
This village is built around a quarry.
This village is built around a quarry.
Our ruler doesn't allow us to slow down the delivery.
People have no freedom at all.
You look terrible.
I see you ate, but...
Here's a cockroach.
Why did you let him go?
People can die, but bugs can't?
People, bugs, what's the difference?
They're all equally alive.
I've never met a man who would say that.
You're weird.
Yeah?
Okay, but you're gonna eat anyway.
And sleep.
That's the main thing for a man.
I've never met a man like that.
It looks like I'm not the only one hungry here.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Damn, I'm so tired.
We've been walking all night.
What's the point?
Where the hell is that spider-monster hiding?
My brain doesn't work at all.
I need to sleep while it's still cold.
What's written there?
Another man disappeared last night.
So the reward was increased.
Last night?
But there were no traces of the monster.
Did I make a mistake about the fact that it was a monster?
Who was it then?
And the man who takes others away, will they catch him?
I don't think they'll catch him.
No matter what the reward is,
no one will bring the ruler to us for sure.
There's nothing but bugs and grass here.
I hope we'll find something to eat and rest until nightfall.
Ahagi, I see you're getting weaker and weaker every day.
You...
I saw you leave this morning.
It was dark, but you didn't even take a torch.
Do you work anywhere else except on the moon?
Yeah, after the moon, I have another job.
And I consider it my main job.
It must be hard.
Ahagi, I see you're sick with some kind of ailment.
But there are no doctors in this village.
And without the traveler's permission, you can't get out of here.
But I can help you get out.
Well, it looks like I won't find any young prey here.
If only I could get out of here.
But I have nothing to pay you back with.
That's enough.
I forgot.
I'm just like that cockroach.
Yeah, you're right.
All lives are equally valuable.
I don't want to die either.
Then help me.
With pleasure.
We need to leave as soon as possible.
So today is the day between the moon and dawn.
Until then, have a rest.
But if the kidnapper is not a monster,
it will be difficult to find him.
Looks like today is our last chance.
Brother, this is the last night of our search for the monster.
I know we're hungry, but let's try.
Where are we going?
The exit from the village is on the other side.
There's a guard everywhere.
I'll take us to the secret passage.
We'll get there just before dawn.
So just be patient.
Walking two nights with a hungry stomach is not easy for a child.
I'm sorry, brother.
It looks like luck turned away from us.
It's time to leave this and move on.
Akagi, maybe you should rest a little?
Think what you say.
I don't want to ruin your life.
You're that guy from yesterday.
You're the ones who asked about the reward.
You again!
Did you come for my life?
You two bastards!
That voice like in the forest.
It's her!
Brother, it's her, the monster-spider.
I knew she was the kidnapper.
It's better to get away from her, friend,
or I'll suck you dry.
We'll get food after the victory over the monster.
Let's go, brother.
Akagi is a monster?
Didn't you hear what I said?
This woman is a monster and a kidnapper.
The kidnapper is me.
I help people get away from here.
Akagi has nothing to do with it.
I don't care if they catch me.
Let Akagi go!
She's sick and weak.
Sick?
Why are you protecting the monster?
So it was you.
We finally found you.
We're the ones who found him.
You'll give us our reward.
Wait a minute.
It was just a trick for the kidnappers.
That's not fair.
Only the villains act dirty.
Let it be so.
If we lose more workers,
our work will slow down
and our heads will fly.
Catch him alive!
It tastes awful.
Brother!
So you won't just let him go.
Don't just stand there.
You're not done yet.
Where do you think you're going?
This way.
Okay.
Brother, I'll help you.
What are we going to do now
when we've got our reward?
What are we going to do?
I'll go with you, brother.
Are you scared?
If we go on foot, they'll catch us.
It's okay.
Then let's go.
Hold on.
What are you doing?
I think you're much better now.
I don't think you need me anymore.
I'm not that strong
to cross the mountain yet.
I need to kill five or six more people.
Are you going to kill them?
They're valuable.
I'm not taking their lives.
As long as they're alive,
I don't care.
As long as they're alive,
the power comes back to them,
and then I drink it again.
The secret of longevity is to live together.
I see.
And now, too, right?
Yes.
Okay.
Brother!
You can't even get in there.
It's easier to follow them.
Let's go.
Is this the secret passage?
It's narrow, but it's spacious inside.
Do you hear the water?
Go to the sound,
and you'll get to the stream on the other side.
This is a natural cave.
You don't need light.
They won't be able to catch you.
My job is done.
Now go.
You're coming with me.
Now that they know who you are,
you can't stay.
Think about what they can do to you.
Yeah, I think my body will serve as a warning.
Do you want that?
No.
Then let's run away.
Don't you want to be next to the monster?
Okay, Ahagi.
Why die in this village?
I'm not going to die.
I'm going to live like your prey.
I've never met such strange people as you.
Let's go.
No!
That's what happens when you betray the ruler.
Kill him together with that woman monster!
Bastards!
I'm going to drink your life to the last drop!
Brother!
Brother!
Brother!
Brother!
Brother!
Brother!
You say there are no doctors here.
Then I'll take you to one.
I won't let you die.
It seems that only one of us will survive.
Please.
Don't.
Ahagi, you didn't kill before.
You won't live now.
They left after all.
A monster who fell in love with a man.
This world is full of surprises.
It's good that you got your ears back.
Otherwise, everything could have turned out not so well.
You still don't want to talk?
Okay, I'll have to talk to you two.
Maybe you'll cheer up.
The spider bit me!
I'm sorry.
You must have been even more scared.
What was that just now?
Did you faint?
I heard him.
Your first laugh.
But not in this situation.
I hoped to hear him.
Why are you laughing?
I wanted a happy laugh.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
To be continued.
