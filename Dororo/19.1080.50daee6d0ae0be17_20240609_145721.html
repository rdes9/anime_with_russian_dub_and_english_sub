        <pre>Episode One
The merchant said that it will be right before the mountain pass.
And we have already passed three.
He also has strange habits.
Dororo, a horse.
Yes, if we have such a long way, it will not bother us.
I don't want to go anywhere anymore. Is there such a horse or not?
No, I need this. If there is no, we go further.
Okay, okay, I'm not serious.
I see.
It seems that he said that the blacksmith was called Munetsuna.
Let's go, brother.
Anilibria.tv presents Dororo.
Episode One
Episode 19. The story of Monodjaku.
Munetsuna? He lives in the outskirts of the village.
Really?
Yes. You are not going to ask him to make you a sword.
Isn't he a good master in this matter?
Nothing special.
Wait, we were told something completely different.
He made me this ax and I'm not impressed at all.
And he has a daughter, Akova, scary and with a terrible character.
I never liked their family.
Coming.
Wait a minute, you have some complaints about your father again.
Who are you?
This is Lee, the house of Munetsuna.
Yes, he is my father.
Then you are Akova?
Yes, so what?
During our travels, we heard that your father makes the best swords.
Ah, so you are a buyer. Yes, my father is the best master in swords in the whole country.
Yes, but the residents of the village ...
Oh my God, these people are constantly saying not what they are, but they continue to make orders from us.
So he's really good?
Well, of course.
Then we would like him to teach us.
They clearly went through a lot.
Oh, brother!
Akova!
What are you doing?
Brother!
I told you not to do that!
Why?
Because you can't!
Why?
Because you will scratch the crown!
And what is the crown?
He will get angry if we distract him.
Wait a minute.
The first impression is very important.
Don't take away the swords.
Brother, look how funny.
Dad, we have a buyer.
He needs to be taught how to wield a sword.
And it looks like he wants to marry me.
What are you doing?
Brother, please don't get angry.
The first impression is very important.
These swords ...
Whom did you kill?
Well, why is that?
We never cleaned swords like that before.
You don't need to know.
Bishamon, the guardian god, is watching over this temple.
Dad and all the villagers go to pray to him.
And this is the face of Hyotaka, the god of blacksmithing.
Is this a funny mask?
The face of the god?
This is because he blows out the flame.
Blows out the flame?
She takes bad luck from our family
and passed it on to our son for many generations.
God who blows on the flame?
Who the hell blows like that?
Something wrong?
Hey, put the sword here.
Okay.
What's going on?
What?
Brother, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
What?
God!
Now is not the time to suffer nonsense.
I'm going to the hotel.
It was a hard day.
Munetsuna said that the swords will be brought here
when they are ready.
The swords will come here?
Yeah.
So let's take a break for now.
It turned out to be cheaper than I thought.
Can we relax for now?
I don't need to.
I haven't been so tired for a long time.
I can already hear you saying that you don't need the sword.
I don't need it.
What are you talking about?
You need it if you want to get your body back.
Mr. Hyaku.
Dororo.
This is Hyaku.
Come in.
Mr. Hyaku.
I thought you were hungry and brought this.
Thank you.
I'm so hungry.
It looks delicious.
No, Dororo.
First, the host of the house is treated.
The host of the house?
Who is that?
Listen.
Brother and I are on a very important mission now.
As soon as the swords are ready, we'll go.
I'm ready to go with you.
Are you crazy?
This is not a walk for you.
I'm the only one who can help the brother.
Don't worry.
I'm the daughter of the best sword master in the whole country.
Okay.
Tell her, brother, that you can't be with Sokova.
I'll be with Sokova.
Mr. Hyaku.
Listen, don't joke like that, brother.
I'm serious.
Our journey is over.
What about your body?
I don't need it.
It's okay.
Body?
It's true.
Forget about your stupidity.
I'm serious.
What should I do then?
There is no reason to be together anymore.
It's okay, Mr. Hyaku.
Dororo can stay with us.
Repeat it again.
I don't need Dororo anymore.
Fine.
I understand everything, brother.
You're a stupid piece of an idiot.
Listen, I'm incredibly glad that Sokova and you will be together now.
What did I just see?
So cute, Dororo.
You two are meant to be each other.
Thank you.
I'm so happy.
That's right.
I really think so.
Oh, Dororo.
What is it?
Give it to me.
You dropped it on Hyaku.
Looks like Dororo has found us.
Dororo, you look happy.
Stupid brother.
I don't need you anymore.
What's going on?
My condolences.
What a terrible tragedy.
You're right.
We're not the only ones who are in trouble.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
I told the villagers that I was going to marry you.
What's going on?
Sokova.
Sokova.
Sokova.
Sokova.
They say that in wedding dresses the girls are sitting next to each other.
I'll make you the ugliest one.
You can count on me.
Okay.
It's not always like that.
I'm so happy for you, Sokova.
I've been dreaming all my life for you to get married as soon as possible.
I wish you a good wedding.
Thank you.
He's so honest.
What's going on?
It means that you and I will soon become husband and wife.
Husband and wife?
I decided that the sooner the better.
So the ceremony is tomorrow.
Isn't it too fast?
Okay.
Wait a second.
What wedding?
I want to congratulate you from the bottom of my heart.
Okay.
No matter what anyone says, you and your brother are waiting for a happy future.
Are you sure it's going to be like that?
Damn it.
What's going on with me?
Hey, stop it.
Dororo, it's okay.
I'll be the husband of Makova.
Dororo looked happy.
What's going on?
Makova is in the bathroom.
You love her so much, don't you?
That's great.
Then I'll be the husband of Makova.
Dororo.
You look terrible.
Why are you so jealous?
Did you spend so much money on this dress?
Mr. Hyako.
You can't look at it yet.
Just look at it.
It's okay.
They'll come here.
If he doesn't need the sword, then I'll throw it away.
I'm really going to do it.
What are you doing here?
Don't scare me like that.
Who needs this?
Is this a new sword, brother?
He hasn't given it to you yet.
He hasn't finished yet.
I just finished cleaning.
So what are you going to do with it?
So that's why you wanted to pull it out.
Brother suddenly got tired of his goal.
And I'm not talking about what I mean.
I don't know what to do anymore.
It looks like
that brother doesn't understand
what I feel.
Since we met,
he has helped me so many times.
So I decided
to help him
through all the difficulties.
I promised myself.
But now...
How can he stop now?
I came for you.
You just came for me.
Just a few days ago.
What a fool!
Did I fall asleep like that?
Don't interfere.
I'm sorry.
Aren't you going to
Akova's wedding?
For a sword master,
nothing is more important
than creating a sword.
Akova will understand.
Do you really like swords?
So you don't?
I don't like samurai.
And the swords
that don't kill me either.
I hate it when people kill people.
I dream of creating a sword
that will stop the battle.
A sword in which a person
will not want to fight and give up.
Is it possible?
It won't be easy.
I don't think I'll live
to see it.
I just know
that I shouldn't use your power
for evil.
I was wrong.
I have to stay with my brother.
Is it really
your wish?
Of course!
What?
Am I saying
what I really think?
Why is everything okay
when I'm here?
Wait!
When did I start
saying the opposite?
When did
my brother
start acting strange?
That's a lie!
Let's go!
It's time to go to the temple!
Why?
To play the wedding!
Why else?
And then the villagers
will have a celebration!
The swords will come here.
They will come after
we return from the temple!
The swords will come here.
Is it your business?
I knew it!
Dororo!
Brother!
What kind of monster is this?
Looks like
we were acting strange
because of him!
Grab him!
No, no!
Not there!
Not me!
Grab him!
What are you doing?
Lord Riku!
Dororo!
Brother!
You're going to kill Dororo!
Stop it!
Lord Riku!
Dororo!
Are you okay?
Dororo!
Brother!
I'm sorry.
I was worried about you.
Who could have thought
that it was true?
So it was all
because of that monster?
There is a legend
that when you lived here
in Monajak
and did evil in the village,
it was sharpened here.
It turns out that we were really
under the protection of the gods of Yotaka.
How long has he been here?
How do you know?
Please.
So, now
Lord Hyaku and Dororo
will be friends again,
so let's get back to the wedding!
Wait, it turns out
that if everyone
talked in return for the monster,
that means
Dororo and Lord Hyaku
It's not your fault, Mr. Hyaku.
I'm sorry.
Okawa, you don't have to go after him.
I couldn't tell you about my feelings before.
Unlike this dirty guy, I promise to make you happy.
You'll get out because of me.
What kind of people are they?
Okawa looks happy.
Wow!
I told you so!
Okawa!
Okawa!
Okawa!
Okawa!
Okawa!
Okawa!
I told you that my father is the best in the whole country.
Nothing happened.
Well, do you like it?
Brother, you're so happy.
I'm happy.
Yes.
They went through cruel tests that a normal person cannot imagine.
And the path is not over yet.
You haven't had a place next to him from the very beginning.
Well, of course.
I was constantly doing what I could to kill such monsters.
So, Mr. Hyaku, don't bother with other people's heads anymore, ok?
Why?
Because you got Makushka!
What is Makushka?
I'll explain later.
Well, brother, let's go?
Let's go together.
Of course!
Who else but me can travel with you?
You and I are happy.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
The sequel follows.
Amano-Jaku.
