Terrible
It looks like that bastard ate all the rice harvest before he was able to pick it up.
Sir, I checked the village.
What happened?
Some fields were filled with rats.
It was as if all of them had terrible misfortunes.
In some villages, people suffered from diseases.
The closer the border, the worse the situation is.
And it looks like it's spreading inside.
Could it be because of the demons?
Because we couldn't kill him.
We have to find out.
Let's go to the castle.
Please, sir.
Could you please give this boy some food?
It's delicious.
Eat some more.
Try to survive.
As the one who is responsible for these lands, I give my word.
I will never leave you.
To be continued...
The 20th episode.
The story of Noe.
Wow!
Where should we look?
It's so bright!
It's so bright!
It's so bright!
Wow!
Where should we look?
It's so bright!
Dororo.
I'm coming.
We came here to look for another demon.
It looks like a lot of people were killed in these places.
It's strange.
I think it's not the first time I've been in the mountains in autumn.
Why am I so happy?
I think I was alone last time.
And I was more concerned about survival.
I think I'll eat one too.
Is it for me?
For you, Dororo.
Brother!
Give me food!
There are four seasons.
Spring, summer, autumn and winter.
It's autumn now.
In autumn, the mountains become so bright red.
But I think they're not as red as the demons.
You feel so good when you look at them.
I mean, they're beautiful.
I just found out about it too.
You'll see it one day.
I'm sure you will.
And not only the mountains, but also other beautiful things,
like the sun or the clouds.
Why are you scaring me?
Are you listening at all?
I want to hear more stories about Dororo.
Brother, you've changed.
Yes, you've definitely changed.
You're not like the first time we met.
I have so much to tell you.
But first, let's deal with the local monster.
Are you looking for a monster?
Who are you?
Relax.
I came for the monster's head too.
My name is Saburo.
I've been looking for him for almost six months.
The beast is not weak.
I've been fighting him many times.
And that's all I've got.
Why are you so excited about him?
He ate my mother in front of my eyes.
Your mother?
I'll never forget it.
That day, I felt as if there was emptiness inside me.
I see.
Your hands.
I see you've been through a lot with them.
I'm scared to even imagine it.
Let's go, Dororo.
He comes here on certain days.
That's what he's like today.
Don't worry.
He's a strong brother.
He'll avenge your mother.
I'm glad to hear that.
He's coming.
What's wrong with him?
His body?
He's made of pieces of different animals.
Demon!
Let me go!
Brother!
What are you doing?
You're pretty good.
Why are you so angry?
I'm not angry.
You're pretty good.
Why are you on his side?
Won't he kill your mother?
Even if I kill him, my mother won't come back.
That's why I'm taking other lives instead.
I give him food for everyone who goes through this place.
They all scream and beg for help.
Only then I stop feeling the emptiness inside.
You...
驚略
The Last Crusade
Sir.
Something weird is happening.
From the statue, one of the demons sometimes gives out something like a heart attack.
It's weak, but it's clear.
When she lost her head, I felt it clearly.
One of the twelve demons was the one who couldn't eat my son.
Now the Goddess of Mercy is broken, just like your deal.
And the prosperity of these lands will stop at that.
Dororo? Dororo?
Brother...
That's right. We fell off the cliff.
That guy...
Dororo.
It's all right. I'll be right back.
I can't do it.
Dororo.
Don't worry. I'll get out of here.
Look, it's under you.
You can't do it with your hands like that, brother.
I can.
We're almost there, Mom.
We'll go over the hill, and then we'll go to the doctor with our hands.
I'm sorry for all this, Saburotto.
I'll be able to get famous with him one day.
We won't have to sell our skins anymore.
We'll have a good life.
Oh, Saburotto.
Saburotto.
Saburotto.
Next one.
I'll bring another one.
Or maybe it's time for me to go to feed them.
Dororo.
Stop it! You'll break your hands like that.
Do you still need them?
It's all right. I'll find a way to get out of here.
Dororo.
Dororo.
Now it's all right.
It seemed to me that I heard a familiar voice.
I'm glad I made it in time.
Do you want a body?
I do.
Why?
Because it's mine.
Take it, father.
I'm afraid.
Demon.
So you feel this way too?
I'm afraid.
I'm afraid.
I'm afraid.
I'm afraid.
I'm afraid.
I'm afraid.
I'm afraid.
I feel so empty here, but there's nothing I can do.
Saburoto.
Saburoto.
What's that?
There was something here.
He left her here alone to die.
Are you a samurai or santa?
No.
failure...
Let's go, Saburoto
We'll avenge her.
Save me!
That's it.
She's the same for everyone.
No!
Why?
Why don't you run and save yourself?
Aren't you scared?
Come on, scream!
Please, save your life!
Save yourself!
No!
I...
I would fly away...
from someone like you.
But...
It's too late.
No!
Brother!
What's going on?
I...
Give him back.
You...
Give him back.
You're just...
not human.
Everything is as it was with the forest ghost.
He killed the demon,
but no part of it came back.
Give him back!
Stop it, brother!
That's my body!
No!
That's wrong!
Sir, look!
What's that?
Please...
stop it.
Brother!
Brother!
Where are you going?
Give him back!
That's my body!
Wait!
Brother!
No one has the power
to choose one's fate.
His soul is heavy.
That's what it means
to carry his fate.
