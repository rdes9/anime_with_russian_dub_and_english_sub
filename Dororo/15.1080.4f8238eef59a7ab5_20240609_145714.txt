Wow!
To be continued...
Thank you for the delicious breakfast too!
We are rural residents, so our food is simple.
I'm glad you were able to rest.
Yes, thank you.
I haven't had such a good sleep for so long!
Your room is very good.
It's quiet and quiet.
You can stay as long as you want.
We are very grateful to you.
We have enough rooms.
Stay with us, if you are in a hurry.
You are so generous despite the difficult times.
Can I have more?
I don't know how in other places,
but in our village there is peace and harmony.
Maybe we are not rich,
but we don't need much.
Thank you!
We were given the opportunity to live here,
and we are grateful to heaven for the blessing.
I was thinking about what to say
so that he would allow us to stay.
I couldn't think that he would offer it himself.
I won't let the demon run away.
Next time, the huge one can come right after you!
Yes, it will be so.
I'll go for a walk, talk to the residents.
I want to know the details about the nun and the monastery.
What about you?
I'll take care of Sabama.
Okay, but don't do anything wrong.
Maybe the old man was brainwashed.
He has a grumpy look,
but he shouldn't judge by his appearance.
Dororo!

The History of the Hellish Show
Yes, yes!
Thank you very much for finding the time to help me!
No problem!
What else do we need neighbors for?
Be careful!
I'm getting old.
Now we will definitely live through the winter.
What happiness!
There's not much work left.
That's right, let's push it!
You must be tired.
Let's take a break and have some tea.
Thank you!
Wait! Wait for me!
Everything is like in a normal village.
What a big tower!
Grandma, who is that?
Hey!
Do you want some buns?
Me?
They are very tasty!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
So, you are Mr. Sabame's guest.
Yes.
He was very kind to let strangers stay here.
I'm very grateful to him.
Bun!
Here you are!
Thank you!
It looks delicious!
For Mr. Sabame, this village has always been in the first place.
We can live in peace.
Only thanks to Mr. Sabame.
He is the one who needs it.
At least think about who you are talking about.
I'm sorry.
By the way, I saw a burnt monastery on my way here.
Do you know about it?
We have to go.
We have to do something while the sun is still high.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
This place is my favorite.
From here I can see the whole village.
Suspicious.
A large warehouse in the forest.
Far from the village?
Suspicious.
Something is definitely wrong here.
What is going on here?
Maybe they keep treasures there?
And there is no guard.
This is just another warehouse.
The villagers are clearly doing a good job.
When your stomach is full, your heart is warm and calm.
To stick to your goals when it comes to life and death
is not something that anyone could easily do.
But they really could store a lot.
Much more than I could carry.
Wow!
What is this?
Some kind of secret hatch?
I can't see anything without a torch.
Of course you can't.
What are you doing?
I'm sorry.
This is for the sake of protecting the village.
Wow!
My ancestors protected this land with generations.
I was born and raised here.
I became a ruler and now I am here.
I never knew other places.
Villagers like you will hardly be able to understand me.
This village is all for me.
Whatever happens, I will protect it.
You came here to kill the demons that live here?
Right.
I won't let you.
They are also my residents and I will protect them.
Hey!
What the hell?
Let me out!
Let me out!
What's wrong with them?
These people are terrible.
I have to tell my brother.
But first I have to find the light.
Oh, it's not...
Brother!
Our village has already experienced hellish times.
Samurai who fled from the war and became bandits
constantly attacked our peaceful village.
No one followed the fields and they became victims of insects and wild animals.
People starved and stole food from each other.
And in the midst of all this hell, I came across them.
Demons.
If we are destined to live on this earth,
I must protect it and my people.
It didn't matter to me that they were demons.
I was ready to give my soul if it would help save my people from that hell.
Demons ate those bandits and killed the animals.
They kept their promise and the village began to flourish again.
And I invited her home as my wife.
Let me ask you.
Why are you killing demons?
No!
I'm not going to be your food!
Damn it!
No!
Why?
I don't care what you're protecting.
I killed demons and I'll get everything back.
You saved me.
Dororo was kind to me.
That's why I'll save Dororo.
Dororo!
Don't let the children run away!
You'll have to feed Mrs. Maymayonbo.
It's for the sake of the village.
Don't hold back your anger.
How cruel!
For the sake of the village?
But...
You're so kind, Dororo.
Thank you.
Don't cry.
We have to hurry before the children of Maymayonbo wake up.
Follow me.
The bandits don't seem to understand you.
Dad!
They finally woke up.
You'll fill their hungry stomachs.
You're the same.
You're the same.
You're the same.
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!
Brother!
Brother!
Brother, listen to me.
They were the villagers.
They killed the nun and the children.
What's there?
The village.
It's on fire.
I was at the warehouse.
I was pushed into the hatch.
And then these huge bugs ran after me.
They almost ate me.
And then they ran after me.
They almost ate me.
And then this huge child saved me.
And then...
Those spirits...
It turns out that these children were killed.
Are you listening to me?
Yes.
And oil.
Oil.
There was the oil that burned the inn.
It was the same smell.
But they can't use it anymore.
Mr. Sabama, all the rice that was in the village has burned out.
We can't survive the winter.
Mr. Sabama, what are we going to do now?
How are we going to survive this winter?
Listen, you had some stock of rice in the house, didn't you?
Your house hasn't burned out yet.
Back off! This is my rice!
Do you want to eat it all alone?
Sabama, do something!
I heard that it was his guest who set the fire.
Really?
Yes.
That's what Ribenko said.
Brother!
Brother...
Ribenko
Ribenko
Ribenko
Ribenko
What happened?
The whole village...
Why?
Why did this happen?
Brother, did we do something wrong?
Is it all because we came here?
It doesn't matter.
Even if you defeat three other demons, the world will not change.
You only think about how to kill demons.
Answer me!
This is wrong!
You'll just become one of them.
Your sense of distance hasn't recovered yet?
No.
One more time!
It doesn't bother me.
Dora...
I wish my brother had listened to me more.
Dora...
Hello, Dora.
Long time no see.
Good luck.
Good luck.
What are you doing?
I've been looking for you for a long time.
You're such a bitch.
Shut up!
Ta-da!
Now show the other half of what you've got.
This is Bon.
The roles were voiced by Deis, Itashi, Malevich and Hikomi.

Thank you for choosing us.
Thank you.
