In the next episode
Father, what did you feed the demons of your son for your own purposes?
Son, what did you get from the ashes to bring back your body?
Here, in the land of Daigo, which flourishes thanks to this sacrifice, they both met for the first time.
Hekimaru did not know what these languages ​​of the flame meant, but they still attracted him.
Who are you?
I wanted to dance
I can't sleep
The day of passion will someday
Someday
I notice from the nose
The fireflies will disappear someday
Hey, I shouldn't have needed anything
But I still love you
Hey, I shouldn't have needed anything
But I still love you
Baby
Sorry, darling, I'm not that sweet
But I'm not that bad
Give me fire
Light it up, baby, I'll burn you
Hey, I shouldn't have needed anything
But I still love you
Hey, I shouldn't have needed anything
But I still love you
Hey, I shouldn't have needed anything
But I still love you
Give me fire
Light it up, baby, I'll burn you
Who are you?
Are you an idiot?
He's not the one you can address like that.
Don't you know the ruler of our country, Mr. Daigo Kagimitsu?
Where did he go?
Who are you?
Why are you alive?
You are the son of a demon.
Kill him!
Follow him!
Go!
Sir, let's go back.
Why are you still alive?
There he is!
Get him!
Why are you still alive?
You are the son of a demon.
I wasn't born that way.
The son of a demon?
Let me go, you bastards!
Let go of me!
Sukiroku!
Daroro!
Get him out of here!
At least let Sukiroku go!
Sukiroku!
He just wanted to find his mom!
He just wants to go home!
Shut up!
You came from the other side of Banmon!
From the monster country!
Monster country?
Sukiroku!
Are you all right?
Were you hurt?
Were you able to get home?
Home?
Not anymore.
The whole village.
They were all killed.
And my mom, too.
Sukiroku!
Sukiroku!
Everything's going to be all right.
You have me!
I'm sure the Tsukemaru brothers will save us.
And then we'll be able to travel together.
But don't cry.
Right, don't cry.
Don't worry.
People of Daigo are under the protection of the Goddess of Mercy.
Goddess of Mercy?
Yes.
That's why the Sakurai clan can't get through.
That's why the Sakurai clan can't get through the wall that calls Banmon.
Isn't Banmon protected by demons?
The Sakurai soldiers told us so.
And something about the country of demons.
Those who attack the land of Daigo are real monsters.
The heavens will punish them.
Tell me, what about this Herb?
This is the family Herb of the Daigo clan.
What?
Up there!
There's a passage!
It leads outside.
It's too high to get through.
We're small.
We'll get through.
Let's run away, Sukiroku.
Or they'll kill us.
So be it.
Then I'll meet my mom.
You fool!
Don't give up now!
Come on, get up!
No!
I'm scared!
It's too high.
It's useless.
I can do it.
I'm not going to die here.
I'm not going to lose to the samurai and the war.
Wait for me, Sukiroku.
My brothers and I will come back to save you.
Yes, Aurora.
Sir, please calm down.
Let me pass.
Mother!
Tohomaru, what's the matter?
Mother, tell me,
do you remember a child whose hands, legs, eyes, nose and ears were eaten by demons?
A child that you and your father mercilessly fed demons 16 years ago.
Mother!
There was not a day that I forgot.
You scoundrel!
We have a fugitive here!
Hurry up!
Don't let him go!
Hurry up!
Come on, back off!
Aurora, go!
I won't give up!
I'll wait for you!
Sukiroku!
Go!
I won't lose either!
Be careful there!
Mother!
A child on the river,
innocent child,
for the sake of the country,
and you still call yourself parents?
It's exactly because we're parents.
Father!
Tohomaru, you just don't know
the terrible days that our land went through.
Endless hunger,
illness,
natural disasters,
neighbors constantly trying to capture us.
Our country was at the brink of death,
and my deal with the demons was able to save it.
All the inhabitants now enjoy its riches.
You did it not for the sake of the inhabitants.
The truth is that you did it for your own purposes.
The goal of the ruler is the goal of his people.
For the sake of them, I sacrificed someone else,
like my own son!
And as a warrior, I am not ashamed of it!
The violator!
Hikimaru!
Why are you alive?
Inborn son of a demon!
Everyone, come here!
Shoot!
Son!
Mutsu! Hyogo! Stop!
Sir, are you wounded?
No!
Don't let him go!
Kill him!
My husband!
Father!
It turns out that he is my brother!
Tohomaru!
Are you going to sacrifice the country for the sake of your brother?
Do you want to throw your people into the abyss of hell
for the sake of not feeling guilty?
In that case,
go to hell!
Go and blow up my deal with the demons there!
Then your brother will return the body
and our country will die!
Son!
Inborn son of a demon!
Father!
Dororo!
What a joy!
Brother!
We must save Sokiroku!
Bad news!
Everyone will be shot at the banmon
to declare war.
It seems that the banmon demons have finally left.
So now our master is preparing to attack.
Move!
Why did they call for weapons from the wounded and old people?
The Sakuran army is so huge!
I heard that some violator broke into the castle,
but the army is not ready yet.
The ruler defeated the demons.
What a mess!
There is only one of them here,
who seems to be locked up.
But who knows for how long...
Well...
This is a slave from whom an old man like me will die.
But how could he defeat so many demons on his own?
Sekimaru...
I don't know who called him that,
but the name speaks of how he lived.
I can't believe that the war will begin soon.
To protect all this, we must kill my brother.
Perhaps it will be through Chura morally.
Or am I wrong?
It's so good that we are not the ones who have to decide this.
You are always like this.
I must say that my brother and I are very grateful to you.
If the Daigo country hadn't blossomed,
we wouldn't be here.
Well...
What's the matter?
No, no, nothing.
Please forgive me.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Please forgive me.
He looks so much like Sekimaru.
Forward!
March!
Forward!
The fact that the statue of demons is broken
is clearly not on its own.
There are damaged ones here.
Perhaps.
The deal between the ruler and the demons has already been broken.
By my brother.
So, Daigo Kagemitsu is the ruler of this country, right?
And his family name is exactly the same as the one you have on the amulet.
So, what did his wife tell you?
Son.
Well, then, for sure.
We found their mom and dad.
You even have a brother.
Cool.
I'm so glad to see you.
I'm so glad to see you.
Mom.
And mom has already given up on the sugar.
No, she hasn't given up yet.
Hurry up, brother.
Until they shoot him at the amulet.
What are we going to do, sir?
We're going to kill him.
No, no, no, no.
We're going to kill him.
No, no, no.
No, no, no.
What are we going to do, sir?
Do you want to throw your people into the abyss of hell for the sake of not feeling the guilt?
We are no longer afraid of Banmon.
Here is our gift for you from Asukura.
Take it.
Grandpa!
You bastards.
We can no longer wait for our master.
Forward!
There's a battle going on.
It's already started.
What are you going to do?
Brother.
It seems that the wheel of fate has made its turn.
And I am destined to follow where it leads.
Please stop, ma'am.
All I did was pray for years.
My life was filled with falsehood.
What's going on?
These are the demons of Banmon.
They're not there.
Who's there, sir?
These are demons.
Sir?
That's his father.
He's the one who cut my hand off!
No, brother! You're not a demon!
It's not my fault! I just followed orders!
Brother!
Brother!
My name is Takamaru. I'm your younger brother.
See? Brother! I told you!
You're my brother!
Brother, I don't think what your father did to you was right.
For the sake of the prosperity of this country, he fed you with a demon.
Inborn...
So it was him who did all this?
Yes! It was my father, Daigo Kagimitsu!
But it was a sacrifice brought for the sake of our country!
It's... it's too cruel!
Brother, if we break the deal with the demons now, our country will perish!
And you, the one who threatens the peace of our country, are now a demon for us!
Well said, Takamaru!
And that's why it's my duty to kill you!
Sir!
Don't interfere!
No, it can't be!
Taroora!
Suki Roku! Are you there?
It's been tied up for a long time. I can't untie it.
I can't untie it.
Brother, you should come here now.
Taroora!
Almost there!
Forest Spirit!
He's coming back! Taroora!
He's not coming out!
You won't make it! Taroora, run!
No! Brother!
Brother...
Where's the Forest Spirit?
He's been absorbed into the banmon.
Really?
But I'm not sure.
Ma'am!
Poco!
Mother...
How could you be so cruel to us, Hikimaru?
To a mother who couldn't protect you on that day?
And to a father who fed you with a demon?
And to a resident of Daigo, whose happiness is built on your sacrifice?
Cruel...
You don't know what he went through.
It was too cruel!
Poco!
Even Takamaru has already understood everything!
How many times do I have to tell you?
Hikimaru!
Please, forgive me!
I...
I...
I can't...
save you!
No matter how wrong it was,
no matter how much you suffered,
all that our people can do is ask for your forgiveness!
We can only continue to eat you like demons to live on our own!
Well, that's fate.
Hikimaru,
you will no longer suffer in solitude.
If you demons need more human blood,
take mine!
No!
Ma...
Ma...
Mother!
No...
Back!
Muso!
Hyoga!
Take Takamaru with you!
Brother!
Tsuki Roku!
Run!
Yes!
You've caused great trouble for us, Hikimaru.
I can't.
Save yourself!
Save yourself!
Brother, let's go.
We have nothing else to do here.
Are you coming with us?
Yes.
Sokiroku!
Sokiroku!
Mom!
Mom!
Sokiroku!
Mom, are you alive?
Mom!
We were able to run away and hide.
We were waiting for them to stop guarding Banmon.
Sokiroku!
I'm glad for you, Sokiroku.
Although they are alive only because demons eat the bodies of their brothers.
Don't worry, brother.
You have me.
Sokiroku!
Sokiroku!
To be continued...
