The guide may or may not be very helpful.
I think I can help you.
Mr. Bivomara!
Once upon a time, there was supposed to be a cry in this country.
But before he could be delivered and he was silenced,
however, he continued to be delivered all over the world and to this day.
I'm hungry, I'm hungry
I'm looking at the red and black
And I'm alone
Until the burning flame is extinguished
There is light in the darkness
We check each other's distant voices
So that we can stand on our wet fingertips
Someday I'll touch you

What? Why?
You lived here. Always.
Yes. Unlike you.
Then what do you lack?
What?
What do you lack?
Like me.
Why?
So what? What do you lack?
Shut up!
If I have something and nothing, it's because you took it from me!
Murzu and Yoko! Mother!
I'm with you?
Come back!
Return everything back to this country!
It should be there, brother.
But we can't go through here.
Brother! Brother! Brother! Brother!
Dororo!
Monk, you came too?
Everything is on fire here.
What are you doing?
This is a secret passage. The lady is already downstairs.
Is that you?
Dororo, wait for me upstairs.
You'll help me to get out later.
I'm coming too.
Dororo!
Please stay on my son's side as before.
You...
It should be you, Mother Hikimaru.
He really has your face.
Who are you?
Dororo!
Why?
Why didn't you kill me now?
How could you hit my head?
Why?
I don't know.
But you are the same as I am.
You are a human.
I lost.
No, I always lost to you.
Always.
Takamaru...
This is my chance to fulfill the contract!
Where is she?
Demons!
So they just don't give up!
I'm glad!
I'm returning them to you!
What's going on there?
I can't just stand here.
I'm counting on you!
Are you going to just leave me here?
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
Yakimaru!
My son!
Finally!
I can hold you!
I shouldn't have let you go. I shouldn't have let go of your hand then.
I should have held you like I do now. I love you so much.
I love you so much.
That's the way it is.
Hekimaru, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have let go of your hand or your leg.
Listen, Hekimaru, you have to live.
Let not a demon, but a human live with your blood and flesh.
His fire is already burning inside you.
Brother!
Go! There is a child who is waiting for you and who will stay by your side.
Go!
The fire will soon be everywhere. Hurry up!
Try not to breathe the smoke.
I know.
I know.
I know.
I know.
I know.
I know.
I know.
I know.
I know.
I know.
I know.
I know.
Hurry up!
Try not to breathe the smoke. You can live easily.
My soulâ€¦
Takamaru, I'm sorry.
Because of me you felt so lonely.
But I won't leave you anymore.
I will stay with you forever.
Don't worry.
I will never leave you.
Year and end.
Year and end.
Mother!
You're back!
Takamaru, I'm with you.
All right.
I'll pull it now. Are you ready?
Wait a second.
Are you ready?
I'll pull it then.
We're saved.
The brothers' hands are so soft and warm.
He finally got them back.
Beautiful.
The sky is beautiful.
The sky?
You're a fool too.
What?
You're a fool?
What are you talking about?
Can you see?
Can you see my face?
Don't move or you'll fall.
Don't move or you'll fall.
Don't move or you'll fall.
Can you see me, brother?
Can you see me, brother?
This is how your fate ends.
Let your eyes look closely.
Let your eyes look closely.
What is it?
What is it?
Mr. Takamaru, I have bad news.
I'm afraid to tell you about it, but...
Go ahead.
The castle is burning and the fire has spread around.
The house of the young master has completely burned down.
The young master and your wife are missing.
I'm afraid that...
Justice!
We will destroy the Osaka castle!
We will destroy the Osaka castle!
We will destroy the Osaka castle!
We will destroy the Osaka castle!
We will destroy the Osaka castle!
We will destroy the Osaka castle!
We will destroy the Osaka castle!
Go ahead!
Go ahead!
On that day,
to get rid of the army of the Osaka castle,
an innumerable number of people
fell in the name of Daigo.
And then
the last statue of the demon
was broken.
But no one could replace it.
But no one could replace it.
I understand what you're talking about.
I understand what you're talking about.
You don't have to rely on the samurai to survive.
You don't have to rely on the samurai to survive.
We would all be happy if we could.
We just don't have the strength for that.
We just don't have the strength for that.
We don't know how to use swords and spears.
No, you don't understand.
We don't have the strength for that.
Then what are you talking about?
Listen carefully.
Money.
We don't want to depend on the samurai or the demons.
We don't want to fight.
Then all that remains is money.
That's great, of course.
But where are we going to take them?
If we had money, we wouldn't have suffered.
I have money.
It's a little far from here,
but there's a whole mountain of gold hidden there.
But there's a whole mountain of gold hidden there.
Really?
Where is this place?
Calm down.
In a couple of days I'll send for them.
So be ready.
So that's how it is.
A very bold idea.
Did you hear everything?
Did you tell me to think about how to use money?
Did you tell me to think about how to use money?
I didn't mean something serious.
I didn't mean something serious.
The land where people build their own country.
The land where people build their own country.
I don't think I've ever thought about it,
because I'm one of the samurai.
Samurai?
You?
It doesn't matter.
What about Heikkimaru?
He looked very thoughtful since that day.
He looked very thoughtful since that day.
Yes.
I told him that I wanted to cheer him up.
And then he left,
saying that he wanted to check something.
Check?
And what?
He just said that it was something related to him.
Maybe he wants to check
if his new body is working well.
I don't know.
Maybe he wants to check
if his new body is working well.
Maybe he wants to check
if his new body is working well.
Maybe he wants to check
if his new body is working well.
Maybe he wants to check
if his new body is working well.
Maybe he wants to check
if his new body is working well.
Maybe he wants to check
if his new body is working well.
Maybe he wants to check
if his new body is working well.
Looks like you took back
everything the demons took from you.
What a world you finally saw.
What a world you finally saw.
Isn't it beautiful?
I wouldn't say that.
I wouldn't say that.
The people and the country
have been pouring too much
blood for you.
Their blood will still
Well, I'll let it all end this way.
The world is made in such a way that either you kill or they kill you.
That's how it is.
I will take revenge on myself for life in this hell.
If the demon wants a man, then I'll just feed him to them.
Are you insulting me again?
Why not?
I am the ruler of Samurai, and power is the only thing I want.
For the sake of her, I'll make as many deals with demons as I need.
If I ever made a mistake, then only in one thing.
You shouldn't have.
Then I'll give you back to your leader.
I should have strangled you with my own hands.
Do you despise me?
When I die, my soul will reign together with Takamaru.
In the form of a demon that will protect this country.
Well, hasn't he come back yet?
No, he wasn't in the castle either.
He said he'd be back soon.
Maybe he decided to leave for good.
What does that mean?
Maybe he decided to go on a new journey.
Why would he do that?
Would he really leave?
He didn't tell me anything.
Don't worry about it.
The boy still thinks he was just born.
And it's not that he returned his body.
I'm his heart and mind.
I don't understand.
He needs to get out of the way of evil
and return to the path of man.
It won't be easy.
He killed too many people.
I understand.
His mother and brother are already dead.
Of course, I said it wasn't his fault.
If Takamaru returns to the wrong path again,
you may be in danger.
Is he all right?
Is everything all right with his brother?
Maybe that's what he didn't want to check.
So it's him.
Why?
My new path...
is like this.
I'm a man.
Don't become a demon.
Live like a human.
Hyakkimaru...
If I hadn't turned to demons on that day...
If you had become my heir...
to the prosperity I wished for so much...
Hyakkimaru...
There is strength inside you to live.
Strength that is desperate to turn to demons.
Hyakkimaru...
Hyakkimaru...
I will wait for you.
One day you will definitely come back.
Right?
Hyakkimaru left.
Dororo began to walk his own path.
The era of great warriors was getting closer.
But Bivamaru continued to believe
that something greater than blood and despair
was waiting for these two young souls in the future.
The End
The End
The End
The End
Dororo and Hyakkimaru. The End
