Episode One
Brother, why are you in such a hurry?
What's going on?
Nothing.
Let's go.
Come on!
It must be the Asakura scouts.
They were jumping from Daigo's side.
I see.
Wait, brother!
I have a very bad feeling.
It doesn't matter.
My body is in Daigo's side.
The Asakura scouts

Episode Twenty-first
The story of a broken order of Mooks
Report!
Two new villages in our territory have been infected.
There is no choice.
Burn down the villages.
The infection must not spread.
Report!
The Asakura clan is now gathering its army.
About two thousand people.
Are they already performing?
No, they are not moving yet.
What about our forces and supplies?
We are gathering people from allied and non-infected villages.
But there are not enough of them yet.
Then hurry up!
Yes!
And the prosperity of these lands will stop there.
No!
I'm sorry.
All men who can walk are called to the service.
Move!
Please, could you leave a couple of men?
Women and children will not cope with all this.
Please, leave a couple of men.
Please, leave a couple of men.
Women and children will not cope with all this.
Please, leave a couple of men.
Women and children will not cope with all this.
Our country is in danger.
What could be more important?
You have come so far for the sake of these horses.
It seems that the matter is serious.
What a beautiful horse!
We are taking it.
Midora is our best horse, a feeder.
Please, return it back, it did not hurt.
What are you talking about?
We are fighting for our country.
Well, let's go.
Now I'm the master here.
How are you?
Well, how are you?
Meya, help me!
Now.
At the moment, they are heading here.
Are you sure this is Hikimaru?
Yes, I'm sure.
The child was also with him.
He will be here in a few days.
So he is really a warlock.
At that time, Asakura will already make his move.
What are we going to do?
I'll go and deal with Hikimaru.
The small detachment will not be able to take him.
But we can't send the whole army to him now.
I don't need anyone while Mutsu and Hyogo are with me.
Father, if we don't stop Hikimaru now,
we will never be able to stop him.
Good.
Go.
Are you sure?
You saw his look.
No one will stop him.
I'll go and deal with Hikimaru.
I'll go and deal with him.
I have an order for you.
Listen, brother.
What?
When we get to Daigo,
what will you do if you meet dad and mom?
If they get in my way, I'll kill them.
But if you do this,
you will never be able to be with them.
I'm ashamed.
Why are you standing here?
The master is waiting.
Many will die again, huh?
Almost like us back then.
I hate living hell.
Yes.
We have to defeat Hikimaru
and put an end to all of this.
I know.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I won't let people in my country suffer anymore.
Let's get rid of the evil.
Yes.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry...
I'm sorry...
I'm sorry...
I'm sorry...
I'm sorry...
The same is true for Tahamaru, who turned into the Asura to save Daigo,
the wife of the ruler or the mother of his children.
If I were one, but not both at once, I would not curse my helplessness.
Madam…
Hekimaru…Tahamaru…
Hey, wait a second.
Are you from Daigo by any chance?
No, why?
Then you'd better turn around and hurry up.
The war with the Asura will begin here soon.
Damn, so much time has passed.
Everyone said that I could get rich in Daigo.
But in the end, what could be more precious than life?
Hey!
Brother!
Get out of my way.
What are you doing?
You heard him.
The war will begin here soon.
I'm going to the Asura.
I'm going to the Asura.
I'm going to the Asura.
You heard him.
The war will begin here soon.
I understand your feelings.
But maybe that's enough?
No.
I'll get my body back.
But you heard that man.
Could it be something more precious than life?
I'll get it back.
Great.
But I won't go with you.
Why?
They took him.
I just...
I just don't want you to become someone else.
I'm scared.
Why should I become someone else?
Touch with my hands.
See with my eyes.
I want to feel
the same way you do, Dororo.
Damn it!
What should I do now?
Why should I?
Damn it!
Are you all right?
Yes.
I'm just tense.
I see.
I didn't notice you before.
And Hyogo...
As usual.
Exactly.
We've been together for so long.
How long has it been since Mr. Kagemitsu saved us, Hyogo?
Good for you to survive.
It's going to be all right now.
You sharpened the dead man's bone?
Relax.
I'm not your enemy.
I'm not your enemy.
I'm not your enemy.
I'm not your enemy.
Takamaru.
This is Mutsu and Hyogo.
They're going to live here from today.
They're going to study and train together with you.
Mutsu, Hyogo.
I want to achieve peace
with my father.
To stop meaningless deaths.
I want to make sure that no one
goes through the same as you.
And in the name of that,
I will make Daigo the strongest country on earth.
We have the same goal as you and Mr. Daigo.
I'm just your humble right hand.
And Hyogo has become your left.
We will protect you with everything we have
until the day of your triumph comes.
That day is already near.
Yes.
I won't let you leave this country.
Forward! March!
Forward! Daigo soldiers!
There's no one to be afraid of!
Takamaru.
That's Takamaru!
Takamaru!
That's Takamaru!
Takamaru!
Takamaru!
Grandpa,
it's them again!
Takamaru!
Stand back!
He called me a demon.
It looks like he's even angrier than before.
Be careful.
Shikimaru, you won't hurt this country anymore.
I, Takamaru, will kill you right here.
Good job.
But this is the end.
...�
G Congrats!
Take this!
I need your hand!
Thanks...
Is athletic
God bless our country, Kizema!
I will kill you, even if it is cost me my life!
Oh, my God!
Yes, we live!
Come with me!
Deeper!
Brothers!
Brother! Brother!
Why are you here?
Mr. Kagimitsu ordered me to look after you.
Takamaru, my heir.
Make sure he comes back alive.
Please, you have to step back.
Get out of the way!
I have to destroy Ikemaru, otherwise the country will fall.
This is an order from your father.
I don't care!
I'm sorry.
Ikemaru...
Master!
Take him.
Stop! Stop!
Let him go! You bastards!
Why do we need a child?
Ikemaru is probably still alive, so he will come in handy.
Use helpless cowards!
Get me out of your snot!
Even if it breaks you, even if you yourself become devils,
your only task is to protect the master!
It's a shame that in the end he protected you!
Let's go.
Brother!
Brother!
Roro...
