Give them back!
Give them back what?
You know!
They were never yours!
They were never yours!
They were never yours!
They were never yours!
They were never yours!
It's a thought from those who return to the fighting!
It's a thought from those who return to the fighting!
What?
Hey, calm down already!
Don't worry.
We'll soon find a place where we can escape.
Well, well, what's going on?
I've never seen her so wild before.
I've never seen her so wild before.
It's probably a demon.
It's hard to say for now, but just in case we have to take the woman and the children away from the border.
The war is going to happen anyway.
How much can we do? We're constantly moving somewhere and it's the same everywhere.
Hey, stop!
Something's wrong here.
I'll go check it out.
You can at least put them away.
I'm with you.
Brother.
This is mine!
You're mistaken.
These eyes are now Daigo's eyes.
And Daigo's hands too.
It would be strange if she didn't have them.
No, she's already at the brink of death.
Because you interfered with the deal with the demons.
There is no more time.
For the sake of the lives of people, we must take everything from you.
We will swallow you, Daigo!
This is my body!
THE END
THE END
THE END
The 23rd series. The story of the demons.
Tachamaru, Mutsu and Hyogo.
Brother!
Stop!
You won't live there for a second.
But we have to stop them!
No, I'm not sure that Hikimaru will be able to recognize you now.
The other three were not the same as they were before.
I know them.
I know them.
The other three were not the same as they were before.
I know them.
I know them.
There is no mistake.
The same thing happened in the hall of hell.
The hall of hell?
What hall?
The place where there are 12 statues of demons that Hikimaru ate.
But one of these 12 couldn't eat him.
I see.
Now it makes sense.
That's why Hikimaru survived.
That's why he is haunted by demons.
They are trying to eat what they couldn't eat at once.
Why is that, brother?
You still haven't been able to get your body back.
What other parts are left?
Rocks and nails.
I think the answer lies in those three.
They are now possessed by the power of demons.
Now it's a terrible fight for the body parts between Hikimaru and the 12th demon.
It's all because of the treaty that my husband Taiga Koemitsu signed.
Without Hikimaru's sacrifice, there will be no prosperity in the country.
Oh, Motto Hamaru!
Hey!
Hold the horse!
I'll be right back!
It's time!
Stop right there!

No!!
It's over.
Your master Kiyomizu was right.
Your master-
psychology falls off.
I don't understand.
I though he's your master-
Mutsuâ€¦
No!
Mutsu!
Yaga!
You must be joking.
We will follow you to hell, sir.
Yaga!
Yaga!
Yaga!
Yaga!
Yaga!
Yaga!
Yaga!
Brother!
Ikemaru!
Yasu!
Go away, mother!
Takamaru!
Do you still feel sorry for this creature?
He is the curse of our country!
Stop!
Brother!
Yaga!
Yaga!
Even if he is a beast,
the connection between mother and child is strong.
Brother!
These are my hands!
My hands!
Why do they keep getting in my way?
The fact that you will come back will be covered with human blood.
Will you be able to stay human in this moment?
Human?
What do you mean by human?
I...
The curse of our country!
No!
This belongs to me!
I am returning what is mine!
What do I know?
There is nothing wrong with that!
You won't get away.
Yaga!
Again with his hands!
He is getting further than before!
Takamaru!
The fact that you will come back will be covered with human blood.
No!
I don't care!
THE END
How can I stop them now, brother?
I think that it is impossible to stop them
until one of them dies.
Tell me,
from what I have heard,
it seems that this Hekki Maru has returned his body to the demons.
That's why all the troubles happen here.
And what happens next?
Well...
It seems that if he returns his body to the demons...
Repeat it!
So now you want to live at the same price as your brother?
Do you even understand what he went through to return your body?
I know that all of you went through a lot, too.
But you don't care that the other person will suffer even worse?
We are exactly the same as those samurai and demons.
What about you?
Calm down!
We are not delighted with that either.
But think for yourself.
If you choose one of your brothers and the whole country...
Stop it!
But...
He says that the country is more important than the brother.
That's how it should be.
You...
So you don't have any truth at all?
But...
Such prosperity...
A world built on someone's sacrifice is fragile.
Now I understand it very well.
All these happy years of life in our country
were only thanks to the sacrifice of one Hekki Maru.
We were just chickens who were fed by the chicken.
And now we sit, open our mouths and wait for them to feed us.
We can't protect what we haven't achieved with our own hands.
And I...
I can't stop even my own children.
With your own hands, huh?
The warriors and the samurai always took something from us.
But if we just complain about the samurai's war,
nothing will change.
In the end, we just wait for the samurai to do something for us.
If we have something we want,
something we want to protect...
Then we have to take what the brother is doing.
Grab and hold with our own hands.
And for that, we have to be strong.
We have to become stronger.
I see.
But be careful.
You saw their fight.
In pursuit of power, you can turn yourself into a samurai.
In pursuit of power, you can turn yourself into a demon.
Or you can give up your power and not fight anymore.
It will be the path of Buddha and mercy.
But no matter what choice you make,
you will no longer be a human.
Gentlemen!
A new army of sakuras has appeared in the east!
There are about one and a half thousand of them!
Take people from the Mitsutoshi regiment.
You can't get through this.
Otherwise, they will be here by tomorrow.
Tell the soldiers to hold them back at any cost.
I have no right to lose.
Otherwise, I will not be able to fight.
I have no right to lose.
Otherwise, the money will be worth everything that happened before.
Everything.
I can't allow this.
As a ruler, I couldn't make the wrong choice.
Gentlemen!
Your son is fighting with two owls that look like a human demon.
They say their fight is some kind of abnormal.
What do you mean abnormal?
I don't know, sir, but Mutsuo and Hyogo are the only ones with him.
I don't have people to help him right now.
Calm down.
Takamaru, the heir of Daigo, will definitely win.
He will not lose.
I have to fight too.
I'm going to defend the east!
Get ready to fight!
That's how it should be.
Sir!
Leave the castle immediately.
There will be a demon here any minute.
If you value your life, run!
Yes, sir!
You say you shouldn't be a human anymore?
There are no humans.
I don't want to be a human anymore.
I don't want to be a human anymore.
You want to live, you say?
People can only fight between two extremes.
Maybe that's what makes us human.
You can't say that until you try!
Because you're just strong, you can't stop being a human.
We spent a lot of time together with our brothers, and that's why I know.
It's not about strength, it's about the heart!
If you have a kind and strong heart, you won't become a demon!
I'm tired of being a victim of war and samurai all the time.
We have to defend what belongs to us ourselves.
Yes, but how do we get that kind of strength?
We can think about it later.
We just have to start now.
So please, brother.
Well, tell me something in the end.
Is it hard to fight with your long arms in a room?
Hikimaru.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Hikimaru, you were born in this castle, and you're going to die here.
Give them back to me!
The last thing that's left!
Hey, look!
Isn't it the castle that's burning?
Did the enemies break through?
No, I think it's...
Brother, right?
Hey, wait!
You too?
I have to go.
Those who are fighting there now are my children.
Maybe I can't do anything.
But I'm still their mother.
Hikimaru.
It's time for me to do what I have to do.
Why did they let Aki go?
Aki, you know, I think now I understand something.
About what needs to be done.
But I can't do it alone.
Let them take your eyes, hands, legs, whatever they want!
If you want your eyes, I'll be your eyes, your limbs!
Don't stop the demon! Don't die!
Well done!
No!
No!
No!
