In the course of many years, the lands were already plundered by wars.
The soil was soaked with blood, and the sounds of many survivors
were heard in every corner of the country.
The sounds of the war were heard in every corner of the country.
The sounds of the war were heard in every corner of the country.

Just kill me!
Let this be a warning for the rebels!
Darling! No!
And give her some too!
And give her some too!
And give her some too!
And give her some too!

Dororo!
The third episode.
The story of Jukai.
Hey!
Hey! Kaname!
Hello.
This is for the doctor.
Oh, thank you very much.
Yeah, compared to what he gave us, it's a trifle.
Thanks to him, my son can run again.
When there are people like that around, it seems that this world is not so bad.
Exactly.
You can move her with your shoulder muscles.
You just need a little practice.
I have a hand again!
I'm so happy for you!
Are you really not taking money for this?
I'm doing this because I want to.
Thank you very much!
Teacher!
Show him how to use a new hand.
Okay.
Next.
Dr. Jukai seems to be Buddha himself.
Yeah, that's for sure.
The teacher gave me a reason to live, even when I was an orphan.
I'm so glad I can work here.
Oh!
He didn't sleep all night?
It hurts so much, Mom!
I'm almost at the doctor's.
There's just a little bit left.
It hurts!
What happened?
Is Jukai still far from home?
Some samurai decided to fight him and cut off his hand.
Son!
Don't worry.
The teacher will definitely help him.
It will take some time, but I will do everything I can.
Thank you so much, doctor!
What a happiness, right?
Yeah.
Thank you so much one more time!
He will be able to play soon, just like before.
I was afraid he would turn out to be a bad person.
I'm so glad I was wrong.
Never believe any rumors.
Rumors?
Forget it.
Kaname.
Teacher.
Is it true?
Is it true that you were at Shiba's in the past?
The alien ship picked me up after I fell into the sea.
I went to their country with them.
There I learned to make prostheses for those who needed them.
I know it's not my fault, but just dying pretending there was nothing would be unforgivable.
I should have died then, but they gave me life.
So there is something I still have to do.
During the war with the Shiba people, my father was killed...
Father! Father! Father!
You killed my father!
Kaname.
Please.
You're asking for life after all...
I don't care about my life.
When I finish my job, do what you want.
Yes.
Let me help the child I promised.
Just for him?
Thank you.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Only for Him.
Thank you.
Thank you, doctor!
Goodbye!
You'll never buy this.
I won't let you be a savior.
You'll never buy this.
You'll never buy this.
Are you alive?
Do you want to live?
One year later.
Were you born?
Yes, it's a boy, sir.
You did it!
He'll be my heir!
Six years later.
One year later.
I see you've come to see this crab.
Be careful, or it will scratch your mask.
Like this.
Let's take it home for dinner.
It's time for us to return.
For the second time I was given life.
This boy lacked many body parts,
and he hardly heard me.
But he had an amazing power.
An amazing power.
A powerful power.
The pull of life.
Is that your name?
Hekimaru.
There are worse things in this world than hundreds of demons.
You shouldn't attack them, Hekimaru.
I'm sure you'll overcome them.
One year later.
One year later.
Hekimaru, are you all right?
What was that?
What is it?
Monsters!
They must be attracted to your power.
Hekimaru,
I can't always protect you.
And so that you can protect yourself,
you must become stronger.
Victory is yours.
Mr. Hekimaru, you're so strong.
I wish my power was not equal in this country.
Hekimaru, what are you doing?
Father!
Not so high!
Mother!
Something wrong?
Listen, Father,
tell me about your last war.
All right.
One year later.
I'll treat his wounds.
He doesn't feel pain,
and so he doesn't know fear.
His hand knows no doubt
when he strikes or takes his life.
I only wished for one thing.
That he would overcome his fate
and live strong.
But it was hard for me.
Did I make the wrong choice again?
Hekimaru, are you all right?
What's wrong with you?
Hekimaru!
Your right leg.
Did you put too much weight on it?
Are you unwell?
I'm fine.
What's going on?
It's impossible.
The leg has grown on its own.
How is it possible?
THE END
Demons.
Demons don't just eat people.
Sometimes they deceive people
by giving their power to them.
They let people take advantage
of their supernatural powers.
But they always, always
take something in return.
It seems that your body was taken away
as a result of such a deal.
I can't go with you.
I'll just interfere with you.
Hekimaru, I couldn't do anything to you.
All I could do was teach you how to kill.
It was with you when I found you.
I think it will help you find your parents one day.
THE END
It seems that if he kills the monsters,
he'll get his body back.
Yes, I think so.
It must be that many years ago
someone made a deal with the demons,
paying the body of this young man.
How cruel!
I don't know what they got,
but his eyes, mouth, nose, everything was taken away from him.
Yes, the one who did this knew for sure
that he would go to hell.
I can't even hit an animal with one eye.
How do you know?
Maybe that's how they hit their souls.
What does that mean?
Hekimaru, are you awake?
It's hot, isn't it?
I see. You got your pain back.
What are you doing?
Are you out of your mind?
Hey!
Idiot!
I have nowhere to go.
Hekimaru.
Thank you for watching.
Thank you for choosing us.
Thank you for watching.
See you next time.
THE END
