Not that!
Don't eat me, please!
No!
Baby, sorry, darling, I'm not that sweet
But I'm not that bad
Ah, dear me, why?
I love you, baby, I'll burn you up, baby
I love you, baby, I'll burn you up, baby
Baby, why?
I love you, baby, I'll burn you up, baby
It's been raining for two months
If it continues to dry, the harvest will suffer
The neighboring clan of Asakura is growing in concern
We have received news that they are slowly gathering troops on the border
We should do something before they start the war
This is a stone face
It has to do with the secret my father is hiding from me
Mutsu, Hyogo
What are you doing here?
I'm here to help you
I'm here to help you
I'm here to help you
I'm here to help you
Hyogo, I want to ask you something
But no one from the family should know about this
Hyogo, I want to ask you something
But no one from the family should know about this
But no one from the family should know about this
It must be that child
He's still alive
And he's trying to bring his body back to you
Answer
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
Is that all?
Brother
Oh my God
You know, that merchant said that the land there is very rich
That they even continue to eat snow-white rice at such a time
Great, right?
Let's go there later
We'll make a lot of money, so we'll have enough for a long time
Sea food, dried mollusks, fresh manju
Manju?
They are soft, sweet, and so delicious
You'll like it, you'll see
By the way, I've been interested for a long time
This family crest on your amulet, does it belong to your family?
I found him
He will answer all your questions
My father gave you a special order, didn't he?
What did he conclude?
Find a child who disappeared 16 years ago
Or else, in turn
Child? Why did the father need some kind of child?
He
Answer
He tried to bite off his tongue
He could?
No, the wound is not very deep
The drug must have weakened him
Father, what are you thinking about?
Asakura's concern is growing in the clan
Only about this?
Father, why are you trying to find a child?
It's been more than 10 years
And how is this connected to the headless statuette?
Father, what are you thinking about?
Asakura's concern is growing in the clan
Only about this is connected to the headless statuette?
The one that the mother prays on
Please answer me, father
It's none of your business
Well, the conversation is over
How did you manage to survive?
I knew you wouldn't find me.
You used to come here often as a child,
if something happened.
And we used to come here every time.
All the time.
Sir,
let's go home.
It seems that
your father
still considers me a child.
That's why he keeps secrets from me
and doesn't take them to war.
I've never seen my father
like this before.
Why is this child so important to him?
I don't know.
Why is this child so important to him?
What's going on?
Please show mercy!
Don't leave us!
Let me go!
Right now!
What's going on here?
Mr. Tokhomaru,
we came back
from that village,
and they attacked us.
Please,
save us!
Otherwise,
the monster will eat our whole village!
You call it a monster?
A stream?
A stream of water
starts to move in a circle.
The stream of water
starts to drag the center,
where a huge mouth is already waiting.
It will eat everything,
people and boats.
Many residents
of our village
have fallen victim to it.
A stream of water
in the center.
It sounds incredible.
Okay,
I'll go see the monster.
Mr. Tokhomaru,
do you want to tell me
that you believe in these people?
Even if that's true,
you shouldn't fight monsters.
I don't think they're lying.
My people suffer.
Do you suggest I throw them out?
No, I didn't mean that.
If you're afraid of monsters,
go away.
Nobody's going to catch you.
You don't have to go either.
You must be joking.
We'll go after you, even to hell.
What is it?
A paddle. It's stuck in something.
It's coming!
It's him! The monster!
They're eating us!
Calm down! Pull the ropes!
What's next? You won't be able to eat us until you stand there!
It's a crab! A monster crab!
What a terrible sight!
I'll kill you right now!
Gentlemen!
No!
He's gone.
He's attacking us from below!
Mr. Ntahamar!
Pull the ropes! We're coming back!
We've got him serious. He won't go after us.
He's going to make a few more holes.
The boat would go to the bottom.
He has an advantage in the battle on the lake.
What are we going to do?
Sir, I have an offer.
The monster is going to attack us.
Sir, I have an offer.
The monster is going to eat everything with his mouth.
We can take the explosives under our clothes and blow it up as soon as he swallows us.
He has a strong shell on the outside, but not inside.
It's probably going to kill the monster.
But the one who the monster swallows will die with him.
We'll do it.
I told you you were going to die!
We won't die.
We live only to protect you.
We can't protect you if we die.
That's why we won't die.
Sir.
Look at this land.
The mountains are covered with greenery.
The rivers are full of water.
Rice is growing in the fields.
This is Daigo's land.
But I heard that it wasn't like this before he was born.
The rice fields were flooded.
In order not to die of hunger, people chewed the roots of trees.
And the one who made this land so rich is my father, Daigo Kagemitsu.
And like his son, Tachamaru, I will overcome any monster with my own hands.
The only thing I ask is that you don't die.
Trust me.
I don't need anything else.
Sir.
Yes, sir!
Hyogo, get me up.
Faster!
Higher!
Get me up!
Here it is.
Mutsu, gather everyone.
This is the only way to defeat him.
It won't be easy.
I'll need your help.
Come on!
We've been waiting for you, monster.
Open your eyes!
Next to the big lake, there are several smaller ones.
We connected one of them to the big one and the other one to drain the water.
And here's the result.
Now I see you.
And this time I will definitely kill you.
All of you, stay behind.
Let's go, Mutsu, Hyogo.
They'll be okay, they can defeat the monster.
Whoa.
It's hurting me.
See that?
Love is always with us.
They'll be able to get rid of this monster soon.
Wow.
Go ahead, Mr. Tohomaru!
Let him pay for everything!
Mr. Tohomaru!
Get it, damn monster!
Get back where you came from!
So you've come to an end.
I'll stop your suffering.
Get back where you came from!
Get back where you came from!
Protect the key!
Hyouda!
Hold on!
Mr. Tohomaru!
Mr. Tohomaru!
Who are you?
