        <pre>Ma'am, hang in there a little bit more.
You have to be strong, ma'am.
The baby will be here soon.
The hall of hell.
Mr. Daigo,
those who enter the hall of hell have already made their choice.
I will attack and stand on the side of the demons.
I am carefully trying to stop you.
But hear me for the last time.
Mr. Daigo,
attacking Buddha means stepping on the path of darkness.
Those who step on it will no longer be human.
If you cross this line,
only hell will await you.
Monk,
we all live in hell anyway.
The path of Buddha, on which you pray so,
does not exist.
Get ready for the consequences.
I have nothing to do.
Thank you.
This is my deliverance.
As you said, we all live in hell.
My prayers seem to be so pointless.
I was always afraid that there would be a day
when I would repent in Buddha.
I am glad that I managed to die before that.
Mr. Daigo,
please do not betray the demons.
Do not let yourself enter the path of darkness.
It's too late.
Twelve demons.
My name is Daigo Kagamitsu.
I am the vassal of the province of Kaga
and the ruler of Isekawa.
My people suffer from endless hunger and illness,
constantly on the verge of death.
If this continues,
I will never reach the strength and power of which I yearn.
My desires will remain only a dream.
However, I refuse to rely on the mercy of the gods and Buddha.
I did not come here to sing prayers.
I came for a deal.
If you protect my lands and allow me to rule the country,
I will give everything you ask.
Take everything.
I have everything you want.
Hear me out!
There is still a little bit left, madam.
Just a little bit.
Be brave. Protect.
And here is our baby.
What happened?
Is the baby born?
What is it?
He was born. My husband.
This is a boy.
My wife.
My heir. Finally.
Wait, sir.
I do not know what happened.
He is alive, but he does not have hands, legs, nose and even eyes.
He does not even have skin.
I will give everything you ask.
Everything.
Take everything I have.
My husband. I feel boundless love for our poor child.
It does not matter what he looks like.
He is still our son.
My dream will finally come true.
Your husband?
Demons agreed to the deal.
Now there is nothing to worry about.
I'm glad you gave birth to him.
Wait, where are you taking him?
Forget about him, as if he never existed.
No, no.
Madam, you can not get up yet.
Please be merciful.
He could not survive anyway.
Then let them die in my hands.
Enough talking.
I want you to take another child.
No, you must.
The next will be the heir of the great ruler.
What is it?
She was blown away when the lightning struck.
The priestess said she sacrificed herself.
Sacrificed?
You...
It can not be.
My...
It can not be.
Act III
commanderslle AD
I can't sleep
Someday, on the day of passion
Someday
I notice from the nose
Someday the fireflies will disappear
And I shouldn't need anything
But I'm still I'm so serious
I'm gonna burn it up
I'm gonna burn it up
Baby, sorry, darling
It's not that sweet
But it's not that bad
Ah, give me fire
Light it up, baby
I'm gonna burn it up
Baby, sorry, darling
It's not that sweet
But it's not that bad
Ah, give me fire
Light it up, baby
I'm gonna burn it up
Baby, sorry, darling
It's not that sweet
But it's not that bad
Ah, give me fire
Light it up, baby
I'm gonna burn it up
How did this happen?
Life would be hell to you anyway
But go ahead, baby
I'll take care of you
I should get used to this
I should get used to this
I should get used to this
I should get used to these things
Do you really want to live?
Do you really want to live?
The rest depends on your luck
I smell something
I smell
I smell
I smell
I smell something
I smell something bad
What is this?
What is this?
No man
No man
Even though
No man
Even though
And no demon
And no demon
And no demon
I can smell a curse
The land of Daigo-Kagimitsu, which is on the Kage border,
after an endless hunger,
finally stood on the path of prosperity.
But the tiny soul, too weak even to just shout out,
quietly disappeared in the darkness of the unknown,
and there was no one on the earth who could save it.
16 years later.
The wars were constantly going on in those days.
A man's life was worth nothing more than a road stone.
Excuse me.
Aren't you the doctor who makes the dead's prostheses
so that they can be cried on?
Your name is Jukai, if I remember correctly.
You do a decent job.
I just thought it would be better than throwing out the prostheses.
Well, I'm sure they're still grateful to you.
15 years later.
Come on in, don't be shy!
The best product is straight from the capital.
Look, natural silk.
The rich princess used to wear it.
Girl, touch it!
And this is a cup for sake from the Yamate no Orochi legend.
You can't find such a thing anywhere else.
All for a fair price.
And as a gift, I'll put dried fish inside.
Well, come in in turns!
Oh!
Here you are, Dororo.
Well, have you found the goods you're pushing here?
Do you have any proof?
Shut up!
You swore to me that you were hungry, and we gave you the job of guarding our goods.
We've already heard that this is your usual trick, little asshole.
I was asked to make sure that you would pay for everything.
You're the one to blame for being so naive.
Yeah, I won't be such a good boy anymore.
And you'll pay for everything in an adult way.
Come on, stand up, you scoundrel!
Try to catch me!
Come on, come back, you little bitch!
Stand up!
Stop!
Thank you.
Well, don't stand with your head down.
Thank him.
Mom, isn't it a festival today?
Of course not.
It was just recently.
But why then?
He put on a mask.
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
Oh, you little bitch!
Damn, where did he go?
What the hell?
You son of a bitch!
Ah, this is bullshit!
Oh, go away!
Wash your hands first, and then come back!
You're done for now.
Yeah, it was fun.
It's a pity, of course, the goods were good.
Okay, I'll just find a new fool.
Hey, what's wrong?
Did you lose your mom?
Are you hungry?
I have something.
But it's not that easy.
You have to learn to live on your own.
You have to learn to live on your own.
But it's not that easy.
You have to learn to live on your own.
Otherwise, there will be nothing good.
Learn to find food yourself.
I say, it's for your own good.
Now you can't run away, Dororo.
Hey, let him go!
Is he yours?
Then he'll have to pay for what you did.
Stop it!
Then do what we say.
What? Did you get it?
And don't you dare to tear it up again.
Asshole, you asked for it yourself.
Enough.
And don't you dare to show up here again.
Asshole.
No.
No one will point fingers at me anymore.
I'll decide where to go myself.
Do you want to die?
It can be arranged.
Hey, take that piece of straw.
It's time to finish him off.
Just a sec.
Hey, why are you standing up?
Go on.
Boss, there's a weird guy standing there.
What?
His face looks like a doll's.
And his eyes too.
Where does he look?
I don't know.
Hey, buddy, any problems?
If you think he's our victim, then no.
We're the victims.
Hey, can you hear me?
Do you want to fight?
No.
I think he's not looking at us.
Those eyes.
He's looking somewhere behind us.
Hey, what are you talking about?
There's nothing there.
It's just a pile of garbage, that's all.
What the...
It ate him.
He's looking at the monster.
Oh, my God.
Wow, that was so cool.
Your face, eyes, ears.
They're not real.
How do you see them?
So you can't hear anything.
If I closed my eyes, I wouldn't even be able to take a step.
And you ran and jumped, and that's it, even without a rope.
What are you doing?
Hey, what happened?
How are you?
Does it hurt?
What's going on?
Your skin.
Hell Hall.
This...
This can't be.
Mother!
Mother!
I caught a gorlitz for you.
It will make you stronger.
I, Tahamaru, will cook it for you.
What a happiness.
It's the same as that day.
Son.
I'm Kimaru.
Your... Your face.
What is it?
What are you?
Are you even human?
