Who are you?
That's why I wanted to dance
I can't sleep
Someday, on the day of passion
Someday
I've noticed from the nose
Someday we'll disappear
I shouldn't have needed anything
But I'm still here
Someday I'll make it
Someday I'll make it
Baby, sorry, darling, it's not that sweet
But it's not that bad
Give me fire
Light it up, baby, let's burn it up

The story of Ban Mon, Part 1
The story of Ban Mon, Part 2
Who are you?
And those hands?
Hey, don't you want to thank us?
If it weren't for him
Your friend Samurai would have been dead by now
I don't know who you are, but I thank you for saving him
You're welcome
The villagers will finally be able to live in peace
Is something wrong, brother?
I'm sorry, but he's blind and can only see with the help of his soul
Blind?
He can fight like that even without vision
We have so many cool brothers
They travel around the country and kill monsters on the right and left
And not some little guys
We hunt only for real demons and monsters
A reward
Thank you
By the way, we heard that there is a rich country nearby
Do you know which side it is?
It should be in our lands of Daigo
In half a day's journey there, you will get to the city
Thank you
Let's go, brother
Call your name
Hyakkemaru
Hyakkemaru
Hyakkemaru
He said so in our lands of Daigo
There was rich clothing on it
He is clearly an important bump
What are you doing there?
Let's go
I'm sorry, sir
I...
No, don't apologize
It's my fault that I underestimated that monster
I wouldn't lose to anyone in Daigo
But in a real fight
It's useless to talk about it
It's pointless to compare it with the heir of our land
Fresh vegetables! Who wants some?
Red goods!
Get out of here!
It's a demon!
A child of a demon!
A child of a demon has come!
Look, brother, it's anigiri
It's made of white rice
Wow, what's that?
One day is not enough for us
Let's have a snack first
Brother, they have a performance there
For many years
Demons have terrorized our people and lands of Daigo
And as the ruler of these places
I, Daigo Kagimitsu, will kill this demon now
Oh, great goddess of mercy
Let people of Daigo be saved in your kindness
Protect our ruler
And this guy is nothing
This guy? Who did you call this guy?
This is our ruler who brought the country to prosperity
Great Daigo Kagimitsu
That's how it is
He's just like you
And the demon was defeated
Anyone who does not challenge me will be defeated
And the eternal land will remain under protection
That's how it is
I'm sorry that this happened to him
Did you also come here because of rumors?
Something like that
In our harsh times, this land does not look like others
I wonder what the source of her blessing is
I heard that there are demons who were defeated by Daigo
I'm going to go and check it myself
We are not interested in the old corpses of monsters
We are only interested in living ones
Ready to tear everyone apart
That's how it is
Well
I see you killed people too
Be careful
Are you kidding?
Yes
It seems that we will not find work here
Let's take a little rest here and go to the next city
What do you say?
Brother
I say, this is the curse of Banmon
That's why it hasn't rained yet
You can't say that
And in the villages on my way, too, it was dry everywhere
If it continues like this, it's autumn
Brother
It can't be
Daigo's land is under the protection of the goddess of mercy
Yes, but even after all this history in Banmon, the Sakur people are suspicious
I'm sorry
What is this Banmon?
What?
A blind guy who has no hands?
Yes
I believe that one of his legs is also not real
They said that they travel and kill monsters
If it weren't for this guy, I wouldn't be alive
They boasted that they hunt only the strongest demons
And he really killed a huge monster in one blow
His name is Hekimaru
Hekimaru
Once upon a time, it was a fortress that defended us from the clan of the Sakur
But during one serious battle, it was burned down and there was only one left
However, then Daigo's army managed to throw off the Sakur people for the first time
The influence of Mr. Kagamitsu has grown a lot
Wow, what a height
They say that the goddess of mercy who prays to the Lord's wife has been possessed
Well, recently, the Sakur people have begun to gain strength
They lead people and spies to Daigo
They are trying to blacken the blessing of the goddess
Why are demons gathered there, attracted by these corpses?
No one will go there now
Who says that it is possible that she is cursed by the demons that Daigo defeated?
Brother, do you feel anything?
Demon?
Very strong
Hey!
Be careful, if you go behind the wall, you will be killed
What?
Is he just a child?
Why are you so scared?
See?
The watchmen of the Sakur
If they catch you, they will shoot Banmon
You have nothing to look for here
Go and steal the corpses somewhere else
Monster?
Once upon a time, all this was around our village
Then they broke out of nowhere and built this Banmon
Banmon
Banmon
Banmon
Banmon
Banmon
Banmon
They built this Banmon
My house is on the other side
Let me go! Let me go!
Now this is the territory of the Sakur
They will kill you there
Dad!
Mom!
Mom!
The rest have left the village
But I'm not going to give up
One day I will cross Banmon and get home
I'll be back home
We will help
What?
So the Sakur warriors are watching her all day
But what about the night?
Are you stupid?
The night is over
The night is over
The night is over
The night is over
The night is over
The night is over
Are you stupid?
The night is over
The night is over
Have you ever seen something like this?
There are huge monsters all over the place
It's all right
For the brothers
It's not a problem
So this is how you seriously talked about monsters
Usually we don't do this for free
But you fed us, so we're in the account
My name is Dororo
And he is Hyakkimaru
And I am Sukiroku
After all
My boy is alive
My lady
Mister
What are you going to do?
I won't let anyone get in the way
Of the prosperity of our country
Do you think we will remain unpunished?
What?
Sacrifice an innocent child
We will pay for what we did
No
Perhaps we will pay already
What do you think?
Should we leave our country and rot in the water as it was before?
Is it true, my lord, that your desire is to make people happy?
Or is it all for the sake of defeating the enemies and becoming a single ruler?
When will our son come out?
Women don't understand anything in politics
In the land of Asakura
So, Daigaku Gimitsu
An hour ago
He went somewhere with a small detachment
It doesn't look like a walk
And he tried to keep it a secret
See?
The guard Asakura is leaving
It will start soon
By the way, Sukiroku
What is your mother like?
She is big, with white skin
The most beautiful in the village
And she is number one in the preparation of rice pies
Really?
When we meet her, you can also try
Really?
Great
They are coming
Spirit forest
This is the monster of Banmon
So many
Wow!
At such a high pace!
Where did he go?
He called all the foxes here
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
Where did he go?
He called all the foxes here
I don't know
Grandfather!
Here are the stupid foxes
Take it
Here you are
Take it
And more
Here you are
Be careful
This is my chance
Hey, Sukiroku
Stop
One is in danger
Brother
Go
Thank you, brother
Where is she?
What are you doing?
Sukiroku
A traveler with a child, you say?
Around my age
Or a little older
I didn't see
Hey, how are the foxes?
Mister
Take it
I'm sure he still has to be taken care of
But what are you going to do when you find him?
You said that the father was shocked when he heard your report
The father must know something about his past
You're right
The secret that the father hides from his mother
Where did the child go 16 years ago?
Perhaps that guy knows the answer to my question
Hey, are you there?
Mister, she...
The child of the demon
The child of the demon has returned to destroy Daigo
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Sukiroku
Sukiroku
Sukiroku
Where did he go?
Sukiroku
Hey, you
What are you doing there?
Sukiroku
Sukiroku
Sukiroku
Sukiroku
Sukiroku
Sukiroku
Sukiroku
Sukiroku
Sukiroku
Sukiroku
Sukiroku
Sukiroku
Sukiroku
Sukiroku
Sukiroku
Sukiroku
Sukiroku
Sukiroku
Sukiroku
Sukiroku
Sukiroku
Sukiroku
Sukiroku
Sukiroku
Sukiroku
Sukiroku
Sukiroku
Sukiroku
Dakashin
Yukata
What are you doing to this child demon?
Destroy Daigo?
What does it all mean?
Answer me
Age
It's a demon curse
That's it!
That's it!
And now he's come back
to bring back the curse of Daiko and his land!
Yes, it's a bad thing.
