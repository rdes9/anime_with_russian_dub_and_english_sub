Thank you.
Forgive me. I don't know why you're doing this.
To help the living, you could have saved many of them.
It's not so easy to save people.
Your work doesn't mean much anyway.
So you won't come to anything.
Why are you...
Where is he?
Help me!
I'm sorry. I don't know much either.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
What a horrible thing you have become!

Episode 17. The History of Questions and Answers.
Are you really human skin?
Can you smile?
Can you hear me?
You say it's a miracle,
but your eyes are still blind.
I can feel it.
I always felt it.
Yes, I know.
I'm your...
Your...
I found you.
I gave you a body and a name.
Did I do the right thing?
How did you deal with him?
His leg...
His leg is broken.
That's why...
I want...
You must be hungry.
I want this.
Come on, eat first.
There you go.
Wait a minute.
I'll be right back.
Wait a minute, it's going to get cold.
It's all right.
I can feel the warmth and the cold.
Yes, exactly.
It's an old habit.
The rope is completely worn out.
I change it for a new one.
This is the only clue in the search for your family.
Daigo Kagimitsu.
Daigo, did you find a man with the same coat?
Does that mean he's yours?
He fed me with a demon.
What does that mean?
Tell me everything.
What did the man with the coat say to you?
Ikemaru!
Thank God you're awake.
I'll call the doctor right now.
I'm so...
naive.
Sir!
The lady has finally woken up!
That's great news, sir!
I'm in a hurry. I'll visit her when I come back.
You could have visited your mother before you left.
We noticed a demon on our lands.
He had no choice.
Our lord has changed.
Hyogo, you're right.
He's changed.
So, you say,
there's a whole country on your lonely shoulders?
It must be so hard.
I found and raised you,
so that you could live your own life.
I want this.
I want this.
I'm sorry.
I can't give you a new leg.
Why?
You're going to fight the demons again.
When you win and come back,
the country is on your shoulders.
No, the responsibility for this knife is on the ruler, your father.
You may look like a human,
but there's so much human in you.
As far as I can judge,
you had to kill not only demons.
I can see that.
I can see that.
A new leg will bring you closer to hell.
I can't let that happen.
I want...
I'm sorry.
Why?
I can't save you.
I just can't.
I can't save you!
The doctor said it was too late.
Don't do such stupid things again.
I was so stupid.
I wanted to give up my life.
My husband, do you remember the headless
mercy of the goddess?
Yes, you prayed to her all the time.
I thought it was a gift,
a sign from above.
I continued to pray for my son.
When I found out that he had survived,
I thought the prayers had been heard.
I was so hopeless.
Hikimaru was able to survive only because
of the headless mercy of the goddess.
Otherwise, why did his head remain
unharmed when everything else was taken away?
When she lost her head,
I felt it clearly.
There was one of the twelve demons
that could not eat my son.
And the prosperity of these lands,
my husband, will come to an end.
You think too much.
Take a rest and get better.
Are you there?
Continue to watch over the hall of hell.
About the location of Hikimaru,
we noticed a child with whom he walked.
Send Tahomaru there.
And something else.
It seems that there is no one at home.
A family of merchants and several servants lives here,
but no one has seen them for a long time.
Since then, demons have been noticed.
Sir!
It's him.
You have nowhere to hurry.
There is fresh air, food with water,
enough for a long time.
Hikimaru, you asked me why.
I want to ask you too.
Why are you fighting for?
If you leave this cave, you will return to the world of complete evil.
Do you still want to leave?
I want.
Do you want a body?
I want.
You have something that no one else has.
The human body can only become time for you.
Do you still want it?
I want.
Why?
Why?
Have you ever thought about it?
Because it's mine.
That's why I'll kill everyone.
Demons!
Sir!
It's a demon rat!
Be careful!
Hyogo!
Oh, you!
Quick!
I wounded him, but be careful!
Yes!
Hyakimaru, you are right.
Your body belongs to you.
There is no reason to want to return it.
But for this you will have to kill not only demons.
Your father, mother, younger brother,
the people of Daigo, they will all interfere with you.
And as a result, the body that you will return will be covered with human blood.
And carrying this knife will be harder than any of your prostheses.
Will you be able to stay human at this moment?
Only lifeless corpses will remain around you.
And you will be completely alone.
Alone?
Yes, alone.
And I'm afraid that...
No.
There is.
Who is there?
Now.
Now he is gone.
Over there.
He was killing people to feed the children.
What?
Now you will die, dirty creature!
Well...
I thought I saved a poor child,
but it turned out that I sent him to swim across the river again.
Hakimaru, there must be no more demons for you and me than another demon.
Master!
We will kill him! Hyoga!
You will not escape!
Master!
You will not escape!
What are we going to do?
I'll finish him.
Wait.
Burn everything here.
As long as the parents are alive,
the children will be safe.
Yes, Master.
We will do everything we can.
Yes, Master.
We will do everything we can.
Yes, Master.
We will do everything we can.
Yes, Master.
We will do everything we can.
As long as the parents are alive,
the children will be safe.
Master, demon or not,
I do not approve of your methods.
Hyoga!
Let's go back.
Mutsu, Hyoga,
I will never let my blade be dull again.
I will do everything
to protect these lands and their inhabitants.
Master.
Yes, Master.
That's it.
You said that there is someone
on your side.
Do not speak.
It is enough that you understand it yourself.
If there is someone
in your life
who is not your enemy,
then thanks to him
you will be able to remain a human.
Hyakkimaru.
Do you want to know my name?
Exactly.
You did not need it
when you lived with me.
My name?
No, you do not need to know.
Consider me nobody.
I know
who you are.
You are a mother.
You are a fool.
Of course not.
No.
Hyakkimaru.
I see.
I was not alive
in your eyes
until now.
I hope
I still have the right to die.
I can not believe
that he sent a gentleman to kill Hyakkimaru.
Hyogo.
This is for the sake of the country.
I know, and I have made a decision.
I will no longer allow my feelings
to take over.
Hyakkimaru was noticed
by Sadagahama.
We will go there
and kill him.
Forward!
