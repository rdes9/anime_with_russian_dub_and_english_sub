In those days travel was a risky business. It was easy to get lost, to run into robbers,
and any injury could cost you your life.
Travelers who were in a hurry to get lost were a normal thing back then.

The second episode.
The story of Bandai.
You can see! I knew you could!
See?
Otherwise, how could you fight that monster?
You have real talent!
You shouldn't waste it!
Listen, maybe...
Hey!
Are you listening?
So, you kill monsters?
How does your sword even get to your hand?
And this...
When it fell,
a new skin grew on your face.
Before, your face was a mask.
But now it's real.
Right?
How did you do that?
Hey!
Are you listening?
I knew you could see.
What?
You don't want to talk to me?
Why?
Oh, sorry.
That's all.
Cool.
Hey, wait!
Don't go to Seremi.
Wait a little bit.
How do you like it?
It smells very good.
What if I add some salt?
Oh, not bad.
Here.
You really don't see anything?
You don't hear anything
and you don't talk to me?
I don't hear anything.
I don't hear anything.
You don't hear anything
and you don't talk to me?
You're so weird.
Okay.
Listen,
don't you want to make some money?
Thanks to me, you'll get rich quickly.
Maybe you'll become a millionaire.
You think so too,
that's why you didn't drive me away.
Right?
Hyakkimaru
was able to see and hear Dororo.
But there was something
that he was able to see
since he was born.
We can say that it was the fire of the soul.
Everything was determined
by its color.
Hatred is
a very important element
of this world.
Hyakkimaru was definitely
determined by its colors.
Besides, in addition to this ability,
his power and perception
were very strong.
That's why he was able
to survive in the darkness
in which he lived.
Hyakkimaru allowed Dororo
to be near him
because the color of his soul
didn't tell him about the danger.
However...
Here.
I prepared it, so it's mine.
This soul didn't pass by,
but decided to stay near him.
According to him,
this is what he was like.
Wait.
Don't.
Mom!
I said something while I was sleeping.
I see.
You can't hear me.
Can you at least
tell me your name?
My name is Dororo.
Dororo.
And you?
Useless.
So you'll be nameless.
Good night.
Hey!
Listen!
I just found out
how we can work it out.
Let's go.
It seems that some monster
is attacking the village.
The villagers and those
who stay there
disappear from time to time.
It seems that some monster
is attacking the village.
It seems that some monster
is attacking the village.
It seems that some monster
is attacking the village.
We'll kill the monster
and we'll get the reward.
We'll save people
and we'll get the money.
Not bad, right?
The village looks
quite rich.
Is there really a monster here?
You said a monster.
What monster
are you talking about?
Don't pretend you don't know.
We know you're in trouble.
I have great news for you.
This man behind me
is very good at dealing
with monsters.
Just say a word.
Is he really going to deal with them?
You can be sure.
He recently
cut a huge monster
into pieces.
He saw it with his own eyes.
Well,
it's a test.
You have nothing to lose, right?
You're so lucky
that you came.
If you can beat him,
the village will pay you well.
Right, guys?
I like
what you say, boss.
No, I'm just
sorry. My name is Denkichi.
And our boss
is called Bandai.
She hurt her leg
and can't move.
In any case,
you can stay with me for now.
I can't offer much,
but would you like to have dinner with us?
I like talking to you
more and more.
Come here, please.
Wow,
it's so nice.
I'm already
fed up with the whole universe.
But for a village
where the boss is a monster,
isn't it too nice?
And I didn't notice
any rice fields.
Where do they get money from?
Monster!
Monster!
He's coming right here!
He's right in front of you!
Finish him off!
Why are you sitting?
Hurry up!
You don't want to?
See? He wants to fight.
Wait, you'll get it from him.
Come on,
take off your hand already.
Hurry up!
Hurry up!
Please!
What?
He's leaving!
Hurry up!
What's going on?
I'm sorry.
Did something happen?
Did you see the monster?
Yes,
but we let him go for now.
Everything's under control.
Are you sure?
Good morning.
Have you woken up?
The thing is
Mrs. Bandai wants to see you.
Bandai?
Ah, the village chief.
Yes.
I'm sorry, but we haven't had time to make you breakfast yet.
It's okay.
It's okay.
This is where she lives.
Wow!
Good luck.
Why is it so dark in here?
I'll light a candle.
I'm sorry for my appearance.
I can't use my legs.
My name is Bandai.
I'm the head of this village.
Is something wrong with my face, child?
No,
you're just so beautiful.
Thank you for your kind words.
I'm sorry for calling you here.
The villagers of the village told me about you,
and I realized that I should meet you.
Especially you.
Thank you.
Do you know him?
What do you want to do?
What happened?
She's a human!
Stop!
Why?
Mrs. Bandai!
I got it!
The ball!
Hold it!
Hold it!
The ball!
Hold it!
Stop it!
She's not a monster!
Stop it!
Don't move!
Let the boy go!
Lock them up!
What's wrong with you?
Why didn't you do anything
to the monster yesterday?
You wanted to attack
this kind woman!
Now you know for sure
that you can't see anything!
Nothing at all!
It's so lively here today.
It's so lively here today!
It's so lively here today!
It's so lively here today!
It's so lively here today!
It's so lively here today!
I'm so excited.
I finally have someone to talk to.
Did you get caught too,
Mr. Monk?
I heard that
there's a monster here.
I came to see, but I was locked up while I was sleeping.
Why?
How should I know?
Maybe it's connected to
where these people disappear.
By the way,
I think I've seen you somewhere.
You've seen me?
Can you see?
We can see
something that our sight
can't see.
And sometimes our vision
is much sharper.
Do you see things
that we can't see?
For example, for me
you look like a lump
of pure white flame.
Flame?
Your soul, so to speak.
Soul?
Inside?
Oh, it turns out that this nameless guy
looks just like you.
Maybe.
That means
he was wearing a sword.
What happened?
Be careful.
I feel something strange.
I can't see anything!
Calm down.
We can't see anything either.
What's going on?
What was that sound?
Come with me.
It looks like
this well is leading outside.
I can't see anything!
No, I'm scared!
Do you feel it, Rock?
What?
This place?
And here's your friend.
Oh!
You came to attack me again?
To a sick woman?
Why?
It's useless.
We can only see
what's inside you.
And what?
Let me see.
What do I see?
This is it.
I'm sorry I couldn't eat you
for the first time.
I think you're too late.
You're worse than a regular monster.
You're here.
Lemon?
It doesn't hurt, does it?
Mrs. Bandai, run!
Hey! Why did you let him go? What's going on here?
You knew about it.
You knew and fed the travelers.
I had to, or he would have eaten all the villagers.
That's why you asked us to get rid of him.
If we had won, everything would have been fine.
It seems that the one he wanted to get rid of wasn't Bandai at all.
EPISODE 1
That can't be right.
Imagine you just did it.
I guess he was just about to get rid of him.
He was the only one who couldn't do it.
You came to get the rest back?
Interesting. Let's see if you can do it.
Mrs. Bandai!
You don't want to?
You don't want to?
What's this?
There's a lot of money in here!
Wow!
The money the bandai ate.
What does it mean?
There was no place in our village to get the money.
When Mrs. Bandai took over the village, we thought it was all gone.
But the first traveler the bandai ate had a lot of money.
And you couldn't stop?
Is that true? You're just awful!
Even worse than monsters!
Get that sound off of me!
So you wanted to get rid of that sound.
That's the sound of the bell the first traveler had.
The bell of the pilgrim!
I'm sorry for talking too much when you tried to kill Bandai.
I was blind then.
Can't you hear me?
Who knows?
Don't worry about it.
It's not worth it. They often get it around their fingers.
She looked so much like my dead mother.
What are you doing?
Stop behaving like a child!
Can you write?
Monk, what did he write?
Let me touch it and I'll tell you.
Hyakkimaru.
Is that your name?
Hyakkimaru!
I finally got to know your name. Hyakkimaru.
Now I remember where I saw you before.
You were on the river back then.
What?
It's not calm on the borders?
Yes. They increased the number of soldiers on guard.
As if they were preparing for war.
Impossible.
The Sakai clan, our neighbors and allies.
I want you to figure out what this is about.
What happened?
Does it hurt?
Are you okay?
Hold on.
What's going on?
