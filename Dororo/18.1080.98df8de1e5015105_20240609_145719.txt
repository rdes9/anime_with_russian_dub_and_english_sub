Stop it!
No!
This guy...
Damn it!
Rororo, your back.
Hold her back to the fire!
Stop it!
Don't look!
Don't look!
That's how you hid her, Rororo!
Follow me, guys!
Damn it!
Come back!
Itachi!
They are so expensive!
Money for dad!
What's that sound?
The beast is dead.
The beast is dead.
It's dead.
It's dead.
How did you get here?
How did you get here?
I'm glad.
I will kill them all.
Jiromaru!
Eat them all!

Episode 18
The story of the Unforgivable.
We can trust this map, Commander.
Here it is.
I didn't need anything,
until I had you.
You didn't know fear.
You had nothing to do with it.
Strong and beautiful.
What a pity to compare people.
What a pity to compare people.
With you.
Jiromaru!
You are indeed the most perfect.
Before your greatness,
people are no more than just food.
Give him a lesson!
Jiromaru!
Brother!
Hello.
Jiromaru!
Where are you coming from?
It's a shark.
Where is it?
It's a broken man.
There's nothing in front of you.
Tear these bastards to pieces!
Brother!
Where is it?
Romaro!
No!
Brother!
Brother!
Brother!
What are you doing here?
I came for you.
You know, could you hurry up?
I had to carry so many things without you.
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I had to carry so many things without you.
Brother!
Looks like you're back on your feet.
What the hell?
You went through so much.
Killed Romaro.
Just to get your body back.
Just for that, right?
It's so important to you.
Brother, we can't get it.
We have to hurry up.
It's here.
There can be no mistakes.
But it's...
Commander, there's a passage here.
We'll be rich soon.
We'll finally be able to have some fun.
Hey, wait.
What's that?
There's something down there.
It's probably a treasure.
Exactly.
So that's how it is.
I see you weren't sitting around all day.
Commander...
Those who are scared can go home.
Either we find the treasure or we die.
One of the two.
What's that?
Brother, it's...
The treasure.
We found a boat that apparently came to Kimaru.
Besides, we found traces of someone else staying there.
It looks like the robbers.
It doesn't matter.
Kill all the people who pose a threat to the peaceful life of our subjects.
Forward!
It's the samurai Daigo.
What were they doing here?
They didn't come here for my treasure either.
Hey, the treasure isn't just yours.
They're shooting!
Don't let any of the rats get away alive!
Get down!
What's going on here?
The money was almost in my pocket.
There are too many of them on the beach.
We need to find a place to hide.
There they are!
Zeramaru.
Saburamaru.
We'll always be together.
Just wait a little longer.
I'll be there soon and bring you a bunch of presents.
There's no place for you here.
There's no place for you here.
There's no place for you here.
There's no place for you here.
Let's check there.
Itachi!
Hello, Dororo.
You're so lucky, of course.
Don't worry.
Your dad's treasure is still in that mountain.
There are traps everywhere.
That's right, Shaka.
Boom, you're dead.
I'd kill them if I had the time.
There's no time for that!
Forget about the money!
We need to run!
What if the samurai find them?
I won't let them get my money for their stupid war!
Boom.
We're the same.
Boom.
What are you talking about, bro?
You know, Dororo, it might work.
Huh?
They're hiding somewhere here.
Search everything here.
Save me.
They have explosives.
Tell the others to move back.
Hurry!
We need to get to the beach before they realize it's a trap.
The demon that is harming our land, Daigo.
Hikimaru!
Brother.
Maru!
You're going to pay for messing with the demons!
Why?
You're going to pay for messing with the demons!
Why?
Brother!
This is our chance!
Let's run!
But, brother...
We're all going to die if we stay here!
Hurry!
Brother!
What's going on?
I don't know.
Brother!
Brother!
No.
We're the same as before.
Why?
Our lord, the heir of the land, Daigo,
its prosperity and prosperity lies on his shoulders.
His determination cannot be compared with yours.
Why did he kill me?
Your existence itself brings trouble to our country.
You are a traitor to the people of Daigo!
Get down!
Damn it!
We have to hide somewhere!
This is...
This is the place of your cards!
Maybe this is another trap, but...
The fifth stone of the next level is indicated with a key.

Itachi!
Enough!
With these treasures, we could live in a better place.
Itachi!
Prepare for death!
I'll shoot you, you, and all your demonic light!
What are you doing now, brother?
What are you doing now, brother?
Master, finish him off!
Enemies...
Enemies...
You...
I...
Enemies...
I won't let you!
I'll break your second hand!
I'll break your second hand!
Itachi!
Hold on!
Doro...
Please...
Let me take the treasure...
With one voice...
Please...

Now you all go where Jiromaru and Saburomaru are right now!
Doro!
Master!
Mutsu, Tegu, let's go!
Let's go!
Hyoga!

Itachi!
Genki!
Here they are!
It's them!
My Genki!
Itachi!
Itachi!
Itachi!
Itachi!
When you meet your dad there,
don't scold him this time, okay?
What's on your back
can move people and change the world.
It's the source of great power.
I don't know what to do with all this wealth,
so I don't need it right now.
Dad, Mom,
wait a little bit more,
I don't understand.
Wait a second.
It doesn't count, okay?
I'll take some money for the road, okay?
Wait, bro!
Itachi!
