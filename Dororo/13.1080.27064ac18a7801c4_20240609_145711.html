Forgive me! I can't save you!
Brother, you're not sleeping again?
Not now! If I don't sleep, I won't be able to get out of the potatoes for a long time!
Brother, wait!
Wait! Brother!
I wonder why you didn't get anything back after you got rid of that forest spirit.
I won't get anything back until I find and kill it.
That's a good idea, of course.
But you've been making fun of yourself since we left Daigo.
You don't rest at all, you only do what you do to beat monsters to the right and left.
You won't last that long if...
Ouch!
And you, the one who threatens the peace of our country, are a demon to us now!
I can't...save...you!
Brother...
You don't need a father or a mother for life.
You don't need a father or a mother for life.
You don't need a father or a mother for life.
At least you have me!
Brother!

It's great to have a rest there.
They get rid of fatigue, and after them you feel great, as your mother said.
Well, let's go.
And I was told that there was a monster there.
The army of the sakura has retreated, and our land has been blessed with rain.
The deal with the demon is still in force.
But for how long, Leer?
Stop! Let me go! You're not my wife! Let me go!
Let me go already!
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Let me go!
Let me go!
Let me go!
Let me go!
What are you doing?
So this face doesn't suit either.
What a great place to spend the night!
You sit here and have a rest.
And I'll go get some berries.
Yes.
Maybe this house belongs to someone bad, so be careful here.
Just don't kill anyone. Just run and that's it.
Okay?
Like this. I think that's enough.
Let's go.
A waterfall?
Great!
What is this?
It's just a statue of Buddha.
A boy.
And I'm not tasty at all, so don't eat me.
Or I'll clean your hands.
Mom?
I'm your mom?
Mom, it's me.
Dororo.
Dororo?
Dororo?
Brother!
It's not pulling so fast.
Brother, look at her.
Is she a demon?
No.
She's a human after all.
I'm not sure.
My name is Okako.
Okako?
And this is my house.
What?
So you live here alone?
The pilgrims who sometimes go to the waterfall give me food.
That's how I live.
To that waterfall, then.
By the way, why wasn't there a statue of Buddha's face?
Oh, that's a story from the old days.
Once upon a time, a statue of Buddha came to the waterfall.
There he came across a half-destroyed balloon in the form of a Fudo, a wise but terrible deity.
Originally, that statue was known for the statue of Buddha with a kind face.
But after the war broke out, people began to need a statue with a fierce face of Fudo.
Gradually, they forgot about him.
He wanted to return to people and began to cut the statue of Fudo from the balloon.
He made him a body, arms, legs.
But while he was working on his face, an idea came to his mind.
To make the best face possible.
However...
He was only capable of the face he had seen before.
For many, many years he continued to remake his face.
He remained as he was, not making a decent face.
And he died with this bitterness.
I don't really understand.
You're still young, Dororo.
How delicious it looks!
Here you go.
Bon appetit!
Dororo?
This is rice porridge.
It reminded me of my mother.
Yes, you called me mom at first too.
Do I look like her?
Yes, exactly the same.
You're like a twin sister.
And even a voice.
Look, he's already asleep.
He hasn't slept very well lately.
It's okay if he sleeps here.
It's very cold at night in these places.
Take a little more.
I've never tasted anything so delicious before.
Well, are you happy that you liked it?
Thank you.
Listen...
What is it?
Can I...
It's...
Can I call you mom?
Can I?
I just thought it would be easier for me to call you by name.
What to do with you, little Dororo?
You can call me whatever you want.
Mom!
Yes, it's me.
I feel so safe and I want to sleep like this.
Really?
I was so scared that the drug didn't work.
What drug?
About the story with the sculptor.
She has a sequel.
After he died, the statue of Fudo was inhabited by the Vengeful Spirit.
To complete what the deceased began.
Fudo also wanted to get a face.
So he resurrected the sculptor and ordered him to bring alive people.
To take their faces to himself.
I was the sculptor.
I can look into people's souls and change my face and voice for them.
The child's face is not suitable for Fudo, but the face of this young man...
Dororo!
Dororo!
Mom!
What to do with you, little Dororo?
Well...
So why not give me Fudo?
Dororo!
Dororo!
Dororo!
Dororo!
Dororo!
Dororo!
Dororo!
Dororo!
Why not give me Fudo?
Dororo!

I'll save you...
The End
Brother!
Brother!
Daroro!
Why have you come?
Mom!
Bring me back!
Hello!
I didn't want to tie you up! Why didn't you run away?
Stop it!
I won't let you take him away!
Get away from him!
I won't!
I promised I wouldn't leave him!
You're so small!
Darura...
You're so strong!
Darura!
Stop it!
Stop it, Hikimaru!
You've done a great job.
There's no need to destroy everything!
Is that his mother's voice?
Yes.
Give it to your mother.
No.
Umay, how are you?
Why?
Why hasn't my face changed?
Have you never seen your mother's face?
Give it to me.
Give me your face.
I've been waiting for an eternity for a face like yours.
Please stop.
Shut up.
I have to get his face.
The best face of all I've ever seen.
But why should it be the best?
Isn't it enough to have eyes, nose and mouth?
You only thought about yourself.
You turned into a monster to deceive people and turn them into faces.
Monster?
What for?
Why are you doing all this?
Think about the feelings of the people you took from their faces.
Their pain, despair, their pain.
The best face of all I've ever seen.
Why? Why?
I don't know.
How long?
How long?
How long have I...
I can't.
I can't do this anymore.
I can't.
Dorora.
Let me touch your face.
Smile.
You're so kind, Dorora.
With such a smile on your face.
As if you were a face.
Mom.
Mom.
I'm sorry, brother.
I had to be more careful.
Not only did I pull you into the front, but I reminded you of your mother.
And you're always the only one who saves me.
But I'll definitely save you when...
You're so mean.
Dorora.
I'm okay.
I'm fine.
Let's go.
What?
Hey, wait!
About that monster that's being led there.
It was a knife.
I just...
Let's go.
Let's go.
We're here, brother.
I've never been to such places before.
Don't look.
I mean, I know you can't see.
Just don't look.
All the cuts hurt.
It's so nice.
What kind of paradise is this?
You'd better not say that.
Do you think the idea of dying early is not so bad?
Monster!
So it's you, monk.
Where did you come from?
Tell me where you came from.
I've been here before you.
We seem to be ready to meet.
It's time to wash!
Wash!
Wash!
Look where you're jumping, damn it!
I'm sorry.
At this age, they're like mortars.
Don't run away, okay?
Where did you come from?
From Flea?
We haven't seen you here before.
We haven't seen you.
We're travelers.
Travelers? And where?
Where are you going?
Well...
We haven't decided yet.
Is he your brother?
He's just a brother.
Oh, what's this?
Is there something on your back?
What are you talking about?
Stop fiddling around.
Is this a map?
Map?
Yes, it's a map!
Yes, I'm telling you, it's a map!
Map!
Let me see!
Shut up! Stop looking at my back!
Come on, show me!
Enough!
Show me!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
