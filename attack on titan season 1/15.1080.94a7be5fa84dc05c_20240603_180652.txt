No more words! You have to support me!
You don't have to explain anything. You need to be trained.
So it's decided.
Eren, give the order to the intelligence.
Now they're getting ready to go outside the walls.

ATTACK OF TITANS
ATTACK OF TITANS
ATTACK OF TITANS
The night before the attack.
The elite squad.
Trost.
The former headquarters of the intelligence.
This castle used to be our headquarters.
When we got it, we remodeled it a little.
Of course, it's impressive.
But for us, the place turned out to be unsuccessful.
Too far from the walls and from the river.
There were times when we only appeared.
A lot of enthusiasm and no experience.
Lotus didn't think that we would hide you among such beauty.
Look, don't be suspicious, baby.
Sorry. I don't care if you're a titan or someone else.
And I don't understand why Captain Levis only drives like this.
There's nothing to talk about on the horse.
The main thing is to impress.
I almost put a new one in my pants.
Is it because of your stupidity?
Think about it. These are the nuances.
Tell me, you didn't always behave like that.
Listen, if you're seriously trying to imitate the captain,
then you'd better stop.
You don't look like him at all.
Do you want to abuse my free nature, Petra?
I don't remember you being my wife.
At least you once bit your tongue through the place with blood,
making yourself the hero of the winner.
Don't worry, I was also bragging about you.
Those are the fighters of the elite reconnaissance unit.
Levy's unit.
You're just ridiculous.
Petra Rao killed the titans. Seven.
She could have killed 48.
Oluo Bazard killed the titans. 39.
He could have killed 9.
Without a doubt, they are the best.
El Djin killed the titans. 14.
He could have killed 32.
Junter Schultz killed the titans. 7.
He could have killed 40.
They are the best of the reconnaissance units,
and if I don't control myself,
these people won't be able to kill me.
The grass has grown all around.
It's a complete desert.
No one has lived here for many years.
There must be dust inside.
I can't stand it.
Let's start cleaning up.
I cleaned up on the last floor.
Where should I sleep?
In the basement, where else?
The basement again?
Of course.
You can't fight for yourself.
If you suddenly turn into a titan in a dream,
the basement will easily hold you back.
This is one of the conditions
on which you were released here.
So don't mess with anyone.
I'll check the rooms.
You stay here for now.
I see you're disappointed, Eren.
What?
I'll call you Eren, like the captain.
I'm not against it.
Why do I look so disappointed?
It's not uncommon here.
What? The captain didn't seem
to be the perfect hero he was described to be?
Not tall, annoying, cruel.
It's hard to get close to him.
No, I was surprised
that he followed the orders he was given.
And you thought that if he was strong and influential,
he wouldn't pay attention to formalities?
Yes. I thought he wouldn't
allow anyone to command over him.
It looks like he was just like that.
But it's a different story.
Before he became an investigator,
he was a famous bandit in one of the capital's shacks.
And what brought him here?
I don't know.
I don't know the details.
But I heard that Irwin made an investigator out of him.
The captain?
Hey, Eren!
Cleaning is no good.
Go upstairs and start over.
So in a month we'll go
behind the walls to build support posts
and take newbies from those who studied this year.
If we have newbies...
Still, I think it's too hasty.
The current status of Eren
is only a temporary measure.
We need to show the command
that he is a savior of the universe.
Otherwise, the guard will catch us again
and...
I'll believe in this fairy tale.
You have a sharp sense of smell, Miki.
But I'm not far from you.
I'll tell you everything in due time.
We'll stay here for a few more days.
Okay.
I heard that a large trip is planned
behind the wall in a month.
And the graduates of this year will also be taken.
Is that true, Elton?
It's kind of unexpected.
As if the newcomers of a recent attack.
I'm sure the kids are still shaking from horror.
Captain, is that true?
But Irvine probably knows something
that we don't know.
It's true that the situation has changed.
I used to think that all our efforts
to get to the wall of the sea
were in vain.
But now we have hope.
I still can't believe it.
When you turn into a titan,
what do you feel, Eren?
I almost don't remember anything.
Anyway, it was a misunderstanding then.
I know that you need to heal yourself.
You bite yourself in the hand.
Stop.
How did I know?
How did I know what to do?
What's the point of asking?
He won't tell us anything
that we wouldn't read in the reports.
True, someone may not agree with this.
And he will want to get along with you.
Only if he gets carried away, you won't die for long.
Take care.
Good evening, elite squad.
How are you doing in a new place?
I'm a little early.
I didn't have the strength to wait any longer.
Commander Hange?
I didn't wait long, Eren.
I'm working on two titans
that we caught in the city.
I'd like to ask you to help me with tomorrow's experiments.
Experiments?
What should I do?
You'll like it.
You can't even imagine how much.
Yes, I'm here to obey.
I can't go where I want to go.
Levi, what's Eren doing tomorrow?
He's cleaning the yard.
That's wonderful.
Okay.
So, are you going to put some experiments on the titans?
I'm talking about some experiments...
Oh, I'd better keep quiet.
Don't ask.
Of course.
I knew right away that you'd be interested.
Well, if that's what you want to hear...
I can't help it.
Now I'll tell you...
about our boys.
We put the same experiments
on the last five titans.
Hello.
First, we checked if we could talk.
How are you?
What's your name?
Does it hurt anywhere?
You're too close.
Hello.
I'm hungry.
Wow.
Be careful, Commander.
Unfortunately, I had to admit
that communication with the titans is still impossible.
But I couldn't get rid of the titans.
I was resting with them
from everyday worries.
A long, long time ago,
there were a lot of cannibals.
I'm not talking about you right now.
There were cannibals.
They hid in caves, deep in the mountains,
and attacked the travelers who passed by.
They took everything they had,
and they ate them themselves.
25 again.
Now they're going to pay.
As a result,
they continued to starve for 25 years.
They say they robbed and ate
more than 500 people.
Perhaps even you guys didn't eat that much.
They also liked to cook them in different ways.
The back part
was put on steaks.
The hips were cut
for stew.
What's worse,
they were skewered,
mixed the minced meat and fried the cutlets.
The blood went to the blood sausage.
The liver went to the liver.
Yes, they knew how to cook.
By the way, they were different from you.
But one day,
you made a mistake by attacking us.
And we caught you.
So I want to call you by name and surname
the head of that gang.
You will be Sonya. You will be Bean.
But don't be afraid.
We won't execute you anyway.
Nice to meet you, Sonya.
Nice to meet you, Bean.
Nice to meet you, too.
In general, I called the seven-meter one Bean,
and the four-meter one Sonya.
Then we tried to isolate them from the sun.
It is known that at night the titans are frozen.
And we wanted to check
whether they get energy from the sun's rays.
Darkness affected them in different ways.
Well done, Sonya.
Good night. See you tomorrow.
Having stayed without the sun,
Sonya has already weakened in an hour.
And you don't like to sleep until late, Bean.
Well, it's okay. I'll sit with you.
But Bean stayed active for three hours.
But Bean stayed active for three hours.
But Bean stayed active for three hours.
And again I was shocked.
They don't eat, they don't drink.
They have a mouth and a nose,
but they don't need to breathe.
They only need one sun.
And if we deprive them of it for a long time,
I really wanted to know.
But it would be bad to torture them to death.
But it would be bad to torture them to death.
We accidentally killed the previous two.
We accidentally grabbed a piece of their neck
when we tried to cut their heads off.
They were so cute and smiling.
I was very sorry for them.
I don't want to be so sad anymore.
Honestly.
And then we started hurting them.
We wanted to know if they hurt and how much.
We wanted to know if they hurt and how much.
Commander, you don't have to shout.
How can I not shout?
Look how Bean is suffering.
Bean, be a man.
Bean, be a man.
We had to find out if the Titans
had vulnerable places besides the neck.
My heart was bleeding.
Sony, look.
The spear went straight into the heart.
Does it hurt? What do you feel?
Unlike Bean, Sony was closed
and silent.
What? What's going on?
Commander, step back!
Sony, you bastard!
Someday you won't be lucky.
In general, Sony is not bad at expressing his feelings.
But I have a cherished desire to bite my head off.
Tell me, Hangi,
how can you talk so carelessly about the Titans?
They almost destroyed us.
They are like predators to us.
You have seen a thousand times what they are capable of.
You are right.
Many of my friends were killed by the Titans right in front of me.
And I was brought here
by hatred and thirst for revenge.
But one day
something amazing happened to me.
I hit the head of a three-meter Titan
and it flew off like a ball.
It was light, too light,
like their bodies.
It is not clear how something so huge
can stand and even walk on two feet.
I decided to check again.
I cut off the Titan's hand.
It was also very light.
I heard when you turned into a Titan,
your body seemed to have grown out of the air.
I suspect
that in the case of the Titans,
our eyes deceive us very much
and they are not quite as we see them.
For many decades in the fight against the Titans,
only hatred moved us.
I want to try to look at them
from a slightly different angle.
Perhaps it will not give anything.
But still, I will try.
Since I joined the intelligence,
I have not stopped being surprised.
Not only because of her,
but also because of others.
Sometimes it seems
as if I were in a crazy house.
But they...
They are like no one
trying to change something.
Hange!
I would like to know more about your experiments.
Really?
Yes. I think it will help me tomorrow
when you will put new ones.
Perhaps.
Well, okay. I have missed a lot of things.
I can tell you more,
but it will take a long time.
The first time I caught a living Titan,
I expected this.
In general,
we did not learn anything new from these experiments.
And what I told you
you still had to pass as a cadet.
You remember all this, don't you?
Yes. I remember everything from the beginning to the end.
Okay. Now I'll start from the beginning,
but maybe it's not worth it.
First of all, the titans...
Commander Hange, are you here?
Our subcontractors! Both titans are killed!
Sony!
I do not believe it!
We got them with great difficulty!
Do you think they are soldiers?
Yes, but we do not know who yet.
Both were killed before dawn at the same time.
When the watchmen noticed,
they turned on the maneuvering drives and hid.
So there were two or more of them.
Sony!
Look what a sight! Hange is going crazy!
I do not understand.
Let's go. Now the guard will take care of this.
Got it?
What do you see?
Who do you think is our enemy?
Sorry.
It's probably a strange question.
I do not understand.
I do not understand.
I do not understand.
I do not understand.
I do not understand.
I do not understand.
I do not understand.
I do not understand.
I do not understand.
I do not understand.

I do not understand.
I do not understand.
I do not understand.
I do not understand.
I do not understand.
I do not understand.
I do not understand.
I do not understand.
I do not understand.
Sony raises the pressure.
I do not understand.
Sony raises the pressure.
The 104th Infantry Troops hold their own feelings in their hearts and wish for the choice of their own troops.
