        <pre>The year is 850, the city of Trost.
Eren Yeager awakened an unknown power and turned into a giant.
The scared allies of the weapon decided to destroy him.
Who am I? I am a human!
He is not an enemy of humanity!
He wants to help us!
Let them kill me now! I will not back down!
I believe that his power will help us!
The guys, who unsuccessfully proved their innocence, saved Dot Pixis, the commander of the southern territories.
I think we should listen to what the children want to say.

Fall of the throne!
I will do it! I don't know if I will be able to close the hole, but I will do everything in my power!
Well said! A real man!
Report to the headquarters! We are starting the operation!
What? We haven't checked yet! Will he be able to do it? Why start the operation?
Maybe it's stupid, but there's no point in dragging and doubting.
Probably, Commander Pixis sees what we don't see with you.
What we don't see?
There is one question that needs to be answered before we start the operation.
Commander Pixis understands this very well.
What do you mean?
Our enemies are not only giants.
Time is running out!
It's time to act, young soldiers!
They want to return the throne!
It can't be! They won't be able to fix the wall!
What does the leadership think?
If we can't fix the wall, sooner or later everyone will be eaten!
A curse! They just want to stand out!
Yes! I'll get there again!
No! I don't want to die!
I don't want to die! I want to see my family!
Das! Don't shout so loud!
Who is shouting? I heard everything!
Are you refusing to carry out the mission?
No! I refuse! This plan is pointless! We will not achieve anything and die!
You betrayed our army! You betrayed humanity!
Do you know that I can execute you right here?
Let me go!
It's a hundred times better than being eaten by giants!
Calm down! Let me go!
I'm not going to die voluntarily!
Do you hear?
I understand him perfectly!
You know, maybe we should try to raise the rebellion?
I would like to choose how to die myself!
And you?
We're just kidding!
This is as loud as possible so that everyone can hear!
There are also many dissatisfied among the defenders of the wall!
And when the noise rises, we will run away!
If you run away, where will you go?
I'm going to meet my daughter!
Anyway, this wall will soon fall!
They say that before the giants took over the earth, people could not find common language with each other
and constantly waged bloody wars.
And at that time, someone thought,
if humanity has a dangerous enemy,
then it will become one and stop the wars!
What do you think about this idea?
This is the first time I hear such a theory!
I think it's pretty stupid, I even want to make fun of it!
Your thinking is not standard, like mine!
Today the giants drove us into the cell of the city walls!
But I can't say that humanity is one!
Yes, it's time for us to get our minds together!
After all, it's not easy to fight the giants!
Eren!
Are you alive?
Don't get distracted by work!
No, he's a scoundrel!
I'm older than his rank!
If he's alive, then Mikasa and Armin are probably the same!
It's strange!
What is he talking about?
Help yourself!
Thank you!
Kill him!
We'll all die anyway!
This is the last warning!
Attention!
Now I will explain to you the details of the operation to free Trost!
Its main goal will be to close the hole formed at the place of the broken gates!
Close?
How?
First, let me introduce you to this young soldier!
He's still a cadet!
Eren Jager!
Eren?
Thanks to our secret research, he can turn into a giant at will!
He can form the body of a giant and control it according to his will!
Sabagas!
I don't understand what the commander-in-chief is talking about!
Is it because I'm a fool?
Shut up a little, fool!
He will turn into a giant, take a huge stone lying near the main gates, bring it to the broken gates and close the gap!
Your task is to accompany him when he pulls the stone and protect him from the giants!
You don't have to fight the giants?
Excuse me, I'm a cadet and I shouldn't tell you!
It doesn't matter, continue!
Yes!
Usually, giants attack large groups of people.
We can use this to lure them to one part of the wall.
So we can, without entering the battle, take all the giants away from Eren.
And we can destroy the gathered giants with the help of artillery to minimize losses.
However, Eren cannot be left without protection at all.
He must be protected by a small elite detachment.
In addition, giants coming out of the hole will attack him.
This detachment will also fight them.
I see.
We need to think about it.
The whole operation is based on the fact that Eren can lift the stone, bring it to the wall and close the gap.
Of course, we can't be 100% sure that everything will turn out as we thought.
Indeed, we should not risk the lives of our soldiers if we are not sure about the performance of the main part of the plan.
I understand what the chief commander thinks.
Yes, we have no time.
Even now, the giants continue to fill our city.
If there are too many of them, we will never be able to return the rope.
In addition, the probability of breaking through the wall of the rose will increase.
And one more thing.
After a while, people will no longer be able to fight fear.
To break that huge stone?
That's right.
People began to rule the giants?
I don't believe it!
I don't want to risk my life for something I don't understand!
Zahal, you're holding us back!
After all, we are not the cannon fodder that can be sacrificed!
Is it turning into a titan?
It's inflating!
I don't believe it!
They are sending us to death!
I'm leaving!
Me too!
Me too!
Wait for me!
Stop, traitors!
Do you want to die?
I want to spend the last days with my family!
That's bad.
Yes.
We won't have an army like that.
Are you ready to die, traitors?
I'll execute you right here!
I order you!
Let go of the soldiers who want to leave!
The one who gave in to his fear is not worthy of fighting the giants!
If you can't fight your fear, get out of here!
If you want your relatives, parents or children to know this fear,
if you want your loved ones to go through the same thing, get out of here!
I can't!
This is my daughter!
My last hope!
Let's remember how we tried to fight off Maria's wall four years ago.
However, I think you understand everything without me.
We called it the operation to return the wall,
but in fact, the government simply got rid of the extra mouths.
But then none of you resented,
because thanks to the fact that we kicked them out of the wall,
we ourselves could continue to live inside these walls.
The fault for this sin lies on me and on all of you.
The uprising did not explode because there were not so many refugees from Maria's wall.
But what will happen this time?
If the giants break through the rose wall,
we will not take 20% of the population.
The territories behind the wall will not feed even half of us.
If humanity dies, it is not thanks to the fact that the giants will eat it.
We will kill each other fighting for food.
We must not die in the fight for a piece of bread.
It is much better to part with life in battle.
I don't know if I can lift that stone with the help of the power of the giants,
but I clearly realize what I have to do.
Maybe we are lying to ourselves, but it doesn't matter.
I have to close the hole.
I have to give hope to this city and to all of humanity.
In order to maneuver, a person needs equipment
with which he can evenly distribute the weight.
The equipment for maneuvering is made extremely light
so as not to slow down the speed of a person.
This is your brigade.
You have only one task.
To protect Eren Yeager.
To eliminate any problems that may arise.
This is a very dangerous and very responsible task.
It will not be an exaggeration to say that the fate of all of humanity depends on you today.
Can I ask you one question?
I'm listening.
Will your soldier really be able to turn into a giant?
Shut up!
But you also doubt it.
Commander, this whole plan is based on a factor that we cannot be sure of.
If it doesn't turn into a giant, many soldiers will die in vain.
What a surprise!
I didn't expect you to want to lose to giants so much.
I don't like to lose.
I don't like anything else in the world.
However, since I was born, I have been constantly losing.
I want to defeat giants.
No matter what, I want to defeat these stupid bastards.
Commander, we all want to defeat them.
Then you have to believe in him.
He is really an unknown factor, as you said.
But he is our only chance at victory.
Commander Pixis, it's time to start.
Yes.
Jan Dittrich.
Rico Branska.
Mitabe Yernaha.
Among the wall defenders, you are the best warriors.
The fate of humanity is in your hands.
Stop!
Jan, you are the brigade commander.
You will make decisions on the spot.
Are you sure?
I don't mind.
Me too.
But there are smarter fighters here than me.
Don't worry.
You understand the taste of sake.
Its sweetness and bitterness, you feel it all.
Good luck.
I'm glad to try.
Eren, I'm sorry.
As a result of my negotiations, you were saved.
Remember what I said?
You have the talent to determine the right path.
I believe in you.
Eren, I'll go.
I won't stop you.
You will be in the squad that will be the bait.
But I can't leave you alone.
Or you will...
Enough!
I'm not your little brother, and I'm not your child.
I already said.
Ackerman!
I'll take you to our squad.
We need your skills.
Let's go.
The operation begins.
Jan, take care of yourself.
Eren, you too.
Do you have our secret weapon?
The main thing is that you close the hole.
We will protect you.
Good luck.
Eren, how do you feel?
Good.
Eren.
I feel good.
Much better than when we aimed.
Don't get distracted on the mission.
What do you say?
I didn't expect that the future of humanity would depend on one child.
Stop talking.
We will soon come to the stone.
I can't see the giants yet.
Probably the soldiers distracted them.
Did you hear?
We lure them to the outskirts of the city.
Don't go into battle.
Jäger, listen.
Most likely, a lot of soldiers will die in this operation.
They will die for you.
These are our classmates, friends and just acquaintances.
Of course, they are all soldiers and ready to die.
And they are not just faceless victims of this operation.
Wait.
It's too early.
Wait.
They have names and families.
And they risk their lives for them.
Alyosha.
Dominic.
Finn.
Isabella.
Ludwig.
Martina.
Kit.
Hans.
Each of them is a living person.
And with many of them, we sat at the same table.
Today, many of these soldiers will die for you to have a chance.
You have a great responsibility.
You have to make sure that their deaths are not in vain.
Whatever happens, never forget about it.
Die, but do your duty.
I will close this hole.
Let it be the price of my own life.
Since the giants appeared, humanity has never defeated them.
The giants conquered territories, and humanity hid further and further, leaving their lands to them.
However, if this operation succeeds,
humanity will for the first time win back the territory given to the giants.
We will drive them out of our land.
Here, jump.
Today will be the day of the first victory of humanity over the giants.
I see green smoke.
The resistance squad has begun to act.
Compared to the fact that the giants took away humanity for all this time,
this victory will seem insignificant.
Well, let it be.
This small step will be the first step of humanity to victory over the giants.
If you take the proportions of people,
then a person would never be able to lift such a stone.
There is strength in the army.
He can do it.
He can do it.
He can do it.
He can do it.
He can do it.
He can do it.
He can do it.
He can do it.
He can do it.
There is such a stone.
There is strength in the army.
He can lead everyone.
Eren.
The continuation follows.
The end.
The end.
The end.
The end.
The end.
The end.
The end.
The end.
The end.
The end.
The end.
The end.
The end.
The End.
While many soldiers were dying,
Eren, who had become a titan, ran away and destroyed his own head.
The operation seemed to have failed.
