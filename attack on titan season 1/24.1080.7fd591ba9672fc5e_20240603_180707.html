        <pre>Armin, I'm glad that you thought I was a good person, and you managed to trick me, but it doesn't matter, because my battle will begin now!
We found out who the Titan woman is. Her name is...
Ani!
Armin!
Armin!
Attack of the Titans
Battle of Stahesse. Mercy.
A few days earlier.
How long have they been here?
Where are they?
I'm nervous.
Are they going to stay here until we are arrested?
And the Titan woman has disappeared somewhere in the last time.
And you are very talkative today.
What nonsense. I'm always talkative.
I'm sorry. If I had made the right choice that day, this wouldn't have happened.
I told you, you can't predict the result.
Sorry for being late.
No.
Guys...
What?
Maybe we know who the Titan woman is.
This time we will catch her.
The operation is scheduled for the day after tomorrow.
The location of the Stahesse city, on the territory of which we will pass.
This is our first and last chance.
If the operation fails, we will have to give it to Aaron.
It will be more difficult to fight against the destroyers of the wall.
Humanity and our step will come to an end.
For us and you, this is a great opportunity.
The plan is this.
When we pass the Stahesse, Aaron will be bait and lure the target into this tunnel.
If she goes down to the very bottom, then according to our calculations,
we will be able to immobilize her, even if she turns.
But if she doesn't go down and becomes a Titan, Aaron, you'll have to fight.
Yes.
Are you sure that our goal is in the city of Stahesse?
Yes.
She serves in the Royal Guard.
The Guard?
It was Armin who figured it out.
The Titan woman.
She killed two of our captured Titans.
There is a possibility that she is one of your classmates.
Wait a minute.
She is our classmate?
It can't be.
We suspect that the Titan woman is...
Wait a minute.
Annie.
Leonhart.
We are late.
She put on the ring back then.
She probably suspected me from the very beginning.
She guessed that there was an ambush here.
My plan was not good enough.
You will regret it later.
Now tell me what to do.
Meet the third brigade and get to the surface.
Then we'll move on to the reserve plan.
We will fight the Titan woman.
Aaron, you will turn into a giant and help us catch her.
Got it?
Yes.
Hey!
The third brigade.
Did you manage to catch her?
We failed.
Let's move on to the reserve plan.
She crushed the roof.
We need to help her.
Aaron, step back.
Mikasa, let her go.
Apparently, this time she just wants to kill you.
She's taking a risk.
She hoped that she would not crush Aaron.
It seems that our situation is very difficult.
Annie will not stop before anything to get Aaron.
What to do?
The path back is destroyed.
And on the Maneuvers, we will jump right into her hands.
From the other side.
If we stay here, sooner or later she will crush us.
It's okay.
I'll deal with her.
Like the time when I protected you from the core.
Come to me.
I'm turning.
Stay close.
I can't turn again.
Why?
The most important moment.
It hurts.
You can't turn into a giant if you don't see the goal clearly.
Imagine what you have to do.
You can't turn into a giant if you don't see the goal clearly.
You can't turn into a giant if you don't see the goal clearly.
Imagine what you have to do.
I can imagine.
It doesn't work.
Aaron.
Tell me honestly.
You don't want to fight her?
Aaron?
Do you still think that it's some kind of mistake and that Annie is not a Titan woman?
You just saw how she turned.
She killed your friends.
Do you still doubt it?
Shut up!
I'm trying my best!
Annie is a Titan woman?
But why?
Why did you think so, Armin?
The Titan woman knew how you looked from the very beginning.
Besides, I noticed her reaction when she heard your name.
A snack for giants.
But most importantly, I'm sure that it was Annie who killed Soune and Bina.
Those two giants.
How do you know that?
To kill them, you had to act very carefully.
The criminal was supposed to use his maneuvering drive.
We checked the drives.
But they didn't suspect.
At the inspection, Annie showed the drive to Marco.
That's why she wasn't suspected.
What are you talking about?
What does Marco have to do with it?
I don't know.
Maybe you were wrong?
No.
I remember that drive.
Stop talking.
I've heard it all.
Is there any other evidence?
No.
Annie's face looks like the face of the Titan.
What?
The face looks like it.
That's not evidence.
The absence of evidence doesn't change anything.
No evidence.
Then why do you need all this?
What if Annie has nothing to do with it?
Why would she suspect you?
It wouldn't look good to her.
But anyway, if we don't do anything,
the crowd will just bring you to the victim.
We shouldn't suspect Annie.
Eren, don't you remember anything when you heard Annie's name?
When you fought the Titan in the forest,
didn't you notice that she fought in her own style, Annie?
You understand, don't you?
That in fact, Annie is the woman of the Titan.
So we have to fight her.
Or maybe she has a special place in your heart.
I've come up with a plan.
Mikasa and I will jump out of two exits at the same time.
Annie will definitely chase one of us.
And you will get out where Annie isn't.
Wait a second.
One of you can die.
If we stay here, we'll all die.
Mikasa, get ready.
I'm ready.
Mikasa!
Armin!
How can you?
How can you fight our friend?
How?
We have no choice.
This world is very cruel.
To survive behind the wall of the top,
you need special citizenship.
You can get such citizenship by serving in the Guard or the reconnaissance squad.
Eren!
Eren!
Eren! Eren! I'll save you!
Hurry up! Wake up!
Eren! Eren!
Eren! Eren!
Eren! Eren!
Eren!
Don't let her escape!
We must not let her out of the city!
What happened there?
Escort! Go and see what's going on there!
Yes, sir!
Strange...
I think something exploded there...
Nile!
Raise all the troops!
A giant has appeared in the city!
That can't be!
We are behind the wall of the train!
The giants will never get through here!
Wait!
Jäger, don't move!
It's time to stop this stupid masquerade!
And don't even think of calling me stupid again!
Commander, I'll go too!
Take the equipment in the fourth squad!
Yes, sir!
I'm glad you're so eager to fight, but the main thing is to survive!
Yes, sir!
Erwin!
As you wish!
Commander!
Take it!
Thank you!
Erwin!
Everyone who's not capable, follow me!
We need to catch the Titan woman!
Erwin!
Wait!
Your actions may be regarded as resisting the royal power!
Nile!
Do you have any gray substance in your head at all?
You don't even understand what's going on!
Erwin!
Erwin!
Take off the maneuvering device!
The giants!
The giants attacked!
Look!
There's a giant there!
It can't be!
Step back!
Why are they chilling there?
On the other hand, I myself dreamed of becoming a guard.
And where did my dream go?
Damn it!
Don't try to kill her!
You only need to hurt her!
It's useless!
She will predict all our movements!
It's okay!
I won't give up so easily!
Erwin!
Answer me!
Erwin!
Armin!
What are you doing?
Jean!
Erwin is dead!
What?
But he was supposed to become a giant!
He couldn't turn into one!
He can't accept that Annie is a Titan woman!
What?
We have to get him out!
We have to get him out!
We have to get him out!
We have to get him out!
What?
We have to get him out!
Jean!
Help me!
He couldn't turn into one?
Eren!
Are you kidding us?
You knew we were counting on you!
We trusted you with the destiny of our lives!
We trusted you with everything we had!
Is this your gratitude for our trust?
Marco!
Marco!
Marco!
Marco!
We're all here!
Eren!
Eren!
Eren!
Eren...
Nothing can be changed.
If you want to defeat the monster,
I'm ready to give up humanity.
I'm sure Annie can sacrifice.
I don't know why she does it,
but the winner is the one who is ready to give everything for victory.
Annie!
This time you have to kill me!
Or your threat to start the fight was just a promise!
Armin, come here!
I'm coming!
She's coming!
Commander, it's scary to look at your face!
Armin!
Great!
I thought my plan to capture the giants was not relevant.
I'm so grateful to Irwin!
So...
Be a good girl and lie down peacefully.
This time you won't be able to call the giants to eat your body like that time.
But don't worry.
I'll eat you instead of them.
I'll gnaw all the information out of you.
She's free!
There are too few traps!
Don't let her get away!
The one who is not ready to sacrifice anything
will not be able to change anything!
Yes, he's right.
You've lost.
You've lost your friendship and your faith in people.
Remember!
I'll kill all of you!
No! I'll destroy you!
I don't have time to think if this is right or not!
I have to move!
I won't let it end like this!
Get up!
Our world is cruel!
What this time?
I'll kill all of you!
I won't let it end like this!
I won't let it end like this!
I won't let it end like this!
I won't let it end like this!
I won't let it end like this!
I won't let it end like this!
I won't let it end like this!
I won't let it end like this!
I won't let it end like this!
I won't let it end like this!
I won't let it end like this!
I won't let it end like this!
I won't let it end like this!
I won't let it end like this!
I won't let it end like this!
I won't let it end like this!
I won't let it end like this!
I was also interested in this demon
I would like to play it
Good game
I'm also interested in this essence
Yes, 않
But
Will I be able to gather my heart?
Someone's calling voice
Changed into my ears
It seems that the time has stopped
Come on, wake up
Deep darkness, I want to get out
I ran away like a fast train
We were like living corpses
Let's meet again outside the wall
In a place without a map
I will destroy the titans from this world
That day, the anger that I instilled in the young Eren will hunt him down
Destroy everything in this world
