More than a hundred years ago, humanity had enemies.
The difference in power between them and us was too great.
Humanity was on the verge of extinction.
To protect them, the survivors built three huge walls,
Mary, Rose and Shinn.
They lived their lives in peace.
However...
Chitano attack!
Chitano attack!
Chitano attack!
Chitano attack!

Mary, Rose and Shinn
Shigenshina declined.
Shigenshina Day
Our evil desires and bad deeds angered the Lord, and He sent a punishment to humanity.
Now we understand what a cruel punishment awaits us.
Our vile earthly passions have inflicted a heavenly punishment on us, which will purify our souls and destroy our bodies.
There can be no more bitter revenge than what is happening in this city right now!
No! Let me go! Let me go!
Let me go! Let me go!
God! Everything came from You! Everything will return to You!
Our flesh will be eaten by giants and will return to Earth again!
Tell us! Tell us what to do now!
Lord, we will all return to You!
What are you fighting for?
Just a little more and we would have saved my mother!
Why did you take us away?
Just a little more and we would have...
Calm down already!
Eren!
Eren!
Eren!
Eren!
You couldn't save your mother because you were too weak.
And I... I couldn't fight that giant because I was too cowardly!
Forgive me.
And again...
Everything is repeating itself.
Hurry! To the inner gates!
We will save ourselves from Shiganshina by water!
On the ships!
Hurry! Until everyone is eaten!
The cities like Shiganshina, located between the walls of Mary and the Rose, were the most vulnerable in the event of an attack.
They were supposed to contain the advance of the giants in a daze.
The inhabitants of Shiganshina began to hunt the giants, which was inevitable.
They were supposed to stop the advance of the giants in a daze.
They were supposed to stop the advance of the giants in a daze.
You throw your things away! We can take more people!
Armin, sit down.
But I still don't see Eren and Mikasa.
Here they are!
Eren!
Eren!
Eren!
Eren!
Eren!
Eren!
Eren!
Eren!
Eren!
Eren!
Eren!
Here they are!
Eren!
Leave him!
They probably lost a lot today.
What are you digging?
Move!
What about the guns?
No!
Stop!
They're close!
I don't believe it.
It couldn't have happened.
Lord, help us.
Please, Lord.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Let us in!
We can't, the ship is overflowing.
Please, take at least my child.
I'm sorry, you can't.
Get out of here!
Stop!
Take us!
Idiot!
Where are you going?
We weren't taught to shoot giants when we were in school.
Nobody cares about your excuses.
Reload the gun!
I can't.
The gate is closing.
The gate is closing.
The gate is closing.
The gate is closing.
The gate is closing.
The gate is closing.
The gate is closing.
The gate is closing.
They're locking us here.
I'm leaving.
Stop!
Don't let the gate down.
Wait.
There are still many people left in the city.
If they break through these gates,
it won't be limited to the destruction of our city.
Humanity will be forced to leave forever for the second wall.
So what?
Are you going to bring all these people to their death?
Hurry up!
Don't close the gate!
The giants are coming!
Let the gate down!
Stop!
What is it?
What does it want?
Shoot!
It's not working!
What's wrong with it?
We're retreating!
We're retreating!
The giants are coming!
They will hurt the gate!
Hurry up!
Let them down!
Let them down!
The gates are broken.
The gates are broken.
A few hours later
A few hours after the fall of Shiganshina and the break of the wall of the sea,
the news of this event spread to all human cities.
Is that true?
The giants captured Shiganshina?
I can't believe it.
The wall has been standing for a hundred years.
You may not believe it, but the ship with the refugees is an unconditional fact.
It is said that 500 people are sailing on it.
The main thing is that other circles are not affected.
But the giants couldn't get into the territory behind the wall of the sea.
We need to contact the capital and agree on our actions.
The situation is extraordinary.
We can't deal with it ourselves.
Excuse me!
I received a message.
The wall of the sea is broken and the giants are coming through it.
This is the end.
It's all over.
Sooner or later we will all be eaten.
The end.
We don't have it at home anymore.
We have nowhere to go back to.
Why?
Why?
Why did I have to fight with her all my life?
I can't see her anymore.
Now there is no more.
Why?
You were too weak to save her.
I'm weak.
People are weak.
I'm weak.
People are weak.
They can only cry about their losses.
I will destroy them all.
Eren, what's wrong with you?
Eren!
Eren!
I will destroy them all.
I will destroy them all.
I will destroy them all.
Eren!
That year the central government decided to reduce the area of people's living to the border of the wall of the Rose.
By that time the giants had eaten about 10,000 people.
Eren.
Eren.
Karura.
Mikasa.
I hope you are alive.
Eren!
Eren!
Eren!
Father!
Stop it, please!
What are you doing?
Are you coming with me?
Now give me your hand!
No!
You became strange after your mother died!
Come on!
Father, let me go!
No!
You are not suitable!
What are you talking about?
Don't forget about the key!
You have to find it!
You shouldn't forget about the key until you find the truth!
Eren.
Are you all right?
You had a nightmare.
I think I saw my father.
No.
It was a dream.
I see.
Let's go.
Food will be delivered soon.
Food will be delivered soon.
They told me that food will be delivered here.
And here they gather everyone who sailed on the ship.
Hey!
Get up, Votchevich!
Shut up!
I haven't eaten anything since yesterday.
We survived, but we can't survive.
Eren!
Mikasa!
Armin!
Look!
We made it!
Grandfather said that he had three children and they gave us food.
Thank you.
What is he?
You can't do anything.
There are enough people living in this district.
This is the daily ration.
There are too many refugees.
There was not enough food here before.
And now they need to feed those who have evacuated.
Let go!
Why should we give them our food?
Since the giants broke through the wall,
it would be better if they ate more of these refugees.
Eren!
Now we will have a constant shortage of food.
What are you doing, scoundrel?
You don't know anything.
You're talking about what you haven't seen.
You haven't seen how the giants eat people.
Shut up!
Forgive us.
He's just too hungry.
He's too cold.
That's why he wanted to offend you, gentlemen.
Please, forgive us.
Here it begins.
You don't die of hunger just because you eat less.
Children should also understand this and be grateful.
Yes!
Damn it!
No one needs your donations.
I will definitely return to the wall of Mary
and destroy all the giants.
Eren, are you kidding me?
I'm not kidding.
I'm not like them.
I will not hide all my life.
I don't need this bread.
Eren, you will die of hunger.
Aren't you offended?
We will not defeat the giants until we are so pathetic.
It's impossible.
We will not win.
We have no other choice but to live behind the wall.
And if we fight, we will die like my father and mother.
And that's why you're offering to shoot them with your tail?
Aren't you ashamed?
Now we have no other way out.
It's just an excuse.
Don't live under Jeff's tail like a cowardly domestic animal.
Mikasa?
If you are weak, then we are the same as Eren.
We were helped to escape from the giants and leave the city.
We wouldn't have been able to do it ourselves.
And today we were sacrificed food.
Such weak people like us cannot defeat even one giant.
As your mother used to say,
the most important thing for us is to survive.
Mikasa!
Eat.
We have to survive.
I won't let you die of hunger.
In order to increase the supply of food,
most refugees were sent to agricultural work.
But there was still not enough food.
Therefore, for the next year, the central government
sent most of the refugees to beat the wall of Maria against the giants.
250,000 people.
It was the fifth part of the refugees.
Only a few hundred survived.
Thanks to their sacrifice,
those who survived for some time
got rid of the problem of lack of food.
It's all because of the giants.
If we can defeat them,
we will be able to return our home.
Armin!
I will enter the military school.
I will learn to fight the giants.
Me too.
Armin!
Me too!
I'm with you.
Mikasa!
It's not necessary.
The main thing is to survive.
Yes.
I'm going to stop you from dying.
I see.
So we're three.
Today, the 104th ceremony of the entry begins.
You are the samples of society.
From this day on, I am responsible for you.
Shadis! Shadis!
Do not hope for a warm meeting.
Now you are an ordinary scum
who can only make food for the giants.
You are even worse than a scum.
But you, besters, came to me.
And in three years, I got rid of you.
And my science will be cruel.
In three years, you will rise before the giants.
You will be just food
or an iron wall that will protect our king
or soldiers of humanity that will drive away the giants.
Decide for yourself.
I have decided.
I will destroy the giants.
I will destroy all the giants.
Without exception.
The continuation follows.
THE END
THE END
