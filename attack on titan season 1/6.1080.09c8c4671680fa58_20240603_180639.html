Battle for Thorns
World in children's eyes
Armin! What's wrong with you?
Wake up!
Armin! Armin!
Come on! Come on!
Are you awake?
How are you?
Are you hurt?
Where are the rest of you?
Ours?
Please, wake up!
Why are you alone?
What are you doing here?
What is this?
What happened here?
I'd rather die!
Calm down, Armin!
Where is everyone?
You won't understand, Coney.
They were all killed.
Except for him.
Shut up!
Armin didn't say that!
Look around!
What's the point of wasting time on him?
Why did he survive alone?
Who knows?
Maybe the Titans decided that he was already dead.
There were several of them at once.
The guys were unlucky.
It's a pity that Eren and the others died,
and this snot saved them.
Listen, don't be angry with me.
Or I'll shut your mouth right now!
Stop it, both of you!
We all have to do something!
Our friends die one after the other!
It doesn't matter!
Good job, Christa!
If it weren't for the task,
I would have fallen in love with you!
Yes, indeed.
Her outputs cross the border.
But still,
I won't let you down here.
Can you get up, Armin?
I'm sorry to have disturbed everyone.
I'll go to Rearguard.
Wait, Armin!
Let's go, Kony!
We are ordered to move forward!
I'm in hell.
Yes, I've always been in hell.
But I didn't understand it.
The world has always been hell.
The strong eat the weak.
The world doesn't even hide it.
But my friends in this world,
they tried to be strong
and helped me, the weak.
It made me angry.
I was helpless and helpless for them.
I wanted to be strong like them
and live in this world with them
on equal terms.
And that's how it ended.
Erwin died because of me.
Hanna!
What are you doing?
Armin, help me!
Franz isn't breathing!
I'm trying to revive him!
Reanimate him!
It doesn't help!
Armin, help me!
Franz isn't breathing!
I'm trying to revive him!
Reanimate him!
It doesn't help!
Armin, help me!
Franz isn't breathing!
I'm trying to revive him!
It doesn't help!
Franz!
Hanna, it's dangerous down there.
Get on the roof!
I won't leave him!
Can't you see?
Franz is gone.
God, I can't take it anymore.
I can't see anything.
That's enough.
I can't take it anymore.
Listen!
Do you even understand what we're in?
Of course I do.
That's why I'm getting out of here.
You don't want to die here.
Help me!
Are you out of your mind?
The train won't get through there.
First we have to let the people through.
They're going to eat us all.
What are you looking at?
Arrest them!
Just try it.
I'm the head of the guild here.
Do you think they're feeding you with their money?
Or are you going to provide for the whole garrison?
Help me push!
You're going to earn your whole life in this train.
Who's going to help me?
I'm going to pay!
Don't be afraid.
Dad's going to shoot from the cannon and stop the titans.
Mom!
Look!
Push!
Push if life is expensive!
What the hell?
Why isn't he distracted?
He's a runaway!
You can guess for a long time.
He's so fast!
We're the best here.
We won't catch up to him anyway.
We won't make it.
What the hell is going on here?
Great!
Let's make an intrusion!
Let them help!
I'm going to pay!
My friends are dying there now.
They're going to die against the titans.
So that these people can be taken out.
So what?
Sacrificing yourself to protect someone else's life and wallet?
That's your job, Dormaede!
Think about it!
Once in a hundred years you've done something and you're already special!
If you think that taking and dying for someone is like spitting,
then perhaps you can guess whose noble death will save many people right now.
Try it!
I've known your boss for a long time!
One of my words is over!
The dead won't say a single word!
Wait!
Boss!
Turn around!
We're saved!
Thank you, auntie!
You saved us!
I don't know how to thank you.
I'm impressed!
I saw you at the
I'm impressed, Ackerman. Well done.
Thank you.
However, I was in a hurry and damaged the blade during the strike.
Next time I will be more careful.
I'm afraid to imagine what you've been through until today.
However, it doesn't matter.
Why did I suddenly remember this?
Done!
Mom, look!
You're such a good girl, Mikasa.
Very beautiful.
This pattern has been passed on to many generations in our family.
When you have children, you will teach them how to embroider it.
Where do children come from?
Well, you'd better ask your dad.
Where does your dad come from?
Actually, I don't know myself.
You'd better ask Dr. Yeager.
He's just coming to us.
Here he is.
Coming!
Mikasa?
Yes.
You're the same age as her.
There are no other children living in this area.
So be nice to her.
First, let's see if she's nicer.
That's why you still have only one friend.
What about them?
They're not at home.
Mr. Ackerman!
It's me, Yeager.
Excuse me.
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
Dad!
It's too late.
Eren!
Have you seen the girl Mikasa nearby?
I haven't.
I see.
I'll go to the guard.
They'll look for her.
Wait for me at the foot of the mountain.
Eren!
Eren!
Hey, what if nobody buys her?
Then we shouldn't have killed her parents.
Look at her face.
She's angry, but she's still young.
Not in my taste.
I don't care about your taste.
She's an Asian.
People used to have different races.
She's the last of the kind who came to hide behind the walls
from an area called Asia.
We'll take her to the black market in the capital and sell her.
The other Asians are dead.
Some pervert will pay a lot for her.
Her dad wasn't an Asian, so she's not pure-blooded.
That's right.
Who really was worth something was her mom.
And you, she threatened to kill you.
It's not her fault, she got into a fight.
Are you kidding me?
Doctor, we've been waiting for you.
I'm sorry for the intrusion.
Just move, or I'll break your head.
Who the hell are you?
Mikasa, run!
Mikasa!
Mom!
Mikasa!
Run now!
Mikasa!
Mom!
Mikasa!
Mom!
Mikasa!
Run now!
But, dad...
Dad...
That's it, she asked for it.
Are you mad?
I told you, let's get rid of him!
But she got mad at me.
Don't think about it, okay?
Grab the girl.
Look, I'm not stupid.
Otherwise, that's it.
It's cold.
I'm sorry.
Who are you, kid?
What do you want?
Well, I got lost in the woods and saw your house.
So I came in and...
You can't do that.
Children are dangerous.
You can't do that.
You can't do that.
Children are dangerous.
You can't do that.
You can't do that.
Children are dangerous.
You can't do that.
Children are dangerous.
You can't do that.
But don't be afraid.
But don't be afraid.
Thank you, uncle.
I get it now.
I get it now.
Die, you fool!
Die, you fool!
What are you doing?
Stop, you little shit!
Bastards!
Die!
Die!
Get yours!
What are you going to do?
Don't get any closer!
Don't be afraid.
It's okay.
Don't be afraid.
It's okay.
Are you Mikasa?
I'm Eren.
Son of Dr. Yeager.
You probably remember my father.
You probably remember my father.
We went in today to see you.
We went in today to see you.
What the hell is going on?
There were three of them.
Is that you, you bastard?
Did you kill them?
You? Yes?
I'll kill you!
I'll strangle you, you bastard!
Boris!
Boris!
You'll surrender to death!
To victory!
To life!
Damn bastard!
You've completely lost your fear!
You won't fight!
You won't win!
Son of a bitch!
I can't!
And then
I remembered
how I saw it
over and over
over and over
over and over
over and over
over and over
I saw it so often
I saw it so often
but
I pretended
that I didn't notice
Yes
Our world
is cruel
And then
I stopped trembling
From that moment
I was able to control myself
I felt
that I was capable of everything
Fight!
Fight!
One blow to the heart
from the back
Did the children do it?
Eren, I told you to wait
at the foot of the mountain
Do you even realize what you've done?
I killed the mad dogs
The dogs that
were just like people
Eren!
The guards wouldn't have caught them
They would have run away from here
together with her
Anyway, you're so lucky
It's a deathly indifference
That's why
I'm angry
at you
But I
hurried to save her
Mikasa
Do you remember me?
I was with you
when you were little
Dr. JÃ¤ger
Tell me
Where should I go
from here?
I'm cold
I have nowhere to warm up
I don't have
anywhere else to go
I don't have a home
Here, take this
It's warm
It's warm
Mikasa
Let's live
with us
You've gone through
a hard blow
You need to
calm down
What's wrong with you?
Come on, let's go
Let's go home
Let's go home
Let's go
The world is cruel
Only the strongest survive
Back off, Ackerman
Get up on the wall
I'll help Vanguard
back off
Wait, Ackerman
But I want
to have my home
in this world
Eren
As long as you're here
I can do anything
To be continued
To be continued
To be continued
To be continued
To be continued
I have
nowhere to go
Mikasa was rushing to Eren
after completing his mission
But Eren's death
was the only thing
she could tell him
