I don't know what I'm doing, but I'm going to do it.
The return of humanity. The flash of light in the darkness of despair.
Hey, sabre!
Listen...
Who are you?
Who are you?
I'm a man.
I'm a man.
I'm a man.
I'm a man.
I'm a man.
I'm a man.
I'm a man.
I'm a man.
I'm listening!
Who are you?
I'm a shiganshina, Armin Arlert.
What a strange name! Did your parents give it to you?
His grandfather gave it to me.
Arlert? Why did you come here?
Humanity must defeat the giants!
That's a wonderful dream!
You will become a hindrance for the giants!
Wind up and turn!
Who are you?
I'm a shiganshina, Thomas Wagner.
I can't hear you!
I'm a shiganshina!
What?
Oh, come on!
He's been making fun of you for several years too.
Nostalgia!
No!
You're born of bread, you're a pig!
Yes! I'm born of bread!
But what's the point of that?
It's a tradition.
They kill everything human to bring them back to life.
That's why he humiliates them.
My body belongs to humanity!
The fourth row!
He doesn't touch any of them.
Some don't need a rite of worship.
Probably those who came to hell two years ago.
They have different eyes.
Let's go.
Who are you?
I'm a shiganshina, John Kirstein!
Why did you come here?
To become a guard and live inside the walls.
Is that so?
You want to live behind the walls?
Yes!
Am I allowed to sit here?
Such a scoundrel as you never become a guard!
Who are you?
What are you doing here?
I'm a native of the city of Jinai, Mark Bott.
I want to join the guard and dedicate my life to the king!
Is that so?
That's a noble goal.
You want to join it?
However...
The king doesn't need your miserable life.
Who are you?
What's your name?
I'm Kony Springer, a farmer from the southern village of Nagaku.
What's that, Kony Springer?
I told you yesterday.
This gesture means that you are ready to give your heart to society.
Do you remember?
Is your heart on the right side?
Hey, girl.
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
I'm talking to you.
Who are you?
I'm a farmer from the inner village of Daoba, Sasha Braus.
Sasha Braus.
What's that in your right hand?
Baked potatoes.
There were too many of them in the kitchen, so I took one.
Did you steal it?
Then why?
Why are you eating it now?
Potatoes become tasteless when they cool down.
That's why I decided to eat it now.
No, I'm asking about something else.
Why are you eating potatoes?
So you want to know why people eat potatoes?
Take half of it.
Half?
Look, that potato eater is still running.
Amazing.
It's been four hours.
But the fact that she will run today until she dies
is even worse than the fact that she will be left without dinner.
Daoba, it seems that this hunting village is deep in the mountains.
What is it?
Excavated agricultural work.
How could they excavate on the first day?
You can't do anything.
There is no place for the weak here.
Maybe they like working with the earth more.
By the way, I didn't hear where you were from.
We are from Shiganshina with him.
Is that so?
I see.
And you were there that day?
Oh, don't.
Have you seen the great giant?
Yes.
That's true.
We saw him.
That's true.
We saw him.
Really?
How big was he?
On the top of the wall.
What?
I heard he stepped over the wall.
No.
No, he wasn't that tall.
What was his face like?
There was almost no skin on his face.
But his mouth was very big.
Did you see the giant who broke Maria's wall?
I saw him.
He looked like a regular giant to me.
What do regular giants look like?
Guys, stop asking questions.
He doesn't want to remember the past.
Sorry, I just won't answer.
There's nothing special about giants.
When we learn to use maneuvering skills,
we will easily defeat them.
Finally, I became a soldier.
At first, I just hated them.
But now I will join the reconnaissance squad
and work with the face of the Earth,
all together.
Hey, are you out of your mind?
You just said that you were a soldier.
Did you just say that you would join the reconnaissance squad?
Yes, I did.
And you want to become a guard
and live a carefree life?
I'm just sincere.
It's much better than being brave in words,
but shaking in your soul from fear of giants.
Are you talking about me?
Stop it.
Well, I just wanted to warm up.
Oh.
You know, I was wrong.
I didn't doubt your courage.
Don't hold me against evil.
Yeah, I was wrong too.
Wait!
Sorry.
I haven't seen you here before.
You just have very beautiful hair.
Right?
Thank you.
Thank you.
Leave me alone.
You don't control yourself when you're angry.
Lessons again?
I was thinking,
you have too long hair.
They can get in your way during training.
Okay, I'll shorten them.
What?
What are you doing?
You're pulling my back.
What is it?
People's faith.
This is it.
It's just bread. I took it for you.
I'm sorry that it's not much, but I thought it would be better for you to drink water first.
My goddess! Thank you very much, goddess!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
My goddess! Thank you very much, goddess!
Hey!
What are you doing here?
She was running all day and probably got very tired.
I see. You like to do good things.
So you brought her bread.
Tell me, was the reward worth your efforts?
You don't have to answer.
I'll take her to the room for now.
You're doing a good thing too.
It's like a bribe. She will owe me.
Such a fool is easy to use.
The one who can't handle this task can't even be a bait for giants and will be expelled from the school.
These are the basics.
The exercise shows the ability to maneuver.
Look.
Perfect balance.
She already understands what to do.
Perfect balance.
She already understands what to do.
Born talent.
We have a lot of capable newcomers.
What's wrong with that?
It's like a talent on the contrary.
No matter how hard he tries, this obstacle will not overcome him.
Aaron Yager, what are you doing?
Turn your body!
What is it?
Why can't I hang?
It's a dream.
Do as it is written in the textbook.
Don't try to do it beautifully.
Slowly transfer the weight of your body to the ropes.
Do it calmly.
And you will succeed.
Even I was able to do it.
I think this time I will succeed.
Raise me.
Yes.
Yes.
He said yesterday that he would destroy all the giants until the last one.
Now he will come back to plow potatoes.
The crowd will not feed without food.
Aaron!
Don't kill yourself like that.
Tomorrow you will try again.
This is a failure.
I can't destroy the giants like this.
You have to change your goal.
What?
Don't try to become a soldier.
To fight is not only to risk your life.
You know.
I was there that day and saw what happened.
Do you think I'm so simple?
Aaron, your decision has nothing to do with it.
Why is that?
Because you don't decide whether you will become a soldier or not.
Well, if that's the case, you won't have to go back to farming all by yourself.
Don't worry.
You will not go alone.
I will go with you.
I can take this bread.
The End
Give me a couple of tips.
Sorry, I'm a genius.
I can do everything myself.
Hey, I'm happy to teach you.
I will explain how not to die from shame when you hang on a shell upside down.
Guys, please, why are you doing this?
Didn't you say yesterday that if a man can't do it, he has to leave?
You can't do anything.
It's not a place without shame.
Do you remember?
Please, I heard you're doing very well.
Bertolt, Reiner.
I'm sorry, but I don't think there's anything special about it.
That's why I can't give you any advice.
I see.
All that's left is to pray.
Tell me, you're refugees from Shiganjin, aren't you?
Well, yes.
You must know how terrible the giants are.
But you still went to the army.
Unlike Eren, I didn't see with my own eyes how the giants eat people.
But when I remember that the government sent refugees to the wall of Mary,
I can't sit and do nothing.
I see.
Where are you from?
We are from the village that was located near the western part of the wall of Mary.
There?
Yes.
The village was far from the river, and the news of the invasion came late.
It was late.
More precisely, it didn't come at all.
The giants came.
It happened at dawn.
The beast suddenly screamed, and people heard the sound of earthquakes.
But after a while we realized that it was the sound of steps.
When I realized that, I quickly opened the window.
I don't remember what happened after that.
Panic began.
Everyone ran with their heads broken.
Bertolt, why are you remembering this?
Sorry.
Eren, that's what I mean.
You are different from other students of this school.
What?
They don't know how terrible the giants are.
Bertolt!
Most of them joined the army to get their place in society.
They were convinced that it was good and honorable to be a soldier.
Not that they were peasants or workers.
To be honest, I'm no different from them.
I also want to become a guard and serve in security behind the wall.
And if it doesn't work out, I'll drop out of school.
Because fear lives in me.
There's nothing wrong with taking care of your own future.
And I want to come back to live in my own village.
That's all I want.
I will definitely come back from there.
And you, Eren?
Why did you become a soldier?
Me?
I decided to destroy them.
I have to wipe them off the face of the earth with my own hands.
That's why I'm here.
Are you saying that you weren't scared when you saw the giants?
No.
But now I'm not sure I'll be able to become a soldier.
I'll try to adjust the belt again.
And go to sleep.
You'll do it.
Eren Yeager.
You'll do it.
Eren Yeager.
You'll do it.
Eren Yeager.
You'll do it.
You'll do it.
Right?
Yes. Thank you, Reiner Braun.
Eren Yeager.
Are you ready?
Yes. I'll do it.
I'll do it.
Maybe I don't have the talent.
But I'll do my best until I succeed.
Begin.
I can't stop.
Because I have nothing left.
My weapon is perseverance.
Well done!
It worked!
It worked!
I'm hanging!
No!
Wait!
I can do it!
Put it down.
Me? What?
Wagner.
Take the belt with Yeager.
Yes.
The belt was wrong.
The equipment of your belt was worn out too much.
I have never seen such a breakdown.
You will need to order a new belt.
So he managed to hang even with a broken belt.
Wow!
So they don't exclude me?
No.
Good luck in your studies!
Hooray! It worked!
I have a belt!
I got it!
I will fight the giants!
You won't have to take care of me anymore!
Everything ended well.
This look says, well, have you eaten?
No.
He is glad that we will continue to study together.
Grisha, know that today your son became a soldier.
The following is the continuation.
The End
