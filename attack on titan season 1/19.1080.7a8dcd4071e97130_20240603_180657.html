Captain, what should we do?
Let's put her down! She's too dangerous! We have to kill her!
She's going to catch up with us!
We'll kill her here!
We're in the woods for that!
Isn't that right, Captain?
Just order us!
I order you to shut your ears!

ATTACK OF THE TITANS
Episode 1
Episode 57
Episode 58
He's dead?
What's your mission here?
Do we want to go right, do we want to go left, do we want to shoot everyone in a row?
The answer is wrong.
The mission of the detachment is to make sure that no hair falls off our guy's head.
Even if we all die.
Aren't they watching me?
We're going to go further, understand?
Yes, sir.
Further? How far?
She's breathing in our heads.
Again!
There's still a long way to go! We need to help!
Or they'll die too!
Eren, look at the road!
Gunter!
I'll clear the way! Go all the way!
But why?
Why?
If our detachment doesn't get past her, who will?
Another one is dead!
Maybe we could save him?
Another one is still fighting! Let's help him!
Eren, look at the road! Don't turn around!
You want me to turn away from my comrades?
You want me to kill them?
Exactly! You have an order! Do it!
I don't understand! Why don't we help them?
Why doesn't the captain explain anything?
Because he decided that it's better not to explain yet.
And you're still a coward, so you don't understand.
Stop fighting!
No!
I can fight on my own!
Why should I rely on others?
I can't handle it myself!
Eren, what are you doing?
You can't!
If the death is not threatening you, you promised!
Eren!
Maybe you're right!
Do you want to go forward?
I can see it.
He's as wild as a wild beast.
Even if he didn't have the power of the titan,
no matter how hard you press on him, no matter what cage you put him in,
he will never die.
He will never obey anyone.
I want to kill all the titans!
Eren, our decisions are different from yours because of experience.
But you don't have to trust our experience.
Choose.
Either believe in yourself,
or trust me and the other scouts.
I don't know what's best for me.
You can't know that.
You can trust your strength,
or the choice of those you trust.
But no one knows what will be right.
The main thing is that later you don't regret your choice so much.
Eren!
Eren!
Believe in yourself!
I've come up with a way that will almost never kill you.
What?
I've already said that I'll stop you in the face of the titan,
only if I kill you.
I've already said that I'll stop you in the face of the titan,
only if I kill you.
But there is a way that will only cripple you.
Although, of course, you need to act skillfully.
The point is to cut you out of the titan's neck.
Your arms and legs may not survive, but it's not a problem.
Everything will grow back like a lizard.
Even creepy.
Wait.
I don't know if everything will grow back and always.
Can't you come up with something else?
Do you want us to blow you off?
No.
Then be brave.
Don't you think we're scared?
You can kill us at the same time, so don't be afraid.
Yes.
Got it.
Can we leave the experience?
It's very dangerous.
However, why not try to find out something?
Under my leadership, yes.
Eren, always strive to know what you don't understand yet.
Even if it's deadly dangerous.
Even if it's dangerous.
Are you ready, Eren?
I'll give you a smoke signal when you can start.
From now on, everything depends on you.
Got it.
From this dried up well, no fool or titan will get out.
Probably.
Signal.
I didn't try to turn myself in since I touched the wall.
If I lose my mind, Levi's squad can kill me.
He didn't notice the signal?
No.
It's just that his abilities aren't that reliable.
Hey, Eren!
That's enough for today.
Something happened?
Something happened?
Hange...
I can't turn myself in.
Your bitten hands don't heal either?
No.
If you can't turn yourself in, there's nothing you can do but turn yourself into a wall of the sea.
Solve the problem.
It's an order.
Got it.
Don't give up, Eren.
It's easy to say.
So, you have more human than we thought.
It's better this way than to die of failure in battle.
It's not in vain that we have gained experience.
Yes.
It's better to be careful.
Why?
Why are they so calm?
They don't care that I can't turn myself in.
What's wrong with you?
Nothing.
Hey!
What's going on?
What?
It's torn!
Why now?
Calm down.
Captain Levi, I...
I told you to calm down.
All of you.
They are firing with small, single-loaded pistols.
It's a warning.
The red is marked.
The green is marked.
The black is marked.
The green is marked.
What's that?
What's that?
It's a scream.
Eren, what does it mean?
What?
Why now and without a command? Answer me!
Eren, wait!
Answer me, Eren, what are you up to?
Wait, questions later!
Prove that you are not an enemy to people, to all of humanity!
I don't care how!
Quickly!
You have to!
Just move this hand, I'll take your head off!
Come on, try!
I'm not kidding!
Hello!
I told you to calm down!
Captain, step back from Eren! You're too close!
No, you step back!
Now!
Why?
You have to!
What's wrong, Eren? Answer me!
I don't know!
Don't move!
Prove it to us!
I'm telling you!
Answer me!
Do you want to die?
We're not kidding!
Come on!
Do you hear or not?
Hit him!
Are you our enemy or ...?
Stop yelling at me!
Eren!
Eren!
Can I touch your hand?
Yes, you can!
Let me touch it!
Hangi!
Wait a minute!
It's hot!
Without a skin, it's terribly hot!
It's awful hot!
It's hot!
It's so hot!

Commander, don't lose your head!
Hey, isn't it hot with her, Eren?
What do you feel where the hand starts?
Let me see!

Catch up with me!
Run the chop and it will fall in!
Why the heck you cannot go back?
What is Plusy?
Then what's next?
Now!
Now!
He's gone.
What's next?
Now!
Now!
It's a famous athleticsEstest!
It's a famous athleticsEstest!
To be honest, I don't really like them.
Until I saw them with swords near me, I didn't suspect them.
How much do they doubt me?
Of course. That's why I chose them.
They say that you become a real scout only when you return from a mission alive.
The problem is that when you deal with titans, there is always not enough information.
There are too many options that cannot be predicted.
They had to teach themselves to predict at once and act quickly, without hesitation.
But that doesn't mean that they are soulless. I'm sure it wasn't easy for them to threaten you.
Captain.
Commander Hangi is here.
Where have you been? Were you tortured by a migraine?
Not at all. It's all right.
I thought I should report to the boss.
Anyway, look here.
Do you have a teaspoon?
Yes.
The right hand of the titan that you created was holding it like this between the index and the thumb.
It's hardly a pure coincidence.
Besides, neither the heat nor the pressure, for some reason, did not hurt her at all.
Do you have any thoughts?
Then I bent over to pick her up, and the transformation happened right away.
I see.
Maybe that's why you couldn't turn around earlier.
Kill the titans, fire a shell, lift a balloon.
Every time you turned around, you had a clear goal.
As I suppose, it's not enough to hurt yourself.
You still need to have a specific goal.
I suppose this time it really looked like the one when I fired the shell.
But turning into a titan to pick up a spoon?
Maybe we should go.
So you turned into a titan without a command?
Yes.
Wait, what are you doing?
It hurts.
It's not that simple.
Eren, how do you manage to bite through the blood?
It's a punishment for our negligence.
It's not enough.
We got angry.
What?
We got angry.
We got angry.
It's not enough.
We got angry.
We have to keep you in check.
There's nothing like that here, so don't imagine anything.
I'm sorry, Eren.
We all broke off the chain.
You must be terribly disappointed.
But we will rely on you.
And we want you to rely on us.
So...
Please...
trust us.
Eren, do something!
I'm with you!
Let me go!
I'm sorry!
The target is speeding up!
Forward!
We'll get away from it.
Get away?
It's impossible.
Soon it will crush us all.
And...
And yet...
Even on the verge of death, everyone decided not to stop
and not to save their comrades.
The captain never turned away.
And the rest believe in him.
They trust him completely.
Me too.
Then...
I will believe in them too.
Just as they believe in me.
Fire!
Fire!
We'll drive a little more, then we'll tie up the horses
and move on to the drives.
You will be on your own for now.
Elton, you stay behind the main one.
When you move away from the Titan, hide Eren.
You'll take my horse.
Really?
Does he want to take her alive?
Well, Eren, did you see?
We caught her.
So what?
So what, scouts?
No need to doubt us, fools.
Got it now?
Yes!
It seems to be motionless.
We need to be alert.
And yet, well done for luring her here.
Many of the rearguard died while we were trying to slow her down.
We wouldn't have made it without them.
Really?
Yes.
Well, thanks to them, we'll see who hides in this body.
I hope she didn't do it out of fear.
Next.
Next.
Next.
The End
Elvin Smith's secret operation.
It was the capture of the eye-shaped titan.
The scouts of the Survey Corps tried to expose his identity.
