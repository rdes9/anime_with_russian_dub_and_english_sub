We are screaming
No one can hear
Call me out

Hit him, get hit
Kill him, kill him
Kill him, kill him
And you're my daughter.
What are you waiting for? Go on!
What? You didn't know?
The higher-ups of the reconnaissance team and that guy are going to the capital. Today they will pass through our city.
I see.
But this time he will definitely be paraded.
I don't know, but the main thing is that after they go, the gate is sealed.
What? Did you say that the gate must be sealed?
Do you want to be even stronger than the prophet of God's creation?
Maria! Rose! Sheena!
If you slander three goddesses, God will never forgive us for this!
This is one of the terrorists. Don't get involved with him.
Where are you going? There are fans everywhere.
Let's go.
Calm down! Only the sacred walls will save us from death!
The city of Stahes, department of the National Guard
You finally woke up. You had such a scary face that I decided not to wake you up.
Sorry, Annie.
You haven't been well lately.
What kind of face? Are you mad at me?
She's so cold.
Leave her alone.
She came to us from Trost.
And she was the only one of us who went to battle.
I see. What kind of girls do you like?
What did you find in her?
Hitchie, a fool like you could only get into the guard in one way.
What do you mean? I don't understand. Tell me.
Shut up!
Hitchie!
Don't worry.
Today you have a little unusual task. That's why I gathered you here.
The command of the intelligence unit will soon arrive in the capital.
Today they will pass through the central streets of our city.
Escorting is the task of the Royal Guard, so we will accompany them around the city.
You are temporarily allowed to use the drives.
You will guard the process with the people from Trost.
You will get to the starting point of the operation by boat.
That's all.
Can I ask you something?
What?
What are we going to guard the command of the intelligence unit from?
No one has ever been against the royal power inside these walls.
Small criminals also fall behind the organization if they don't have a base outside the city walls.
And what is the motive?
You are serious about your work. You will be the commander.
All details are indicated here.
We officers are too busy. You will deal with the task yourself.
Just look, don't be afraid.
Well, friends, let's continue.
Quiet!
Damn!
This is bullying!
Yes, this organization has rotted even more than I thought.
However, thanks to this, I entered it.
The officers are lazy here and are used to dropping all their work on newcomers.
An unpleasant surprise.
Rejections!
They can only think about themselves. Real rejections!
Maro, why are you complaining?
You are now also a guard.
You are the same.
I am not the same.
I am different from all of you.
I am here to correct the National Guard.
Wow, Marlon!
I didn't expect you to be like this.
And how are you going to fix it?
You have to climb to the top.
I will lead the guard and correct the law.
I will correct the law.
And I will punish all the guards who did injustice.
I will get rid of them.
I will make people out of them again.
That's all.
I will return them to their human form.
You are a fan.
I thought you were just a boring guy.
You have a very noble goal.
Good luck to you.
I wonder.
I think the most dangerous thing is when the army is headed by such good people.
Wow! I didn't know you could speak.
I think you are a fair person.
You speak the right things.
I have already met such people.
They don't want to go down the drain.
I respect them for having the courage to fight.
However, I think they are fools.
Maybe the person you are talking about was a fool.
But I am different.
We have been talking for too long.
Let's go!
In 45 minutes the object will cross the outer gate.
As soon as we arrive at the place, take your positions.
Got it?
Got it.
What are you doing?
What is this?
Military equipment?
They are transporting it.
This is suspicious.
It seems that a trading company is involved here.
What are they doing?
They are taking military equipment to the side.
Wow! What a task!
Wow!
He is really a fan.
We still have some time.
Let's watch the performance.
Well, let's go!
You are new!
What do you want?
The sale of military equipment!
It's a crime!
So what?
All military equipment is bought for the money of our people!
And his sale!
You have just become a guard, and you are already teaching the life of officers.
I am interested in watching your future.
Buy yourself a woman and relax.
Wait!
The sale of military equipment!
What is this?
Anya?
You can't do everything you want!
We can!
We can do anything!
Calm down, please.
I'm sorry. He's a fool and always looking for trouble.
We'll explain to him himself that he was wrong.
Besides...
People are watching.
We're attracting attention.
You're lucky today.
Well, are you in character?
Of course.
We must celebrate.
Will you shoot them?
You wanted to give credit to those who do injustice.
Marlon, I'm ready to help you.
Marlon, I'm ready to help you.
Marlon, I'm ready to help you.
Marlon, I'm ready to help you.
Marlon, I'm ready to help you.
I'm ready to help you.
Damn it!
It must be hard for you to serve a beauty.
No, it's nothing like that.
Oh, your friend.
The one you were talking about.
He would have shot him.
Maybe.
Tell me, what do you think of me?
I'm just a garbage,
who just floats down the river?
I don't know.
I don't know.
But all normal people just float down the river.
Most of all,
I want to be considered an ordinary person.
Let me even float down the river.
No!
Annie!
Hi.
You're a real guard now.
Armin.
The Royal Guard consists of 2,000 people,
but together with the garrison troops there are about 5,000.
About 200 guards are assigned to each city on the wall.
They train young soldiers and command defense.
Why are you in such clothes?
I pretend to be a merchant.
I can't see under the raincoat, but I have a neural drive.
See?
Why, Armin?
Annie, I want you to help us free Eren.
And what's next?
People who resist the Royal Guard have nowhere to go.
We'll just hide him.
We're not going to fight the whole army.
It will look like a betrayal of one squad.
But for us the main thing is to win time
to gather evidence of Eren's innocence.
That's what we want.
Evidence?
What exactly are you going to find?
Tell me.
I'm sorry, I can't.
I'm sorry, but I can't help you.
I won't tell anyone about our meeting.
Annie, please!
Eren will be killed if we don't help.
The officials don't understand anything.
They only care about themselves.
They don't care about people.
They push humanity to extinction.
Let my words sound unconvincing.
But we have no choice.
We have to risk everything we have.
Of course, I'll try not to make you suspect anything.
But we need to go through the patrols unnoticed.
We need the help of the guards.
We have no other choice.
Armin, do you think I'm such a good person?
A good person?
I don't know.
I don't really like this expression.
It seems to me that people call only those
who use convenient people for their own purposes.
But every person lives for himself, not for others.
So if you don't agree to help me,
you'll become a bad person for me.
Okay.
I agree.
Surprisingly, we easily escaped.
However, this is not surprising.
We were guarded by brave guards.
Don't talk.
Thanks to the master of disguise, Jeanne.
However, he will soon be bitten.
After all, we are not like him at all.
Don't worry.
You both have a scary look and are criminals.
Do we look like him?
Tell me, how were you going to cross the wall if I didn't help you?
We were going to break through with maneuvering weapons.
This is stupid.
We had to run before the arrival of Dastahes
so as not to cross the wall of Guad.
Why did you decide to run here?
Because we thought that on the crowded streets of this city
it would be easy to replace Aaron.
And I also decided that pretending to be obedient
and giving the guard a warning
is better than breaking through with force.
It's time.
Yes.
I understand now.
This way.
This way?
Yes.
We'll go through here.
This is the entrance to the ruins of an ancient underground city.
This underground passage leads to the outer gates.
I didn't know there was such a passage here.
Annie!
Why are you up?
Just don't tell me you're afraid of the dark.
Yes.
I'm afraid of the dark.
You are too brave.
A snack for giants.
You don't understand the feelings of a weak, fragile girl.
A girl who can throw a man into the air is not so fragile.
Don't be stupid, let's go.
No, I won't go.
It's scary there.
If you don't go up, I'll go.
What nonsense are you talking about?
I don't understand.
Get down here, Annie.
Don't shout, let Mikasa shout.
For some reason, there are no people around us.
Not a single person.
I didn't think it would hurt so much.
How long have you been looking at me like that, Armin?
Annie, tell me why you had Marco's drive on the inspection?
We collected his drive together.
I remember every scratch on it.
I recognize it by touch.
I see.
I specifically replaced the drives.
So you killed those two giants who were in our captivity.
Maybe.
But if you suspected me a month ago, why didn't you do anything then?
I still can't believe it.
I want to think it was a mistake.
That's it.
Annie, you didn't kill me when you had such an opportunity.
Thanks to you, we ended up here.
Yes, I'm sorry about that.
I couldn't imagine that you'd track me down.
I wonder why I didn't kill you that time.
Annie, I still believe that this is some kind of misunderstanding,
that this is some kind of bad joke.
Come down to us! Prove your innocence!
You can prove your good intentions by coming down here!
Come down now!
I won't come down.
I couldn't be a soldier without me.
Stop your jokes! Come down to us!
Let's talk, Annie! We can do it!
Enough!
I can't listen to this anymore.
It's useless.
I'll cut you into pieces again, Titan.
Armin, I'm glad you thought I was a good person.
You managed to trick me.
But it doesn't matter.
Because my battle will begin now!
Eren!
Mikasa!
It's too late!
Mikasa!
It's too late!
THE END
THE END
THE END
