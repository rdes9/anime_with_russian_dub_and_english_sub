...
On that day, humanity remembered
I remembered the fear that controlled them, which drove him to the cage, and let him go.
Everyone, get ready for battle. The target is one person. We have to stop him. Here will be the first reinforcement.
I see the target.
We are moving to the fifth group. We need to distract them. Everyone, go into maneuvering mode.
Attack from all sides.
We will show you the power of humanity.
Attack of the Titans.
Attack of the Titans.
Attack of the Titans.

Attack of the Titans.
Read this letter in 2000 years.
The fall of Shiganshina.
Is that you, Mikasa?
It's time to go back.
How did we get here?
I see you haven't woken up yet.
Yes.
I think I just saw a very long dream.
What was it about?
I don't remember.
Eren, why are you crying?
Listen! The wall is built by the Lord himself!
It is proof of his existence!
Not a single man on earth dares to defile it!
Don't tell anyone that I was crying.
I won't.
But you started crying for no reason.
Let Grisha see you.
What nonsense!
I won't tell my father.
Why are you crying, Eren?
Is that you, Hannes?
Are you mad at Mikasa?
What? I'm not crying.
Damn it!
Damn it!
You should have done that!
They are drinking again.
Join us.
What about your work?
Today we guard the gate.
When you are at work all day, your throat quickly dries up.
And sometimes, among the drinks in which we quench our thirst,
there is alcohol.
What if you have to fight?
Fight with whom?
With the giants!
When they break the wall and break into our city!
Tell me, Eren.
Why don't you remember?
The war has grown, Doctor.
If they suddenly destroy the wall, we will fight.
But you know, this has not happened in the last hundred years.
It's true.
But my father always said that troubles happen when you don't expect them.
Doctor, everyone respects him.
Once upon a time he saved our city from the epidemic.
We are all very grateful to him.
But giants are a completely different matter.
When I became a soldier, I saw several giants
who wandered not far from the wall.
But they cannot overcome this 50-meter wall.
So you are not even going to fight them?
We are not going to.
Why?
Then stop calling yourself military!
You are just workers on the wall!
There is nothing wrong with that.
Eren, when soldiers fight for weapons,
this is the worst time.
Maybe someone will say that we, the Dramas, do nothing.
But we all live in peace.
We never go outside the wall.
But we can eat and sleep.
But in this case, it turns out that
we are not Dramas.
Only children can't change anything.
Does he really want to join the intelligence squad?
Eren, forget about the intelligence squad.
What? Are you going to laugh at the scouts too?
It's not that I'm laughing.
The intelligence squad is back!
The outer gates are opening!
Let's go! Let's meet the heroes!
Let's go!
I can't see anything.
I can't see anything.
Is that everyone who came back?
Everyone else was eaten.
That's because they went outside the wall.
Moses! Moses!
I'm sorry, I can't find my son.
Where is he? Tell me!
You're Moses's mother.
Bring her here.
Unfortunately, we could only take his hand.
Tell me, my son, did he fulfill his duty?
Let him die as a hero.
But his death will help humanity in the fight against the Titans, right?
Tell me.
Of course.
That is, this time, unfortunately, this campaign
This time, too.
This time, too, it was absolutely useless.
I ruined them all.
I was too self-confident.
We still don't know.
We didn't even take a step closer to understanding who they are.
Call!
It's a terrible sight.
It's just scary.
Thanks to such a leap, the giants will only get thicker and stronger.
What are you doing?
What are you doing, Mikasa?
Come back here!
Mikasa, let me go!
What are you doing? My wood is scattered.
Eren, tell me, did you change your mind to join the reconnaissance squad?
Help me collect the wood.
There's nothing to collect here.
Humanity is protected by three walls.
The outer wall is the wall of Mary, then there is the wall of the Rose and then the wall of the Shina.
The distance between the walls is approximately the same, a little more than 100 kilometers.
From the wall of the Shina to the center of the people's settlement is 250 kilometers.
We're back!
Well done!
Eren, today you are surprisingly hardworking.
Yes.
What are you doing?
You have red ears.
So you're lying.
Mikasa helped you, didn't she?
What?
Father, are you leaving?
For work?
Yes.
To the inner lands.
For two or three days.
Eren said he wanted to join the reconnaissance squad.
Why did you tell him?
Eren!
What were you thinking about?
Do you even know how many people died outside the wall?
I know!
In that case ...
Eren, Eren!
Why do you want to go behind the wall?
I want to know what the real world looks like.
I don't want to live my whole life behind the wall.
In ignorance!
Besides, if no one continues the talk of scouts,
then all their deaths will be in vain!
I see.
It's time for me to go.
Or I'll be late for the ship.
Dear, convince him.
Karl, you can't forbid a person to explore and learn about the world.
Eren, when I see you,
I'll show you the secret that lies in the basement.
Really?
Have a good trip!
I forbid you to join this useless squad.
Useless?
In my opinion, people who live like cattle and are happy with this are much more useless.
Eren!
Eren!
Mikasa!
He's always getting into trouble.
But you always help each other.
Well, Eretik?
If it's offensive, try to give it back.
If I give it back, then I'll be like you!
What?
You know that my words are true.
But in return, you can only hit me.
Does that mean you've lost to me?
Shut up, damn demagogue!
Let him go!
Eren?
That's stupid, he's going to break now!
Let's have fun from the bottom of our hearts!
Let's break his fists!
Mikasa, run!
We're out of here!
Run!
They saw me!
They got scared and ran away!
Hurry, they got scared of Mikasa!
Are you okay, Armin?
I can get up on my own.
Okay.
I told them that sooner or later,
humanity will have to come out.
And they beat me for it.
It's not fair.
Why don't everyone like people who want to come out?
The thing is,
the last hundred years in the settlement are ruled by the world.
People are afraid that those who come out
can attract giants.
According to the king's policy,
even just having an interest in the outside world is taboo.
We can manage our own lives.
No, Eren.
You're wrong.
Mikasa, why did you tell your parents?
I didn't promise to keep quiet.
And what did they say?
Well, they were not happy.
Of course.
I don't understand people who think
that we will always be safe behind these walls.
Mom!
Even if it lasted a hundred years,
there is no guarantee that it will break today.
Anything can happen.
What was that?
Explosion?
Let's go!
Is that a meteorite?
Wait, Armin!
What happened?
What did you see there?
What did you see?
What did you see?
What did you see?
What did you see?
It can't be!
It's a wall!
50 meters high!
It's them!
Giants!
Giants!
In the wall there was a crack!
Giants are in the city!
Run, Eren!
Run, Eren!
Run, Eren!
Run, Eren!
Run, Eren!
Run, Eren!
Run, Eren!
Run!
Eren!
There's my house!
There's my mom!
Mikasa!
This city...
...can't be saved.
This is the end.
There's a crowd of giants here!
The fragments shouldn't get into the house.
When I turn around...
...I see him again.
Mom!
Mom!
Eren!
Mikasa, stay there!
We'll move the roof!
Hurry, Mikasa!
I'm trying!
The giants got into the city.
Eren!
Take Mikasa and run!
Right now!
I won't run!
We'll save you!
Eren, my legs are broken.
I can't run!
Run!
I won't run!
We'll save you!
Eren, my legs are broken.
I can't run!
I won't run!
Run!
I'll carry you!
Why do you never listen to me?
Why do you never listen to me?
Listen to me at least now!
Mikasa!
No!
I can't!
We'll all die!
Hannes!
Take my children away!
Take my children away from here.
You underestimate me, Karura.
I will kill the giant, and then I will save you all.
Wait! Do not fight him!
I could save your children, but today I will return my debt to society.
Karura
Wait! Let me go! What are you doing?
Thank you.
Mom can not leave with us!
Eren! Mikasa! You must live!
Mikasa!
Do not leave me!
Stop!
Mom!
On that day, humanity remembered.
It remembered the fear that controlled them,
which drove them into a cage and did not let them out.
The continuation follows.

TASTY DIALOGUE WITH ELENA BAZHENOVA
