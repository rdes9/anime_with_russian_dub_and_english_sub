The scouts went on a mission to try to get to the Shiganshins, but they ran into a wise woman of the Titan.
Losing one fighter for another, they turned into the forest of giant trees. But no one knew what for.
If our squad can't beat her, then who is it?
Another one is dead! Maybe we could save him?
Choose, or believe in yourself, or trust me and the rest of the scouts.
I'm with you!
Fire!
Is he really going to take her alive?
Well, Aaron, did you see that? We caught her!
That's what the scouts are capable of!
There's no doubt in us, Durin!
Fire!
It looks like she's motionless.
We need to be on the lookout.
And all the best for luring her here.
Many of the Arihards died while we were trying to slow her down.
That's the only thing we can do.
Well, thanks to them, we'll see who hides in this body.
I hope she didn't do anything there out of fear.
Fire!
Fire!
Attack on the Chitans!
Episode 57, Irwin Smith
Is that the Embigoon? Or does it look more like the Colossus?
Is that really Commander Irwin?
Hey, what are you doing there?
Aaron, there's no time to think! We need to hide!
Yes, sir!
Wait, Levi!
One by one!
Second and third calculations, fire!
Release everything that's left!
Look, he's climbing!
Yeah, if he gets here, I'll go to another tree.
But I think they'll call us back from here soon.
They're shooting somewhere in the forest.
Do you think that's why?
Possibly.
Mikasa, what's going on?
Mikasa, what's going on in the forest?
Is someone shooting from a gun?
Don't you remember that we were carrying guns?
Yeah, we've been talking for a while.
Listen, Bertolt, where could Christ have gone?
I'm sorry, I don't know.
I don't understand anything anymore.
Anyway, what am I doing here?
I'd rather go home.
Let's switch positions, Armin!
Yeah.
I see they've got it.
They're getting better and better.
That means they can learn, and that's scary.
But not all of them are equally good.
Armin, it looks like there was a funny fight going on in the forest.
I think I'm guessing something.
They've lured that titan there to catch her.
Or rather, to catch the one who's hiding in her.
That's what Irwin wanted.
He's been doing this since the very beginning, right?
I can understand why he didn't tell the newcomers,
but why did he have to hide it from you?
You're a proven fighter!
Shut up!
You mean Irwin and Levin don't trust you?
But it looks exactly like that!
Petra, pull out all his teeth and step back!
No, Eren's right.
I know the reason why they could hide the truth from us.
You can only justify distrust of your allies with one thing.
There's a titan or a spy hiding among us on the side of the titans.
You think so too?
Is that one of ours?
Yes, apparently.
A spy?
Are you serious?
In any case, the commander suspects it.
It seems that only those who served with him five years ago knew about his plan.
I see.
That's what I thought.
I see, Eren.
That's your answer.
Yes, that makes sense.
Five years ago, we stepped back from the first wall,
and a spy could sneak into us.
A spy?
The commander wanted to narrow the circle of suspects.
So that spy killed Sonya and Bina.
I remember.
The commander just didn't ask me.
What do you see?
Who do you think is our enemy?
So that's what he meant.
If we understood the question, we could have taken part in his plan.
But I don't think anyone would have guessed.
I did, but I was reasonably silent.
Do you know why?
Why?
What?
You didn't get it?
Well, of course.
What can I expect from you?
You're growing and growing.
No, you're portraying Captain Levi again.
He's never so smart.
If the plan works, we'll learn something new about our world.
But still, the price is too high.
Even for such a noble purpose.
Do you think the commander was wrong?
I think it's wrong.
If we knew that the Titans knew about our plans,
we would have acted differently.
And our commanders would have been able to prepare.
No, there's nothing to blame him for.
What do you mean, there's nothing to blame him for?
How many people died in vain?
Jean, it's easy to criticize someone's decision.
But no one knows how exactly everything will turn out.
And you still have to make a choice.
You can't avoid it.
Hundreds of your fighters or all the people behind the walls.
The commander made a choice and sacrificed his hundred.
Eren, you don't understand yet, but you will soon.
Irwin Smith was entrusted with commanding the scouts for a reason.
He's the hope of all mankind.
You see how much the captain trusts him.
You'll understand if they don't kill him before.
I may not be so experienced, but I know one thing for sure.
Only the one who is ready to sacrifice the most precious person is capable of changing something.
The one who is ready to refuse the monster in the battle.
The one who is ready to sacrifice the most precious person is capable of changing something.
The one who is ready to refuse the monster in the battle.
The one who is ready to refuse the monster in the battle.
The multi-barrel trap is a new development of the scouts' service for capturing the titans.
Each block of seven barrels is loaded with twisted ropes with arrow-like tips.
Fire!
Well, do you like it?
You don't even have to scratch yourself and move around.
Maybe even forever.
The more your wounds heal, the stronger the arrow-like tips get into them.
But what will they do to the one who is inside?
Where are Levi and Mickey?
What will they do to the one who is inside?
Can she strengthen her body in the right places for protection?
It sounds like what I heard about the armored titan.
Will we be able to weaken the defense with swords?
There is no time to find out.
If so...
Yes?
Prepare the explosives.
We'll tear her hands off.
Yes.
But if we lay down everything we have, we risk destroying the one who is hiding inside.
Then lay down as much as you can on your wrist.
We'll blow it up on my command.
It will be done.
Hey, maybe you'll come out in a good way.
We have no time to waste with you.
Well, what are you counting on?
Do you think you'll be able to escape?
Think better.
What have we gone through because of you?
You killed my people with a lot of imagination.
Did you have fun?
Well, it's my turn to have fun.
You don't mind, do you?
I think you'll understand me.
Oh, yes.
Oh, yes.
One more question.
Do you mind if we cut off your arms and legs?
They'll grow anyway.
I'm talking about your real human arms and legs.
After all, we need you to live.
THE END
What kind of concert was that?
It's her pre-death scream.
Erwin, it stinks.
Where from?
From everywhere, from all sides at once.
What's wrong with them?
They all broke into the forest.
And they seem to have forgotten about us.
What is it?
Are they all runaways?
What's the difference?
Stop them!
Fight!
What's going on here?
Wait!
I know it's a forest.
I'm from the hunting village.
It's howling.
The beast is cornered.
I remember I was told that the end of the hunt is more dangerous than anything.
So we need to be careful.
Be careful as never before.
The forest does not forgive mistakes.
I grew up in the mountains, too.
It's not like you to grow bread.
I see.
Sasha is usually a bit of a loser.
Especially when something bad is approaching.
Armin thought that Eren was somewhere in the middle of the line.
Prepare the explosives.
Erwin, the first wave is coming from the east.
It's almost here.
Escorts, intercept them.
They don't notice us.
Are they all runaways?
Three of them are breaking through.
Captain!
Did you arrange it?
Confess.
They ran after her.
Titans from all sides!
All to battle!
Stand up for death, but protect the captive Titan!
It doesn't come out.
Back off!
Back up!
Return to the Crown!
Three of them!
Return to the Crown!
We've been outsmarted.
How could you not recognize me?
So what?
The enemy was ready to sacrifice everything.
I didn't expect her to give herself to the Titan to destroy the evidence.
And that's why we were outsmarted in court?
If we come back empty-handed, I don't even know what's waiting for us with Eren.
We'll think about it later.
Now our task is to return and not make new losses.
That's the main thing.
The body pair is limiting the view.
The smoke signals may be seen poorly.
I'll call my detachment.
Wait, Levi.
Refill the gas and blades.
No time.
And we don't need it.
Why?
It's an order.
Okay, Eren.
I believe you know what you're doing.
Retreat!
Everyone back off!
Settle the horses!
What?
That's it?
We're coming back!
What's going on?
Where's Eren?
Looks like they're done.
Let's get ready to retreat.
Well, let's go.
Let's see who they got out of there.
Do we really know who it is?
It's all thanks to you.
I didn't do anything.
You didn't trust us.
It's all because you made the choice to trust us.
And it's not easy to make the right choice.
You can't fool him, Peter.
Think about it. You chose.
He whined and complained all the way.
Well, it's good that he didn't die on the first outing.
But I'll only count that when the outing is over.
The outing is over.
And it won't end until you're in your bed.
Got it?
God, I know.
Hello, Petra.
By the way, you were whining on the first mission.
And you wet your pants.
What are you doing now?
Why did you say that?
He's going to laugh at me now.
Is that true?
By the way, Eren, I didn't do anything like that.
Stop whining.
I killed more than you, Titan.
I killed more than you, got it?
Who else? It's not important for the fighter.
Shut up, you fool!
Petra, did you spray everything on the flight?
Quiet!
You're not sitting here in nature.
And the outing is behind the wall.
By the way, I didn't do anything like that either.
And here's the signal from Captain Levi.
We're moving towards the captain.
We'll talk when we get back.
Let's get back!
Erwin, why did you tell Levi to refuel?
Time is running out.
The Titan was eaten by a woman.
But I didn't see who was inside.
I didn't see if he was eaten or not.
And you?
Yes.
If your assumption is correct,
and if you return to human form,
she kept her mobility,
and hid a loaded rifle,
then now she's somewhere here in our uniform.
Captain Levi?
No, it's not him.
Who are you?
Gunter!
Hey, what's wrong with you?
Gunter!
The enemy has disguised itself as one of our people.
The sequel is coming.
It seems like the time has stopped.
Come on, wake up.
I escaped from the deep darkness.
I ran away like a fly.
We were like living corpses.
Let's meet again outside the walls.
In a place without maps.
The capture operation failed.
The Titan appeared in front of Eren again.
It was the special operation of the Titan-killer group.
