        <pre>In the year 850, people for the first time managed to beat the titans in part of their lands, although at a huge price.
So, I am happy to announce you as the soldiers of the intelligence service. Now this is your free greeting. Be ready to give your heart.
You managed to defeat fear of death. You are all brave fighters. Congratulations from the bottom of my heart.
A month later, the intelligence unit led by Irvin Smith came out of Coronets to find a way to Chiganchino, where, according to our information, there is a mystery about the titans.
We start the 57th walk behind the wall. Follow me!

Hard! Weak! Defend the formation!
It's okay. The support will figure it out. Let's go further!
Go forward! Go forward!
Go forward!
The support group will be with us only in the former city. Then everything was planned by the titans. We can rely only on the invented by the commander Irvin construction. The place of our elite group is here.
Hello, they will handle it. They will take over my friends with the titans.
What did you learn for a whole month? Remember, Salaga, the key to success is to avoid the titans, isn't it?
Oh, no!
The shot will end. I'm in position. See you, Irvin!
Look, don't lose your head if you meet the titans.
I'll try!
The avant-garde will be centered in a semicircle, but so that they can see each other. Keep a constant distance between you. All messages must be transmitted as far as possible.
We can do it! Calm down!
The titans will mostly be found in the front row.
The one who noticed the titan immediately shoots with a red signal rocket.
Anyone who sees the rocket shoots with a red signal rocket.
Seeing the signal, the commander of the green rocket indicates to everyone the new direction of the structure.
Anyone who noticed the titan, immediately shoots with a red signal rocket.
Anyone who sees the rocket, shoots in the same color, transmitting the signal further.
Having seen the signal, the commander of the green rocket points the entire formation in a new direction.
Look at each other!
Thus, the formation is moving towards the goal, avoiding the collision with the titans.
However, because of Leviathan or other obstacles, the titan may get stuck in the formation unnoticed.
Red! Red! Red rocket!
Braus, come here!
Did they really pierce through one of them?
Let's take it on ourselves!
Braus, come on!
I'll take care of them! Let's split up!
Got it!
Red! Red rocket!
Commander!
Take him to the position!
We have calmed him down!
It's strange...
The red signal has been around for a long time, and the formation is still broken.
Could it be...
Remember, this concerns only the usual titans, whose behavior is easy to predict.
A black signal?
Some kind of titan is heading deep into the formation?
It looks like it.
It's...
Bigur!
You can only fight the biguns, because they are unpredictable.
Watch out, we'll have to kill him.
Sis!
You're going to hit him in the neck!
I'll stop him!
Got it!
It's not very useful to have the engines open.
The position is too unfavorable.
Who's that?
Alert!
It's better not to engage in a fight with him.
We'll kill him here.
Come on, Sis!
Hooray!
We did it!
Well, that's it?
You came to me?
Well done!
Well, you're more important to me.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Again?
The right flank?
Is that the Voron counting?
Since he didn't pay attention to them, it's another bigun.
Well, what are you going to do?
Sis, let's repeat?
Got it!
Second in a row.
Today is clearly not our day.
Not less than 14 meters.
We'll have to be tough with him.
Wow!
He's flying faster than us!
Sis, don't let him catch up with R'n'R!
Got it!
Go!
No!
That's not a gun!
It's another one!
She has a mind, like an armored one, or a colossus, or Erron.
A man in the body of a titan? But who? And why?
What should I do? This is the end, and I will die! She will kill me!
Run! Run!
What does she need?
And in general, they?
What do they all need?
The structure, invented by the commander of the scouts Irwin Smith, has repeatedly increased the survival of the fighters behind the walls.
The formation acts like a radar, informing the commander of the appearance of the titans and allowing him to change course on the move.
Someone, tell me, the right flank is destroyed.
One of the titans, a woman, brought with her a whole crowd. Is there anyone alive?
She didn't kill me? I don't understand anything.
She took a hood off me, to see my face.
Armin! Reiner!
How are you? Can you stand up?
You can't live long here without a horse. Come on, sit down.
Yes.
Someone is trying to kill me.
I don't understand anything.
I don't understand anything.
I don't understand anything.
Someone signaled that he saw a fugitive. Isn't that the one with the moustache?
It's not a fugitive. It's a man in the body of a titan.
What do you mean?
Wait a minute. First we need to send a signal.
Quickly. Something bad has happened.
We need to warn them.
Wait.
It seems that Jean has already shot.
It's from the right flank.
It's bad. It seems that the mission is canceled.
It seems that part of the right flank is destroyed.
A bunch of titans came.
There are a lot of fast ones among them.
It's not clear where they came from.
We're holding them off for now, but we can't let them know.
A lot of losses.
They can get to us.
She came from the same side.
Are you sure?
She's guiding them.
She?
Where did the titan come from?
Is it a fugitive?
No. In fact, it's a man in the body of a titan.
Someone just like Eren.
What?
Why did you decide so, Armin?
The titans just want to eat us.
It's deadly for us.
But they don't think about killing someone.
But she grabbed Sisa when he aimed at her in the neck and hit Ozim.
She didn't kill him to eat.
Obviously, she has a different nature.
When the Colossus and the armored titan broke the walls,
it was she who brought all the others who filled the cities.
They are deliberately fighting against people.
Or maybe not.
I thought she was looking for someone.
If it's possible, maybe she's looking for Eren.
Eren?
He's on the left side.
They are on the right flank.
On the right?
They gave me a plan where they are marked on the left flank.
I have them drawn on the front and on the right.
But they couldn't fit them in the front row.
Where are they?
Probably there, where it's safest.
That is, in the middle, closer to the rear edge.
Armin, there is no time to think.
We will not show signals how great the threat is.
If she gets to the commanders, it's over for them.
Then the ship will collapse and that's it, we're here.
And what do you suggest?
I hope we can still distract her.
And give the rest of the time to retreat.
Maybe if we're lucky.
Of course.
But I'm telling you, she's reasonable.
We're no more than hot dogs for her.
She'll slap us in the face.
Really?
Yeah, you scared me.
Are you Jan?
You don't look like it.
You've always been thinking only about yourself.
Come on.
I don't want to disappoint the one I held in my hands.
Now I...
I know what I have to do.
We chose our own path.
Are you with me or not?
Put on your hoods, close your eyes.
So that the face is not visible.
I think she won't kill us if she doesn't see who we are.
Here it is.
Do you think she won't touch the one who can be Eren?
What are you?
It's better than nothing.
Let's hope she has a twin.
Armin.
You always turned me away from your unhealthy attachment to Eren.
But it turns out she gives something.
Well, thank you.
Although you have an original manner of praising people.
She runs much slower than before.
Maybe she's tired?
If she speeds up again, we won't have time.
We have to act.
Now, urgently!
The main thing is to remember what I said.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
The main thing is to remember what I said.
We'll distract her as much as we can.
To give the rest of the time to retreat.
We need to keep her longer.
It will be great if we manage to cut her heels.
Just don't do anything stupid.
Don't try to kill her.
She knows that her neck is a vulnerable place.
She doesn't look like the rest of the Titans.
She can't be killed.
At the very least, it's not possible for any of the people.
Only two of them?
Maybe.
At the very least, it's not possible for any of the people.
She doesn't look like the rest of the Titans.
At the very least, it's not possible for any of the people.
This bitch!
Her movements are much more accurate than the others!
Damn it!
Looks like I underestimated her!
She closed her neck!
Jean!
Damn it! I have nowhere to go!
I'm lost!
Now she will grab the rope and I will be dead!
Jean!
Revenge for the one who stole the Titan for lunch!
Armin?
She suddenly froze!
It's her!
She killed him!
He was on the right flank!
He was about to die!
Revenge for him!
What's wrong with him?
He was hit by a blow to the brain!
But that wasn't enough!
Reiner?
He was my best friend!
She crushed him in front of my eyes!
He's aiming at the neck?
But it might work!
Now that Armin has distracted her...
Armin!
Hey!
Reiner!
Wait!
He did it!
I was so surprised by Mikasa's abilities that I forgot what he was capable of!
Well, we've won enough time!
Let's run away from her!
If she doesn't eat anyone, she'll leave us alone!
Look!
Our lady has set her tail on fire and is running away!
Oh no!
Why?
The middle of the back row is on that side!
Is she running to Eren?
