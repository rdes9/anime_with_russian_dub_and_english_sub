        <pre>In 845, when the titan Colossus and the armored titan emerged from nowhere and broke through the wall, our life was completely changed.
The giants, who had no food for more than a hundred years, drove humanity into an even closer cage.
No!
Humanity left the wall of Mary, losing 20% of the population and a third of the territory. The living area was now limited by the wall of roses.

Third year of training
Come on, move your feet, giants!
Army Narnat, what are you standing for?
Is it too hard? Are you too tender?
In a real battle, you would have been eaten ten times already!
Damn it!
Give it here!
This mission is going well! You can fly out of the school!
Help me! You can also be reduced to a common ball!
Talk less and run faster! I haven't changed my mind yet!
Reiner Braun! He has a strong body and a strong spirit!
The students trust him!
I'm dead, but I brought my backpack myself!
Army Narnat! He has a weak body, but surprisingly, he has a strong spirit!
Lionheart! He is determined and cruel, but he is bad at working in the team!
Bertolt Fuber! He has great potential, but not enough initiative!
Jan Kirstein! He is great at maneuvering, but impulsive and can't control himself!
I won't make these two scoundrels! I have to find the giants first!
I will definitely become a guard!
Thank you, Jan! I did the right thing by following you!
Sasha Brause! She has a non-stereotypical brain, so she is not suitable for working in the team!
Conny Springer! She is good at maneuvering in a limited space, but does not have a sharp mind!
They are here!
Damn it! Mikasa went deeper!
Mikasa Ackerman! She is the best in all disciplines! Such geniuses appear once in a century!
Eren Yagami! She has a strong spirit, but not enough initiative!
I'm dead, but I brought my backpack myself!
Eren Yagami! She is the best in all disciplines! Such geniuses appear once in a century!
Eren JÃ¤ger! He has no special talents, but he is the most stubborn of our guys!
And he has a clear goal that will lead him to strong will!
Ouch!
Sorry! I didn't count on you!
Now you will be the attacker!
What's wrong?
Why is this training?
Soldiers should not fight with people!
And it's stupid to get into a fight if you are not armed!
You are mistaken!
We are soldiers!
Therefore, we must be able to fight under any circumstances!
With any enemy!
With the help of weapons or bare hands!
This is the duty of soldiers, defenders of the country!
Besides, look!
Oh, Annie!
She is not busy training again!
Eren! Let's teach this walker a lesson!
We will explain now what it means to be a soldier!
What if the teacher notices?
I understand why you are so ungrateful!
If you constantly lag behind from school, you will remain like this for the rest of your life!
Reiner, don't insult her!
She got angry!
She used to have an unpleasant look, but now ...
It's scary to look!
All right, let's get started!
Me?
Annie, you know what to do!
Defend yourself!
What?
She put a support!
I can go!
No! You have to take the knife from him!
Wait, Annie!
We have not been taught this!
Here!
Now it's your turn, right?
It's not necessary!
Attack, Reiner!
After all, this is the duty of every soldier! Remember?
Yes, a soldier does not choose his battles!
This is my destiny!
You are great at fighting! Who taught you?
Father!
Wow!
It does not matter!
The martial arts are useless for us!
Why is that?
The assessment of martial arts does not go to the score!
Most students fail!
Only 10 people who scored higher than all the points can join the guard!
They train with full dedication or too serious students!
Like you! Or just fools!
You noticed them!
Why do people who can fight giants spend their whole lives in security behind the walls?
Don't you think it's hypocrisy?
Who knows?
Because this is the real nature of people!
I will not dance to the tune of this stupid and false world!
I will not become a guard!
You can't be a soldier!
I tried so hard to become stronger, but I did not notice this contradiction!
They learn to fight against the giants!
They learn to fight against the giants in order to never meet them!
You can't do anything!
Since then, like the Palatine Maria, only a small reconnaissance unit fights against the giants!
We don't need society that much, so ...
You need to speed up, but strongly!
How do you save gas and maneuvering drive?
Yes, it's not that easy!
Well, yes, but not everyone is capable of this!
But it's better to remember this for the future, if you want to become a guard!
Yes, that would be nice!
There is nothing more honorable than to guard our king!
Hey, Mark!
Stop pretending, tell me honestly!
You want to join the guard to spend your whole life in security?
No, I don't serve for that!
In security?
A few years ago, it was also safe in Shiganshen!
What do you want to say?
Behind the walls or outside?
You will always be a villain!
Don't you think it's strange?
You are now learning to kill giants so that you will never meet them!
It's just come!
And I'm doing these stupid things to make my life!
You're just a bastard!
This is just reality!
Eren, stop it!
Stop it!
Are you kidding me?
Let go!
You'll tear your jacket!
How can you think now?
Yes, I understand.
He just gives me emotions.
Like I used to.
But I'm different.
I solve this situation thanks to my skills.
I'm a hero!
I'm a hero!
I'm a hero!
I'm a hero!
I'm a hero!
With situation thanks to my skills!
What was it?
The technique I learned while you were playing fool?
You believe to live in happiness and inclusivity?
And you think you're a soldier?
Why is it so noisy in the Kursanskaya canteen?
Explain it to me, please.
Sasha has released the gas.
Again!
Behave yourself!
And now, the 218th Kurs has completed its training.
Give me your heart!
Today, the graduates of the military school have three possible ways to continue their careers.
Become a wall defender and guard at one of its sites.
Or, if you are in danger, join the intelligence squad.
And you can also devote your life to serving the king in the National Guard.
Naturally, only 10 students with the highest score in the general score can enter there.
I've been waiting for so long.
Now I can definitely destroy the giants.
Mikasa Ackerman, Rainer Braun, Bertolt Fuber, Eni Leinhardt, Aaron Yager
Hooray! I became a guard!
We will always have food!
How did Aaron beat me?
Damn it!
You're going to be a guard!
Are you serious?
You were in the first ten!
I decided this from the very beginning.
I trained not to live my whole life behind the wall, but to fight the giants.
You can't beat them!
You understand it yourself.
We were all convinced of this when the fifth part of the population was destroyed.
Humanity will never defeat the giants!
So what?
Are you ready to give up just because you can't win?
Indeed.
In the past, humanity always lost, because we knew nothing about them.
We didn't know how to use weapons against the giants.
But the information we got during the clash with them gives us a lot of hope.
You propose to give up everything you've learned in the bloody struggle with the giants and admit to yourself that you're devout food?
I disagree.
I swear that I will destroy all the giants and get out of the wall.
This is my dream!
I believe that humanity has not yet lost this war!
Wait, Aaron!
Go behind the wall and fall!
And I must become a guard!
Aaron, you said it was your dream.
Yes.
Initially, it was your idea that we could get out of the wall.
I'm joining the intelligence squad!
Armin, you're in your right mind!
The theory of practice is important in the intelligence squad!
Let me die, but I'll be with you!
I'm coming with you too.
Mikasa, you're the best cadet!
Go to the guard!
If you join the guard, so will I.
If you decide to protect the wall, I'll go with you.
Because if I'm not with you, you'll die.
It's just stupid.
I don't want to lose my loved ones anymore.
I'm sorry.
This is the intelligence squad!
They're in the city!
Commander Armin!
Kill all the giants!
Look!
This is Corporal Levy!
And he's one of the whole intelligence squad!
We're sick of it!
It's not like it was four years ago!
All the people support the intelligence squad!
The Titans haven't been attacking for four years!
The people have calmed down!
And why did the cannons become garbage?
And the Titan Colossus doesn't attack us!
Well, yes!
What are you blabbering about?
Just like a husband and wife!
Aaron, don't say that!
Don't bother us!
Hi, guys!
Mr. Hannes?
Yesterday there was a graduation ceremony.
And I still remember you running around like kids.
You too, soldiers-drunkards, turned into a division commander!
Don't be rude!
I'm sorry.
I couldn't save your mother.
It's not your fault, Mr. Hannes.
We're not kids anymore.
It won't happen again.
We will defeat the giants!
I don't even know if you're good or bad.
Take care of yourself.
What?
You're joining the intelligence squad?
You wanted to go to the guard, didn't you?
Yeah, but...
It seems that your yesterday's speech affected him.
Shut up!
I decided it myself!
Don't be shy!
I'm coming too.
Thomas?
That's right!
Guys, look!
I took some meat from Mr. Kistalov.
Sasha, do you want to go to prison?
You're really a fool!
It's scary!
Let's share it with everyone.
Let's cut it, take some bread.
Come back to Earth.
Yes, people don't have much land.
Meat is a rare delicacy.
Don't worry.
After we return to our land,
we can breed cattle again.
I told you!
Aaron, leave Sasha alone!
Great! I'm with you!
Guys!
What are you waiting for?
If you don't work, we'll be suspected.
Yes, lunch is still far away.
Three years have passed.
Humanity is gradually returning to its circle.
We will win.
It's time to strike back.
Got you!
Come on!
Samuel!
Sasha!
You're not going anywhere!
Samuel, don't move!
She saved him!
What's that?
The wall of a hole!
The invasion continues!
We've got a giant!
I'll destroy them!
All of them, until the last one!
All of them, until the last one!
Take the battle positions!
It's time to strike back!
The target is right in front of us!
Titan Colossus! This is our chance!
We won't miss it!
Take this!
Well?
We haven't seen each other for a long time!
The sequel is coming!
That dream is a good place in the heart
It's easier to break than life
Throw it away as many times as you can
Sleep peacefully
It's time to wake up
Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up!
