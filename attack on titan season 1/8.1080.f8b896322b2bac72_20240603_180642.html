        <pre>In 850, Titan Colossus appeared again and broke another wall.
And again, people were helpless to stop the invasion.
One after the other, the fighters died from the hands of the titans.
Then...
Eren! Hurry!
Then Eren fell victim to them.
Mikasa is like a hurricane.
How does she get out?
Oh no, she is breaking into the fight to silence the shock.
I will win! I will live on!
When Mikasa was threatened with inevitable death, a mysterious titan appeared who attacked other titans.
Attack of the titans!
The titan fell to the ground without knowing the name of the broken flower.
The bird waited for the wind and prayed.
Nothing has changed.
The only thing that changes now is the fighting spirit.
The titan steps over the dead body and laughs.
The titan is dead.
The titan is dead.
The titan is dead.
The titan is dead.
The titan is dead.
The titan is dead.
The titan is dead.
The titan is dead.
The titan is dead.
The titan is dead.
The titan is dead.
The titan is dead.
The titan is dead.
Attention!
The battle for Rost.
Heartaraus.
So, the trigger seems to be working. I'll give you all my blades. Just leave me. It's short.
Perhaps I still don't want to be eaten alive.
Why?
Armin!
I won't leave you here.
Jumping on roofs, when titans are walking on the streets, and carrying someone else.
Let's go already.
Don't! Don't! Stop! Otherwise, because of me, another friend of mine will die!
Stop! Listen, I have a plan.
Plan?
Will you listen to me or not? Decide for yourself.
I know, it sounds crazy, but maybe we'll let him do this titan thing?
Titan?
He attacks other titans and doesn't touch us.
What if we lure him to the warehouse?
He will defeat the titans around him, and we will save our own.
Lure him, you say?
How interesting!
It seems that he attacks those who fall into the field of vision.
If you two deal with the titans walking nearby, he will go to look further.
Then, in theory, he will go to the headquarters.
This is called, if you're lucky, you can't do that!
What if we succeed?
Then we will deal with all the titans around the headquarters.
Let's take a risk.
Are you serious?
Yes, I'm serious.
It's better than sitting and waiting for death.
Let's try the plan of Armin.
To poison other titans with titans?
Yes, exactly.
What kind of idiots will we look like if we don't succeed?
But if we succeed, everyone will stay alive.
We need to prepare.
Okay, so be it.
Do I have the right to take responsibility for others?
No.
I'm wrong.
We need to act.
Now, when all the titans are there, we need to try.
Forward!
Let's break through to the headquarters.
Follow me!
There will be no other way.
When the gas runs out, we're done.
Hurry up!
Let's go!
ated
Jean!
Thanks.
Thanks to you we made it.
It's all you! I told you, you're a born leader!
Well, I don't know. Let's see.
Damn!
How long did it take you to get here?
I took the courage to decide their fate.
Someone died because of my order.
You're from the other side of the world, aren't you?
Yes.
You're from the Hux supply squad.
Stop it, Jean!
They left us there!
How many people died because the gas ran out?
The storage room was torn apart by the titans. What could we do?
Whatever! You were taught this!
Get down!
Damn!
There are too many of us in one place!
Get out of here!
We won't have time to get out!
Where's Mikasa?
We've been eating her without gas for a long time!
That's how it should be.
This is reality.
It turns out that my hope is just a dream.
I should have known earlier what was really going on.
It wasn't so hard to guess that we wouldn't be able to defeat such monstrous enemies.
What?
What the hell is that?
Mikasa!
Wow! The gas ran out, but we barely made it.
Did you make it?
Well done, Armin!
Your plan worked!
Listen!
This titan is dealing with other titans.
And he doesn't touch people.
With his help, we can escape!
With the help of a titan?
The titan assistant sounds like a fairy tale.
It's not a fairy tale.
I don't care who he is and where he came from.
We need him here, in battle.
If we want to survive, this is our most real opportunity.
The fans are turned by the gas flow on the blade.
The gas pressure can be adjusted.
Comparative sizes of titans.
Don't be afraid.
This titan is stronger than the rest.
While he's setting the fire there, they won't touch the warehouse.
Do you know a lot about titans?
I know a lot about titans.
I know a lot about titans.
I know a lot about titans.
Do you know a lot about titans?
It's not the time to guess.
We need to get out of here.
All right.
We'll get out of here.
Found it!
Guards' weapons!
It's all dusty.
Will they work?
I don't know if the weapons are powerful enough against the titans.
It's better than nothing.
There are seven three-meter and four-meter titans in the warehouse.
These weapons will be enough for us to blind them all at once.
First, the main group will go down the elevator to the center of the room and shoot at the seven titans at the same time.
To blind them.
Then it will be important to act together.
All together.
Seven of us.
We will hide on the ceiling beams in advance and together attack the blinded titans from the ambush.
That is, our salvation will depend on one exact joint blow.
Seven people must kill seven titans at the same time.
And, of course, we must select the smartest fighters.
However, I would not want to put the responsibility on their shoulders for the lives of everyone else.
Do not worry.
If we fail, everyone will die, no matter who we choose.
The risk is the same.
But I'm not quite sure that this plan is the best.
We have no other choice.
There is no time to wait.
We will act according to the plan.
We just have to try our best.
Do not be afraid.
You know how to make the right decision.
You have already saved me and Eren with this.
I do not understand.
When?
The elevator is ready.
Guns too.
Everything is loaded.
Only until you understand this.
We'll talk later.
And still, will we overcome the titans without our drives?
Easy.
They are no more than four meters.
It will not be difficult to get to them.
Yes.
No matter what size.
Our goal is the same area on the neck.
One meter by ten centimeters.
Or you can use your legs to drive the blade.
This is their second vulnerable place.
I hear first.
Is that true?
I did not know about this before.
Reiner, these words may be the last words for you.
Ferocious!
People.
I did not see any other.
We have to start.
Calm down! Let him come closer!
Wait!
We shoot at them to be sure.
We'll miss and all of us will die.
We'll finish them all at once.
Wait!
Are we waiting?
Get ready!
Fire!
Who is it?
There is!
How are you?
I'm sorry.
I...
Damn!
I didn't want to attack you from behind.
Sasha and the horses are in trouble!
Help them!
I beg you!
I beg you!
Spare me!
I beg you!
Spare me!
Mikasa!
You saved me!
You're not wounded?
Thanks to you, I'm not.
Then get up.
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
Well, well.
Here you were, Kami.
It's a miracle that you didn't get hurt.
We put them all!
You can get ready!
Hooray!
Well, that's it.
Saved!
Titans don't get in anymore.
Our Titan is fighting with them.
I turned out to be completely helpless.
What a shame!
You will despise yourself later.
Now you have to get out.
Perhaps I'm not fit to be a leader.
Don't say that anymore.
I hope you don't get angry.
But you're not very strong.
Therefore, you understand how weak he is.
In addition, you quickly grasp the situation.
You immediately realized what to do.
And you gave the right order.
I jumped after you.
And that's why I'm alive.
Everyone is ready!
Let's get out of here!
Let's stick together!
Let's climb the walls!
Let's find the others!
Mikasa!
Mikasa!
Run faster!
That's the Titan.
They're eating him.
He can't heal the wounds.
If we had studied this mysterious Titan,
then perhaps
we would have found a way to make our fate easier.
That's right.
If they eat him, we won't know anything.
Let's protect him.
Let's split into those who climb to him.
Are you crazy, Reiner?
We can finally leave.
Reiner is right.
What if he helps us?
He will be better than any gun.
Isn't that right?
Will he help?
Yes.
Will he help us?
He's a good guy.
Look!
It's the runaway who ate Thomas.
Listen!
Why should we protect him?
Why should we protect him?
I think he's out of his mind.
Enough of me!
Let's get out of here!
He won't help us.
He's the Titan.
The Titan.
What else?
What else?
Mikhail!
Mikhail!
Mikhail!
Mikhail!
Eren!
It's Eren!
Both his hand and his leg were bitten off.
I saw it myself.
The Titan swallowed him.
With his own eyes.
What does it mean?
What does it mean?
So, it's all...
Eren fought them.
To be continued.
To be continued.
To be continued.
To be continued.
To be continued.
