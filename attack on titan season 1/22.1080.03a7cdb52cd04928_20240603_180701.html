        <pre>After the death of his friends, Eren turns into a giant and enters the battle.
But he lost. The Titan woman absorbs Eren.
Eren, wait! Give Eren back!
Wherever she goes, I'll kill her.
I'll evaporate and get you out of there, out of this shit. I promise.
I'm sorry, Eren. Just be patient. Just a little more.
Stop!
What?
Hold on while you can.
Stop!
Attack of the Titans
Episode 57
Attack of the Titans
Episode 57
Defeat
Defeat of the Titans
Keep this distance. She's running slowly.
She must have been exhausted too.
She ate the head of that giant.
Do you think Eren is alive?
Alive!
The Titans have the knowledge.
Her goal is to kidnap Eren.
After all, she could just kill him.
She's holding him in her mouth.
It would be more convenient to run away from us.
Perhaps she swallowed Eren.
Then he's inside her belly.
Most likely he's dead.
He's alive!
I hope so.
And first of all, if you had protected Eren better, this wouldn't have happened.
Everything's clear. You're one of those three.
Eren's friend.
Let's determine our goals.
First, we won't kill the Titans.
But she killed a lot of our soldiers.
Nothing will come out of us until she closes her neck.
Do what I say.
I hope Eren is alive and we'll do everything to save him.
Before she leaves the forest.
I'll attack, and you distract her.
Eren!
Eren!
Eren!
Eren!
Eren!
Eren!
Eren!
Eren!
Eren!
Eren!

Eren!
Eren!
Eren!
Eren!
Eren!
It's fast!
It can't even hold it back!
Take this!
She opened the door!
She probably can't move!
I'll kill her!
Stop!
Eren!
Eren!
Hey!
We're retreating!
Eren!
He's breathing!
He's still alive!
He's so dirty!
We won't try to kill her!
We're retreating!
Do you remember what the plan was?
Do you want to avenge your enemy?
Or is your life more important?
No!
Please!
I just...
They're back already?
What happened to them?
What difference does it make?
They must be carrying dead bodies with them again!
The intelligence squad is coming back.
I see.
I hope Luo will have time to look around the house.
I cooked a lot of food, darling.
Gunter is back.
I see.
Let's go.
I'll never get used to this.
It's hard for everyone.
What kind of death awaits our friends?
And what about us?
I'm tired of thinking about it.
I'm trying not to think about it.
If I imagine my own death,
I probably won't be able to fight.
You know, you're probably right.
How long are we going to hold out?
But we survived this time.
This time, yes.
But it's good.
We're still alive.
The dead wouldn't like your words.
Maybe we'll never come back to our homeland.
We're almost done.
We couldn't find five bodies.
Not a single part.
Some bodies were born as giants.
Maybe it would be better not to return them to their families at all.
Get rid of them.
The watchmen found several giants near the forest,
but none of them are heading our way.
We're leaving now.
Give it to all units.
Yes, sir.
Commander Irwin, this is wrong.
What are you doing?
We need to take the bodies.
I know where Ivan's body is.
It's not far.
But there are giants walking around.
It's a secret.
It's a secret.
It's not far.
But there are giants walking around.
It's too dangerous.
If the giants attack, we'll just kill them.
We've been friends with Ivan since childhood.
And we know his parents.
So we want to return at least the body.
Are you crazy?
Are you children?
Capral Levi.
We know he's dead, and that's enough.
Whether we return the body or not, it won't change anything.
He's not here.
How can that be?
Ivan's group is missing.
This is my final decision.
What are you doing?
What's wrong with you?
There's nothing human left!
Watch your tongue!
Quiet!
The intelligence team's cart is equipped with a special suspension and super-strength steel,
which can only be made at the city factory.
A horse can carry such a cart at a speed of 20 km per hour.
What's that?
It's a giant!
Is that...
Jita!
What a fool!
The giant has been spotted in the rear view!
Full speed ahead!
There are no tall trees or houses here.
It's going to be hard to fight.
We need to move towards the wall.
They're going to catch us!
We can't fight them!
They won't help us in the field of fire!
Besides, look!
There's no end to them!
That's true!
What can we do?
We can't fight them!
We can't fight them!
We can't fight them!
We can't fight them!
We can't fight them!
We can't fight them!
Jita, what can we do?
I don't know.
We're too slow!
I'll go behind you and distract him.
And you...
Don't!
It's better to throw your bodies away.
How can you do that?
What are you saying?
We can't always return the bodies of our soldiers.
We can't do anything about it.
We can't do anything about it.
We can't do anything about it.
We can't do anything about it.
We can't do anything about it.
We can't do anything about it.
You can't do anything about it.
It happens.
You'll throw them out!
You'll really throw them out!
Damn it!
We have no choice!
We have no choice!
It's working!
Keep going!
Confirm the position.
We're leaving.
Be careful!
We'll take the east side now.
Levi picked it up.
Excuse me.
For me, this is the memory of them.
The evidence of their lives.
This is Ivan's emblem.
Cabral!
We're leaving!
Eren, forget about the reconnaissance squad.
What?
Are you going to laugh at the reconnaissance squad too?
It's not that I'm laughing.
The reconnaissance squad is back!
The outer gates are opening!
Let's go!
Meet the heroes!
Is this everyone who came back?
Everyone else was eaten.
It's because they went out behind the walls of the city.
Thanks to such an outburst, the giants will only get thicker and stronger!
Eren!
What's wrong with you?
What's wrong with you?
What's wrong with you?
What's wrong with you?
What's wrong with you?
Eren!
Eren!
Eren!
Don't get up.
You're too weak.
What's wrong with the titans?
She ran away.
She ran away?
We didn't take her?
Mikasa.
How's our operation?
It failed.
Have a rest.
So what?
I don't know.
I don't know.
So what?
So you saved me this time.
We'll be back soon.
Have a rest.
It seems that there were a lot more of them this morning.
Yes, a lot.
It was a hard trip.
They only left the city in the morning, and now they're back.
What were they doing there?
Who knows.
But according to the sad physiognomy, it is clear that nothing happened to them.
As always, it is best for them to lose people.
Eren, be patient.
Wow!
The scouts are so brave!
They continue to fight despite the great losses.
Levy!
My daughter is serving you.
I'm Petr's father.
I wanted to talk to you before I saw my daughter.
She sent me a letter.
She wrote that she was assigned to your brigade.
She is going to devote her life to you.
She is going to devote her life to you.
She wrote that she is going to devote her life to you.
She is going to devote her life to you.
She has completely forgotten about her old parents and only thinks about you.
As a father, I decided to talk to you.
I think it's too early for her to get married.
She is too young.
Let her see life first.
Commander Erwin, what happened there?
Tell me, did you achieve something in today's campaign?
Did all these soldiers die in vain?
The losses of the scouts during this campaign were huge.
People stopped believing in him, and the squad lost popularity.
Erwin and the other commanders were called to the capital for a report.
Eren's fate was decided.
