In 845, when the Titan Colossus and the Armored Titan emerged from nowhere and broke the wall, our life completely changed.
People left the wall of Mariaki, losing the fifth part of the population and the third part of their land.
Now the territory of people was limited by the Rose Wall.
In 850, the Titan Colossus appeared again and broke another wall.
And again, people were helpless to stop the invasion.
One by one, the soldiers died from the hands of the Titans.
And finally...
Eren!
No!
Eren Jäger was eaten by a giant.
He was reborn from the flesh of a defeated giant.
Attention!
Dod Pixis, the commander-in-chief of the southern territories, realized what power Eren had, turning into a giant.
He decides to use this power to save the city.
He will turn into a giant, take a huge stone, drag it to the wall and shut them up.
If this plan succeeds, then humanity will for the first time in history conquer its territory from the giants.
This small step will be the first step of humanity to victory over the giants.
However, right after the beginning of the operation, something went wrong.

We finally managed to gather most of the giants in this part of the city.
Despite the fact that we avoided the battle, we lost the fifth part of the soldiers.
We did not lose them. Their death was not in vain.
They died following my order.
The fate of mankind is on the map.
I will do everything to keep the human race going.
Let them call me a butcher even later.
Go, parliament!
Ackerman!
Oh, my God!
Ackerman! Stop! Get away from there!
Eren! Do you recognize me?
I am Mikasa! I am your family!
You have to take this stone and close the hole!
The operation failed.
I've always known that we don't have any secret weapons.
Eren! You're a human! You're my friend!
Ackerman! Back off!
He's not our ally. He's just an ordinary, dumb giant.
Eren!
Eren! Two giants are approaching! A 10-meter one and a 40-meter one!
And a 12-meter one behind us too!
We're coming back!
This guy won't be able to shut you up.
Yes. We have no choice. We'll leave him here.
The defenders used the red signal.
Looks like they've got some serious problems.
It's all in vain. My friends died in vain.
Guys, look!
What's going on?
A fight!
They didn't make it.
Why?
Why?
Armin, where are you going?
Commander-in-Chief, we need to keep defending the gate. We're going in.
No.
Let the team come back.
No. Continue to lure the giants out of the city center.
As for the front-line squad, let them sort it out on the spot.
They're not just smart warriors. They're elite soldiers whom we entrusted with our fate.
I'm sure they won't give up so easily.
They won't let their friends die in vain.
Our warriors will fight to the very end.
We have no choice. We need to retreat.
Ian, it's not your fault.
It's just that this plan is unrealistic.
We all support you.
Of course, it was worth trying, but it didn't work out.
Now our squad has to go back to the wall.
Wait!
Wait.
What's going on?
Rico's group.
You'll take 12 meters.
Metabi's group.
Two others.
What?
I'm the commander. You have to obey me.
We won't leave Jäger without protection.
We continue the operation.
We have to protect Jäger and bring him back to the base.
He's very valuable to humanity.
We can't leave him here.
Unlike us, he has unique skills.
It's just an unsuccessful experiment.
A few hundred soldiers died because of him today.
And you want to bring him back and repeat this operation?
Yes. No matter how many people died, we will try again.
What happened to Aaron?
The army went there. I hope he's all right.
Do you hope so?
I'm sure everything is fine.
I'm sure.
Aaron can do it.
Gather all the giants on the outskirts of the city.
Why do you need this?
If we tried to kill them, a lot of soldiers would have died.
We can't lose people now.
So all those who died today died in vain?
We will start the offensive soon.
And for this we will need all our forces.
We need to try to save as many soldiers as possible.
That's it.
Do you understand?
Then let's try to survive, guys.
Ian, are you out of your mind?
You have another plan to defeat the giants.
In this case, tell me.
How can we cope with this situation?
How not to allow a large number of casualties?
What force can we oppose the power of the giants?
I can't imagine how else we can defeat the giants.
You see, we have to continue the mission.
We have no choice.
We have to do everything to protect it.
Even sacrifice our friends.
Sacrifice our lives.
Maybe it's not fair, but that's all that's left for us now.
Rico, what have you decided?
We have only one way.
Fight to the end.
I will never accept this.
Rico!
I will obey you.
I think everything you said is right.
We have to show the giants what kind of freaks we can be.
I will not give my life for nothing.
We take on a 12-meter giant.
Let's go.
We have two.
Yes.
Thank you, Commander Ian.
You're welcome.
Dr. Ackerman.
You had such a look that I was even scared.
Act according to your discretion.
You know how to use your skills best.
Yes.
You have to protect your loved one.
He's my family.
What?
His limbs are not recovering.
Is there a limit to regeneration?
What will happen to Aaron?
I can't even be sure that he will turn into a human again.
No.
There is no point in thinking about it now.
Now I have to protect him.
Aaron!
Rico!
What happened there?
Equipment allows you to transfer weight to one leg.
The person is as if steaming in the air.
But this creates a very powerful sensation.
During training, teachers cut the ropes of rock climbers, deliberately complicating the task.
What is it?
Where am I?
I don't understand what's going on.
Am I sitting?
I don't see anything.
Is it morning or evening?
What kind of place is this?
It can't be.
I'm at home.
I'll sleep some more.
Aaron!
What have you done to Aaron?
Did you hear?
We have to keep the giants in this part of the city.
We are playing the bait.
Do you understand?
There is no point in going into battle.
Divide into groups of three and run around the earth.
As soon as the giants are nearby, immediately jump up.
And we will deal with the giants who will not go after you.
There will be a lot of giants.
There will be a lot of giants.
Approximately every tenth.
Commander, in case of danger, we can act at our discretion.
The main thing is to survive.
Gerstein's squad, forward!
Yes!
There is another one from behind.
Thirteen-meter men are heading for the Jäger.
The giants also appeared from the holes in the wall.
Four ten-meter men.
Ackermann, cover us.
Yes, sir.
Don't let them get close to the Jäger.
Stop them.
Yes, sir.
We are certainly the best fighters, but there are too many giants.
It's strange.
Why are there so many giants coming here?
There are few people here.
Could it be?
Eren is luring them.
Mikasa!
Mikasa!
Mikasa!
Mikasa!
Mikasa!
Mikasa!
Mikasa!
Mikasa!
Mikasa!
Mikasa!
Mikasa!
Mikasa!
Mikasa!
What happened here?
Armin!
What happened to Eren?
Get away from him.
Eren's consciousness doesn't control the giants.
He didn't react to me.
So you can't even try.
What's the plan?
We failed.
They're going to kill us all!
The back of the head and the top of the back.
One meter up.
Ten centimeters to the side.
Armin!
I'm going to get Aaron out of the giant!
Mikasa, cover us until I get him out!
What do you want to do?
Aaron got out of the most ferocious place of the giants.
Probably, it has something to do with the origin of the giants.
I can handle it.
The main thing is not to cut the middle.
He won't die.
But maybe I'll slightly touch him with my sword.
Forgive me!
Armin!
Armin, stop it immediately!
Mikasa!
Do what you're a professional at!
You can save many of our soldiers!
Go, I'll take care of Aaron!
Aaron, do you hear me?
Aaron, get a grip!
If you don't get out of the giant, we're all going to die!
You have to save all of us!
Aaron, you have to get out of this giant as soon as possible!
Get out of the giant?
Why?
I just want to sleep.
Aaron!
Get out!
Hurry!
Aaron!
Aaron!
Don't you want to take revenge for your mother?
You were going to destroy all the titans!
You hate the giant who ate your mother!
You're wrong, Armin.
My mother is here.
Aaron!
Please wake up, Aaron!
You hear me, Aaron!
If you don't get out, you'll be killed by the giants!
Your life will end!
Armin, I don't understand what you're talking about.
Why do I have to get out?
I don't understand.
Why do I have to get out?
Why do I have to join the reconnaissance squad?
We'll have to act according to the circumstances.
I'm coming.
Finally, the giant is dead, damn it!
Back off!
I'm back!
I'm going to the Demetabi brigade!
What?
John!
Run!
Run!
I won't let anyone die because of me!
Damn it!
The gun is broken!
Damn it!
John!
What happened?
Why doesn't he use his gun?
No way!
His gun is broken!
It's okay, we'll make it!
Damn it, Flip!
Now I have to save myself!
It's okay, I'll think of something.
Eren!
Eren!
Eren!
Eren!
Remember when we wanted to go outside, behind the wall?
We were going to go far, far away.
To see the sandy deserts and the icy plains.
Where the horizon is endless.
Where my father and mother tried to go.
Did you think I forgot about all this?
We stopped talking about freedom because you were afraid that I would go to the reconnaissance squad.
The world is behind the walls.
Eren!
Answer me!
Now, behind the walls of the city, there is a real hell waiting for us.
Perhaps a cruel death awaits us, just like my father and mother.
I've always thought, why do you need the outer world so much?
Why?
It's obvious.
Because I was born in this world!
The sequel follows.
The End
The End
The End
Go. Run. Live.
Eren heads towards the door with hope.
