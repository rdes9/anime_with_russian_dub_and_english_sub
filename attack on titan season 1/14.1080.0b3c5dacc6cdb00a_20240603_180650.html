        <pre>Hey, answer already, you bastard!
What do you want?
I want to get into the intelligence and kill them all!
All together!
Oh, not bad.
Irwin, I'll take him under my care.
So give the command.
Not because I trust him.
If he betrays us or blunders, I'll kill him on the spot.
No one can do this except me.
So it is unlikely that someone will object.
Your wish is accepted.
To be your agent.
No one can do this except me.
So it is unlikely that someone will object.
SFA
Nothing could have continued without you.
Until you become the very last one.
Attack of the Titans
Night before the attack, still in the dark
Night before the attack, still in the dark
Listen, is it true that the titan has appeared, who is on the side of people?
This is no more than rumours.
It may be that we will not be able to fight off our lands at all.
A bunch of refugees will run away from us from the Rose Wall.
Behind the Wall?
Then there will definitely not be enough food for everyone.
Hunger will begin.
And what if this titan gets along with them here?
What if he comes to his head to attack us?
The Wall of Shines and the Rose Wall.
Come!
Miracle!
Now the titan is fighting for us!
Maybe we'll even return the Wall of Mary!
I'm not afraid of that word!
He is our saviour!
The saviour!
The saviour means...
People are always so easy-going.
Maybe he is used to rebel against the authorities?
You can't let that happen.
The task of the guards is to destroy Terran Yeager.
He should not get to that kind of intelligence.
Terran!
Greetings, Commander-in-Chief!
It's so hot!
Pixis,
aren't you afraid that some people may not come to the personal meeting of the commander of the garrison
with the intelligence commander?
I hear that you are very careful.
You think I just accidentally ran into you during the morning walk?
We walked together and talked about the deserts.
You know that the guards also want to get Terran Yeager.
Yes.
I was informed yesterday.
It will be decided at the tribunal.
Also,
it is up to the garrison to decide who to hand over the intelligence or the guards to.
The garrison?
Commander-in-Chief Darius Zakli?
The garrison commander, the garrison intelligence commander,
is the commander of all military forces.
The only thing that matters to him is the benefit for humanity.
If he sees a threat to the garrison,
he will sentence him right on the spot and will not blink an eye.
I don't want Eren to die,
but many of my people are afraid of him.
You can't do anything.
All I can do is speak against the garrison in this matter.
Do you think it will work?
I don't think so.
But I'm ready to make an offer to them.
Whether they will listen or not depends on how the trial goes.
So you don't know until you see it yourself.
I understood one thing,
until you see it yourself, you won't know anything.
Perhaps you are not as simple as you seem.
Thank you for the fascinating conversation, Smith.
The investigation has begun because of Eren.
But why?
I don't know.
It looks like they are deciding how to deal with him.
What do you mean, how to deal with him?
Probably kill him or not.
Mikasa Ackerman! Armin Arlert!
Do you have such people?
Yes.
You are ordered to appear in the court today as witnesses.
I need to go to the toilet.
I just went.
Water, please.
Hey!
It's a miracle.
You'd better sit quietly and don't stand out.
I'm a monster for them?
Maybe I'm really not a human?
They are so afraid of me that they even got me with chains.
Well, you can understand them.
I'm not afraid of them.
I guess I'm lucky that they haven't killed me yet.
But Mikasa and Armin were not afraid of me at all.
Where are they now?
And the others?
How are they there?
We need a little more time.
We'll try to persuade them.
It's been a few days.
What's going on outside now?
I won't stay here, locked up, for the rest of my life.
So, here you are, Eren.
How are you?
Does it hurt?
Sorry for taking so long.
But we're finally going to let you out.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
We'll let you out, but you'll have to wear something.
I'm the commander of the one of the reconnaissance units, Hangi Zoya.
And this is Miki Zaharius, the commander of another unit.
I'm sorry.
He has such a habit of smelling new acquaintances and bawling.
Although there's no point in that, I guess.
But he's a good fighter.
That's what he was made a commander for.
I'm sorry.
I talked too much with you.
We're already here.
Okay, don't be upset.
Maybe even better,
that I didn't have time to explain everything to you.
Wait a minute!
I know it's rude,
but we'll have to completely rely on you.
Good luck!
A tribunal?
I'm in a tribunal?
Step forward!
An extraordinary tribunal,
a military court for those who serve in the army.
Unlike the usual tribunal,
politics is heavily influenced here.
The sentence is issued by the Chief Commander, Darius Zakhli.
On your knees!
Why are they here?
Why?
And why this court?
Are you here?
Yes.
Well, let's get started.
So you are Eren Yeager.
You gave an oath to serve the people
and be ready to die for them.
Am I right?
Yes, sir.
Our case is exclusive.
It is not covered by civil law,
but by the sound tribunal.
The final decision is entirely up to me.
Your fate will be decided here.
I knew it!
Any objections?
No, sir.
Good listening.
I'll get straight to the point.
As expected,
it is impossible to hide your existence.
We need to somehow explain it
to the public.
Otherwise, we may have
another threat.
Besides the titans.
Today I have to decide
who will take care of you.
Will it be the guard
or the intelligence service?
Guard,
I have a word for you.
Yes, sir.
I am the commander of the Nile Dock Guard.
I will make my offer.
We believe that we should
investigate him thoroughly,
and then eliminate him.
We admit that his abilities
have helped us to stop
the endless series of defeats.
However,
his existence now threatens us
with a split and civil war.
We ask him to sacrifice himself
for the sake of humanity.
The knowledge he has acquired
will benefit us.
We don't need any research
for the sake of this disgusting heretic.
He has turned the wall upside down.
The wall breaker?
Five years ago, no one listened to them.
The walls have not risen.
Now we will listen to the offer
of the intelligence service.
Yes, sir.
I am the commander of the 13th intelligence unit
Irwin Smith. I offer
to take Eren into our ranks
as a full-fledged fighter
and with his help
destroy the wall of Mary.
That's all.
That's all?
Yes. His power
can bring us back to our land.
I believe that
we should do something more.
I see.
By the way, where do you want
to start acting?
Pixis.
I see.
The rose has finally been touched.
Yes.
We can't go through it anymore.
We are planning to
leave the Caranes in the east.
From there we will move to Shiganshina.
We may need to
clarify the route along the way.
Wait!
Isn't it better to touch
these gates silently?
Titan Colossus can only
break the gates. We can
not be afraid of the attack.
Shut up!
With this Titan we can
return to the wall of Mary!
Plasmonia of greatness!
We can not let you down!
You're talking too much
with your swine.
Do you think the Titans will wait
until we touch the gates?
Who do you call us?
Your friends
with whom you drink company?
I have no place to hang
bread. They are hungry.
And they saw your
copious brother with your
smart people in the coffin.
We just believe that if we touch
the gates, it will help us to survive.
Shut up!
You're a treacherous traitor!
So that the common mortals
can change the rose of God!
Only the blind do not see
that a man is unable to do
something like this!
Because of them,
it was impossible to put
a gun on the wall.
Shut up!
Shut up!
You and the saints
did not give a word at all!
What?
Silence!
You can discuss your views
on the world in another place.
J채ger, I would like
to clarify something.
Are you capable of being
in the form of the Titan
and continue to fight
on the side of people?
But in the report,
where the defense is described,
it is simply said that
immediately after turning into the Titan,
Mikasa Ackermann was
caught.
He does not remember
that he could not control himself.
He wants me to lie,
and in the report
hiding the truth is not the best
way to save humanity.
Is Mikasa Ackermann here?
Yes, I'm here.
Is it true that J채ger
attacked you in the form of the Titan?
Lies will not help Eren,
and do not hope.
Yes, it's true.
As I thought,
the Titan is the Titan.
I tried to kill Mikasa.
Me?
But before that,
Eren twice
saved me from
death in the same form.
Once,
when I was almost caught by
another Titan,
he came forward
and protected me.
The second time,
when he closed me with Armin
from the explosive shell,
I ask you to consider
this too.
Obviously,
she is under strong influence
of her own feelings.
Mikasa Ackermann lost her parents
when she was a child,
and J채ger adopted her.
Also,
our investigation found
an unusual fact
related to this event.
At the age of 9,
Eren, J채ger
and Mikasa Ackermann
killed three criminals
when they tried to kidnap her.
Even if it was self-defense,
it says a lot
about their human qualities.
We managed to trust
his fate, hope
and the life of all mankind.
Exactly!
This Titan pretended to be a child
and infiltrated us.
And she too.
How do we know that she is a human?
Wait!
Even if I am a monster,
she is not guilty of anything!
Not at all!
How did we believe it?
This is true!
If you protect her,
she is the same as you!
Bullshit!
I was angry,
but you are not right.
You put everything under your control.
How convenient is it for you?
Think about it yourself!
Is it reasonable?
Have any of you ever seen a Titan?
Why are you so afraid?
Maybe it's better to be silent?
No!
I will tell them everything!
Everything I think!
When those who have the ability
and the strength
do not want to fight,
it's stupid!
If you are afraid to fight for your life,
then help me!
Bullshit!
What?
You must support me!
Aim at him!
Got it!
Stop, Mikasa!
I may be wrong,
but I think
nothing is as uneducated as pain.
You need to be explained something.
You need to be trained.
Yes,
and it is more convenient to kick
the one who is on his knees.
Wait!
Levi!
What's the matter?
It's dangerous!
What if he gets angry again
and turns into a Titan?
What are you talking about?
Do you want to execute him
or do you want to hit him on the head?
When he overpaid last time,
he managed to kill
two dozen Titans.
If he is our enemy,
they will make him
a much more terrible enemy.
Not me, of course.
But what are you going to do?
Anyone who wants to
make excuses about him
should think about whether he is sure
that he will be killed.
Your honor, I have an offer.
I'm listening.
We still do not know
what Eren is capable of as a Titan.
Ignorance hides danger.
That's why I
offer Levi the commander
to take Eren's advice
and organize an expedition
behind the scenes.
With Eren's help?
Yes.
According to the results of the expedition,
we will be able to judge if Eren is capable
to control the Titan's forces
and what it will be for people,
salvation or curse.
Can you do it, Levi?
I can kill him whenever I want.
Will I be able to tame him
and at the same time
not kill him?
I'm not sure.
So it's decided.
Yeah, you got a good one.
Does it hurt?
A little bit.
How exactly does it hurt?
It hurts.
I'm sorry.
But it was necessary
for you to surrender to us.
I understand.
Your suffering allowed me
to make a good move in time.
My respects.
Eren, I hope we'll work it out.
Yes, I'll be very happy.
Tell me, Eren.
Yes.
Are you mad at me?
No.
I understand why I had to do it.
Okay.
But you over-tried.
By the way, you knocked out his tooth.
See?
Why did you pick it up?
It's disgusting to look at.
But it's a valuable sample.
Eren, believe me,
I'm more merciful than she is.
Don't talk too much.
I'm not going to kill him for nothing.
Listen, Eren.
Let me see your mouth.
There.
The new tooth has grown.
Let's continue.
THE END
THE END
THE END
THE END
