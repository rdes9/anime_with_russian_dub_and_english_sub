        <pre>In 845, when the titan colossus and the armored titan emerged from nowhere, they broke through the wall, our life completely changed.
People left the wall of Mary, losing the fifth part of the population and the third part of their land. Now the territory of people was limited by the wall of roses.
And so, in 850, humanity could not withstand the invasion of the giants again. Aaron Yeager, eaten by the titan, was reborn from the flesh of a defeated giant.

Answer
I ask you again, who are you really?
Man!
That's it!
Don't hold back!
Marco, this is the end!
I can't fight anymore!
Why?
My friends ate me in the eyes!
I saw how they ate, but I didn't feel hatred or sadness!
I just thanked fate that I wasn't in their place!
No, I'm next!
I realized it!
Now being a soldier means fighting with the giants until they eat you!
If they still eat me, I'd better go myself!
Das, calm down!
You're not the only one who saw it!
We're all fighting with our fears!
Look at Sasha!
She's calm, despite everything we've been through!
My stomach hurts!
Write me down as wounded!
We're doomed!
Calm down!
No!
We swore not to talk!
Their moral spirit is torn!
What if they found out about Eren?
A shot?
Why is there only one?
Look, smoke is coming out!
It's inside the wall!
What is it?
What's going on?
What is it?
Are the old gates broken?
But these are the strongest gates!
Maybe some plant dropped the core?
But then why is there so much smoke?
Maybe the Titan is evaporating?
Wait!
Where are you going?
Who will explain to me what's going on here?
It's alive!
Commander Wehrmann!
Wait!
It's too dangerous to get close!
Take the defensive position and get out of here!
Don't attack!
Recharge your guns immediately!
What is it?
I remember how the cannon shot!
Then I heard some noise and felt the fire!
And now we are inside the skeleton.
Eren protected us.
This is the most important thing now.
Why are flowers growing inside?
Armin, aren't you wounded?
Eren, what have you done?
I don't know.
But soon they will shoot again.
It's like a giant's body.
It's better to go away.
They decided to watch the situation.
It seems that now they are not going to attack us.
But most likely they will shoot again.
And they will hardly want to talk after seeing it.
I just remembered one important thing.
About the basement.
The basement of our house.
If we get into it, we will understand everything.
Maybe there is an answer to the questions.
Why did I become like this?
And what are giants?
Why did you hide it, father?
How many scouts have sacrificed their lives trying to get this information?
This is the hope of humanity.
And all this information is in our basement?
What did you think?
I don't understand.
And in general, where did you get these five shits?
Eren, stop flying in the clouds.
The fog is spreading.
Just see the fire.
We need to get it.
Don't move.
Stop!
Guys, I'm leaving.
Where?
Why?
I don't know exactly.
We need to cross the wall and find the basement.
We have to turn into a giant.
Will you make it?
I don't know yet how, but I'll get there.
I can do it.
After all, I can turn into a giant, even though I don't know how.
At that moment, I was only thinking about how to protect us from the core.
That's why I created a giant that was only capable of this.
Now we need something more powerful.
We need to create a 15-meter giant, like that time.
Eren!
Eren!
You have blood.
And you're also pale, and you're breathing.
Your body can't take it anymore.
It doesn't matter what happens to my body.
I have two plans.
If you don't protect me, you won't be killed.
I'm sorry for dragging you into all this.
From now on, I will act on my own.
What?
What about me?
Eren?
I'm with you.
No.
If I don't have time, you can leave me.
But I don't have to obey you.
Think about it, finally.
I'm not your younger brother, and I'm not your son.
The yeast is grown behind the wall of the tire.
The collected yeast is stored with beans and grains, which prevents rot.
In each district there was a grain storage facility with grains and yeast.
Commander, the weapons are ready for battle.
We will attack.
What do you command?
Wait for my signal.
Yes, sir.
It seems that at the moment they are not going to fight us.
Otherwise, Mikasa would have felt it and warned.
If you take into account the minimum time, the reload will take another 20 seconds.
During this time, Eren will probably come up with a way to get us out of here.
Why am I remembering that case at such a time?
Is this the end?
Will we never see each other again?
I was a coward until the very end.
Unfortunately, I could not become anyone else.
They saved me many times.
But there was no chance for me to help them.
And after that, my tongue turns to call myself a friend.
Why can't I say that I'll go with them so that it doesn't happen?
I'm not sure I won't get in the way.
This is the end of our friendship.
We will never be together again.
Eren, I want to...
Wait.
I'll tell you about the second Tvani.
Armin, the future depends on you.
Even I understand how unrealistic it is what I just told you.
The most logical thing would be to use my power, the power of the giant, to help people.
I understand.
This is impossible.
But if there is a chance that you will be able to prove to the military that I do not represent a threat, then I am ready to trust you.
This is my second plan.
If you think that you will not succeed, then I will do as I said before.
You have to make a decision in 15 seconds.
In any case, I will respect your choice.
Eren, why do you trust me such an important decision?
Because in difficult situations, you often found the right path, and I decided to trust you.
As to myself.
When did this happen?
Several times. For example, five years ago.
If you didn't call Mr. Hannes, we would have been eaten by the giants.
It was just my fears.
Eren doesn't think like that.
It was me who decided that I was not capable of anything and would be confused.
And they never thought about me anything like that.
Army, we have no time.
Guns are overloaded.
You can shoot.
They are ready to trust me with their lives.
I didn't know that there are people in this world who trust me so much.
It's for the sake of such people.
And we have to fight.
I will try to persuade them.
Please show that you are not going to resist.
Since Eren turned into a titan, my head has not stopped thinking.
I didn't have time to think about it, but it doesn't matter.
They will think during the conversation.
Stop!
Finally we see you, monster.
We shoot.
I give the command to shoot.
Eren is not the enemy of humanity.
We are ready to cooperate, ready to tell everything we know.
You want to save your skin.
We know who he is and we have no reason to spare him.
How can you prove that he is not the enemy of humanity?
We must eliminate him for our safety.
Proof is not needed.
They are not needed.
They are too much.
It doesn't matter whether he is a human or a giant.
What?
Many soldiers saw him during the battle.
So they saw how he fought with other giants.
And a crowd of giants who tried to stop him.
We saw that the giants perceived him as an enemy.
They tried to eat him, just like people.
So that they don't talk about him.
But this is the truth and it cannot be denied.
But he is right.
This giant was our ally.
Get ready for battle.
Don't believe him, you perverted logic.
We never understand what the giants think.
He pretended to be a human.
He spoke our language.
He did all this to fool us.
He miscalculated.
He can't fool us.
But not this.
He doesn't want to listen to me.
He doesn't want to think.
Eren, Mikasa.
I swore in the school to protect humanity.
Even for the price of my life.
If I have to die for him now, I'm ready for it.
If we unite, then with the help of Eren's strength
and the rest of the army,
we will be able to take this city from the giants.
I'm doing my best for the sake of the giants.
I swear.
I swear.
I swear.
I'm ready to sacrifice my life for the sake of the giants.
I'm ready to sacrifice my life for the sake of the giants.
I'm ready to sacrifice my life for the sake of the giants.
Commander Herman,
I think we should think about him.
Shut up!
Let them not speak of our enemies.
We must eliminate the enemy because this is the duty of the army!
Calm down. Why do you like to act so much and not like to think so much, Vermin?
Commander-in-Chief!
Look at how strong his oath of faith is.
I can see very well what is going on here.
Form a support unit. And I will listen to what these children want to offer us.
According to the report of the reconnaissance unit, the attack of the giants was expected from the south.
The first blow came from the district of Shiganshina, which was located in the southern part of the wall of the sea.
Therefore, the most likely and the next target was the city of Trost, because it was located in the southern part of the wall of the rose.
The inner gates of Trost.
Dot Pixis. Under his command, there is the garrison of the city of Trost and all the southern territories of the people.
In other words, he is responsible for the defense of all mankind.
Don't look at anyone, you freaks. I wouldn't mind if I was eaten by a beauty-giant.
And the people around consider him an extraordinary person.
What does the commander-in-chief think? Why did he go to talk to them on the wall and not take care of them?
I don't know. Ordinary people don't understand what the commander-in-chief thinks.
Commander, is the garrison formed?
Yes. Good job.
So that's how it is. All the answers are in that basement.
Yes. Do you believe him?
We don't know for sure if there is something there or not, but I will accept it.
But now you have a great chance to prove the sincerity of your intentions. I guarantee your safety.
Did you say your name is Armin Arlert?
Yes.
You recently said that using the power of Eren, the power of giants, we will be able to free the city.
Do you really think so? Or did you just want to save your life?
In fact, both.
That's what I thought at that moment.
By becoming a titan, Eren can move that giant stone and shut the gates of the city.
I didn't have time to think about everything in detail.
I thought that the monstrous power of Eren would help us find a way out of the situation.
And of course, I wanted to save our lives.
To save our lives. I believe in that unconditionally.
Well, Jäger.
Yes?
Can you shut the hole in the wall?
Actually, I don't know.
It's hard for me to say. I know my transformation into a giant is no more than each of you.
So I can't know if I can shut the wall or not. And I can't make a promise.
Here it is. I'm sorry. I put the wrong question.
Will you do it or not?
It's up to you.
I don't have to.
I'll do it.
I don't have to.
I don't know if I can shut the hole.
But I'll do everything I can.
