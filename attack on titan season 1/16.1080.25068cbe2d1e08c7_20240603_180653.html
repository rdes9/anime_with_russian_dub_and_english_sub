        <pre>YES!
Attack time!
Night before the attack, the right choice.
When did you replace the main unit?
Six days ago, right after the cleaning.
It matches the magazine.
Okay, next.
42nd unit, Crystal Lens.
Check the equipment.
Think about it, they're punishing the titans for killing them.
They were needed for experiments after all.
It doesn't matter.
Are they looking for criminals among the cadets?
Yeah.
We cleaned the bodies all day today.
The garlic is falling.
I guess someone really hated the titans.
Yeah, but in the end, he just picked them up.
He satisfied his thirst for revenge because of the success of the entire humanity.
I can understand him.
I'm good at stupid things.
Before I saw the titans, I really wanted to become an agent.
But now...
Whatever, I just don't want to see them anymore.
And today we need to decide who to become.
Even Jeanne gave up.
Everyone is already sad.
I wish I knew what kind of nightmare awaits me.
I wouldn't have gone to serve for anything.
I have no strength left to think about anything else.
Oh, Marco.
I don't even know what kind of bones are yours here.
I wouldn't have become a warrior.
I wouldn't have thought that I would be the next to feel on these fires.
Do you want to give up everything you learned in the bloody battle and recognize yourself as a humble Jedi?
I know.
We need to continue the struggle.
But not everyone is ready to bravely go to death like you.
I hope you're not angry.
But you're not very strong.
That's why you understand how weak he is.
In addition, you quickly grasp the situation.
You immediately realized what to do.
I realized what to do.
Hey, listen.
Have you already decided who will go where?
I decided.
I...
I...
I...
I'm going to the scout.
Damn it!
Oh, no.
What do you think?
Even Jean said he was going to the scout.
Jean?
Well, let it be.
You will serve in the guard.
Maybe I should even...
And if I step into the abyss, will you step too?
What nonsense?
No, of course.
Then why don't you decide for yourself?
Armin, what about you?
I think there are cases when you have to die for something.
Even if you don't want to.
I see.
So you made the choice.
Yes, I've been thinking about it for a long time.
Really?
Armin, you too?
You're weak, but you're strong.
Well, thank you.
Annie, you're very kind.
Huh?
Maybe you want to talk us into going to the scout.
And you have a special reason to serve in the guard.
I don't think so.
I just don't want to die.
It seems that no one among the soldiers used the maneuvering gun without permission.
But who was it then?
No idea.
Now I'm more concerned about the upcoming reception of the scout.
I wonder how many madmen there will be ready to join our detachment.
Say, Eren.
Of those you studied with, are there any who will come to us?
Yes, there are.
Rather, there were.
I don't know right now.
Attention!
Get ready, we're going to the scout.
Yes, sir!
Good morning, Captain Levi!
Eren, remember, keep your distance from me, not farther than on two horses.
I mean, you're not in the chains now, only because I can keep an eye on you.
Yes, sir!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Jean!
Are you really going to the scout?
Yes.
But why, all of a sudden?
Aren't you afraid?
What do you think?
Of course I don't want to go there.
Then why?
As much as I was afraid of the Titans, I'm afraid.
I'm not going to argue about the fact that the scouts are the best of the best.
My life is dear to me, unlike anyone else.
Are you talking about Eren?
He's already become one of the scouts.
Cursants!
Listen here!
Get ready for the scouts!
Get ready for the scouts!
I'm ready to risk my life not because someone convinced me.
You have to decide for yourself, otherwise you won't make it.
My name is Irving Smith.
I'm in charge of the scout service.
Today you will choose which troops you will go to.
I'm here to convince you to come to us.
You have already survived the attack of the Titans and you know how scary they can be and how limited your strength is.
But this battle brought us closer to victory than all the previous ones thanks to Eren Yager.
He is our defender and has solved all our doubts in him, risking his life in battle.
With his help, we not only stopped the attack of the Titans, but also found the key to solving their true nature.
As we believe, in the basement of his house in Shiganshin, there will be answers that we are looking for and that he himself does not have.
If we manage to get to the basement, we will find a way to kill the ancient rulers of the Titans once and for all.
In the basement?
Have we already progressed so much? If we find out where they came from, we will be able to defeat them.
Even if the newcomers really need to disclose such information, it's madness.
Or does he have a hidden motive?
I don't understand. It's as if he wants to see something.
After three years of training, there is a ceremony where the cadets choose between the garrison, the intelligence service or the guard.
Only a dozen of the best can get to the guard, so the choice is actually between the intelligence service or the garrison.
We are heading to the basement of the house in Shiganshin. However, in order to do this, we need to beat the enemy off the wall of Mary, that is, our main goal has not changed.
The exit to Strost is now closed. Therefore, we will have to go to the entrance from Korones to the east.
For four years we tried to pave the way for the large army, but it was unsuccessful.
In these four years, we have lost more than three-fifths of the staff.
60% in four years. This is a terrible figure.
Those of you who will join us will participate in the exit behind the walls in a month.
As we expect, the third of them will not return, and in four years most of them will die.
But those who survive will become first-class fighters capable of much.
Now, when you know the truth without mercy, who else wants to risk their lives, stay here.
Ask yourself, are you ready if you have to put your living heart on the altar of victory?
I have everything. Who chooses other troops can go.
Commander, you scared them too much. They will all leave now.
Damn it! Where are you going? You have already decided.
Don't make me hate myself even more.
If I leave, all the horrors will repeat.
I left my native village to join the guard.
My mother would be proud of me if I became a guard. The whole village respects me.
We already know. We saw.
What about the Titans?
They eat people.
Are you ready to die if you are ordered to?
I don't want to die!
All right. I like your faces.
So, I am happy to announce you to the soldiers of the intelligence service.
Now this is your military greeting. Be ready to give your hearts.
Guys.
It's terrible. Where did I get?
I'm scared. I want to go home.
I don't care anymore.
If you want to cry, you'd better go.
You can't go.
You can't go.
You can't go.
If you want to cry, you'd better go.
You managed to defeat the fear of death. You are all brave fighters.
I'm glad to see you in our ranks.
My name is Ness.
And this is my horse, Charlotte.
She likes to chew hair, so be careful.
Welcome.
Hey, Charlotte, stop it!
Someone, take her away from me!
The next day we were trained.
Instead of training, we were mainly reminded of the formation of the army for long-range reconnaissance, invented by the commander Irwin.
Although it was drawn in the smallest details, it had nowhere to indicate a place for Eren Yeager.
You newcomers will be here, between the escort of the cargo ships and the support of the right flank.
Your task is to prepare the vests and convey the message.
The elite squad will be here, ready.
In the middle of the last row.
The blue-skinned hid us.
This is a safe place in the ranks.
It is even better protected than a cart with supplies.
And our goal is just a short run.
This is a rehearsal of your trip to Shiganshina.
So we won't be late for a long time.
Actually, I still don't know how to apply my strength.
Did you understand what the commander's question meant?
Who do you think is our enemy?
Did you all understand?
No.
It would be wrong to say that I understood him for sure.
But I think ...
Perhaps the goal of our trip is actually different.
But the commander decided that it was better not to announce it to the fighters.
We will focus on what is required from us.
There and back.
Believe in the commander.
Okay.
That's all for today.
Get ready to come back.
It's them!
Hello!
Can I talk to the scouts?
What's the matter?
Run!
Hey, Mikasa!
Armin!
Eren!
I haven't seen you for a hundred years!
Eren!
What are they doing there with you?
Are they exploring your abilities?
Are they teasing you? Are they torturing you?
What?
What do you mean?
That brat has gone too far.
Someday he will pay for everything.
I hope it's not about the captain.
Hi, Eren!
Long time no see!
Are you all here?
Wait, are you here?
Don't tell me you're all in the scouts.
Why else would we be here?
So only Jean, Annie and Marco went to the guard?
No way!
You too?
Marco is dead.
What did you say?
I didn't hear you.
Marco is dead?
Not everyone has to die a hero's death.
I don't even know how he died.
Nobody saw it and nobody helped him.
Marco...
Hey, newcomers!
Come here!
Your uniform is ready!
THE END
Umar...
So you are...
Really?
Yes.
We are also taking part in the mission.
Listen, Eren.
I heard you waved at Mikasa when you turned into a titan.
What does that mean?
No.
He wanted to knock down the fly.
I didn't ask you.
By the way, you have a big scar on your cheek.
Where did you get so hurt?
It seems to be true.
I also heard that you tried to kill Mikasa.
What does that mean?
Don't you remember?
So you didn't even realize that you turned into a titan and couldn't control your new powers?
Yes.
That's right.
Did you hear that?
That's how it is.
And he is the hope of all humanity.
I won't be surprised if we all die, like Marco.
He won't even understand it.
What's the point of interrogating Eren now?
You know, Mikasa...
Not everyone is like you and ready to die for Eren just like that.
If we are going to die, we want to know what for.
Otherwise, in the last minute, we can be afraid.
We want to see something in return.
Do you understand what I mean?
Let him show what he can offer.
And is it worth it to die?
Do you understand, Eren?
I hope for you.
I really hope.
Yes.
Commander, everything is ready.
We have dispatched the titans nearby.
30 seconds before turning.
They are scouts!
And their drawing on their backs is called the wings of freedom.
How beautiful!
It's time!
Humanity is one step ahead!
Show us what you are capable of!
Open the gates!
Forward!
We are starting the 57th wall climb!

It was an investigation team that deployed long-range scouts and proceeded to the walls.
Suddenly, a mysterious giant appeared in front of them.
