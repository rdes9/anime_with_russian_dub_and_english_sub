        <pre>Let's start the 57th walk through the walls! Follow me!
The scouts went through the walls, trying to get to Shiganshina.
But they ran into a man in the form of a titan, like Eren.
It's not a runaway! It's a man in the form of a titan!
Losing one fighter after another, they turned into a forest of giant trees.
But why? No one knew.
If our squad can't beat it, then who?
Choose. Either believe in yourself, or trust me and the rest of the scouts.
I'm with you!
Attack!
Oh yeah, and one more question.
Do you mind if we cut off your arms and legs? They'll still grow back.
I'm talking about your real human arms and legs.
After all, we need you alive.
The enemy was ready to sacrifice everyone.
I didn't expect it to give itself to the titans to destroy the evidence.
Retreat!
Back in formation!
Retreat!
Retreat!
Back in formation!
Retreat!
Erwin, why did you tell them to refuel? Time is running out.
The woman was eaten by the titans.
But I didn't see if the one inside was eaten or not. And you?
Do you want to say something?
Yes. If your assumption is correct, and I return the human form,
then she kept her mobility and hid the charged drive,
then now she's somewhere here, in our uniform.
Captain Levi?
No, not him.
Who are you?
Gjöldar!
The enemy disguised himself as one of ours.
Gjöldar!
Gjöldar!
Attack of the titans!
Episode 57. The Collapse
When the titan colossus disappeared,
the one who was inside could have the charged drive
and then unnoticeably hide in the cloud of steam.
Could it be the same case here?
I don't even know.
Judging by the fact that Eren left the body of the titan,
it's hardly possible.
His equipment was of no use.
The uniform broke into pieces.
And then he was so weak that he couldn't even stand on his own feet.
The woman of the titans was able to attract other titans with her eagle.
We didn't foresee this, so the operation failed.
If the titans can be improved,
we shouldn't have made all the bets on such an inexperienced fighter as Eren.
In order to trick the enemy, you need to think more flexibly.
Since we're leaving the forest, the task is completed.
Then the rest may already know who is hiding inside the woman of the titans.
I'd like to see it.
But why?
We believe that it's better for Eren to get out of the wall than for the enemy to follow him.
Probably because they unexpectedly stopped the attack last time.
They managed to break through through the outer gates into the cable.
But they didn't touch the inner gates.
And they didn't stop Eren when he closed the gap.
Perhaps they had more serious concerns.
What are they?
Something was more important to them than the invasion.
Something they didn't expect.
The transformation of Eren into a titan?
I don't think there's anything else.
That means...
Then?
One of the fighters who was there and saw how Eren transformed into a titan.
Gunter!
Why are you frozen?
Go!
What about Gunter?
Who's there?
Protect Eren!
Damn, what's next?
Ed, where do we go now?
We don't have time to get to the horses.
Let's get to the headquarters.
Was that the titan or are there more spies?
Damn you!
How dare you!
Just shut up, I'm going to lay down dead!
A titan woman?
That can't be!
How?
We caught her!
If the enemy has somehow preserved its power,
then it will be able to be reborn again.
I knew it!
It's her again!
The titan woman is coming!
Damn!
The headquarters failed!
I'm going to lay her down now!
No!
The three of us will take care of her.
You move to the headquarters as soon as possible.
This battle taught us a lesson.
If you are too careful, the enemy will always be ahead.
You need to be ready to put everything on the map
and lose everything, if you're not lucky.
I'm going to fight too!
No!
That's the best!
Your strength is dangerous!
What?
Are you doubting us again?
Are you doubting us?
What are you, Eren?
Have you already lost faith in us?
Either we start fighting differently,
or humanity is doomed.
I believe that my squad will win!
Good luck!
No!
We blinded her.
We have a few more minutes.
We'll kill her quickly.
Kill her!
Let her die in disgrace!
You'll pay first!
We must act until her eyes are healed.
We'll scratch her muscles around her shoulders, and she won't be able to close her arms.
Cut her!
Hands!
Let's go!
Ready!
Now the neck!
Cut her neck muscles!
She'll bend her head!
And open that horrible place!
That's the power!
That's the power!
They've driven her into a blind defense!
How can they decide without a word which of them will go where?
Maybe they trust each other too much?
They've been through a lot together.
That's why, even after losing Gunter, they're still very strong!
I'll go forward!
I believe in them!
I won't turn back!
That's the right choice!
Now I know it!
I don't know what's better.
You can't know that.
You can trust your strength.
Or the choice of whom you trust.
But no one knows what will be right.
Cut her neck!
Elf!
How did this happen?
She can't see!
And it's been half a minute!
One eye?
She focused the healing on one eye?
How is that possible?
Petra!
We need to regroup!
Petra!
Faster!
Hey, you!
Die!
How?
Why isn't she taking the sword?
Petra!
This is it!
This is it!
Obya!
Eren!
Mikasa!
Hey, what's wrong?
Mikasa!
What's going on, Zarev?
For the scouts, a special breed of horses was introduced.
A little over one and a half meters in height,
and a little over one and a half meters in height,
and a little over one and a half meters in height,
and a little over one and a half meters in height,
and a little over one and a half meters in height,
and a little over one and a half meters in height,
and about 500 kilograms in weight.
These horses are capable of top speed up to 80 km per hour.
They are practically the only means of ending a titan.

Give me back my sword!
Give it back!
Why? The sword doesn't take it!
I know! He's alive!
I know for sure! Eren is alive!
Wherever she goes, I'll kill her!
I'll evaporate and get you out of there!
I promise you!
I'm sorry, Eren. Just be patient!
Just a little more!
Wait!
Stop!
Hold on while you can.
Keep the distance.
Looks like she's tired.
She's not running that fast either.
Looks like she bit him straight out of his neck.
Do you think he's still alive?
