        <pre>More than 100 years ago, people faced invisible enemies.
The difference in power between them and humanity was too great.
Humanity was on the verge of extinction.
For protection, the survivors built three huge walls, a sea, a rose and a tire.
They lived in peace for hundreds of years.
However, in 845, when the Titan Colossus and the armored Titan, which emerged from nowhere, broke the wall, our life was completely destroyed.
People left the wall of Mary and retreated behind the wall of the Rose, losing the fifth part of the population and the third part of their land.
And so, in 850, the Titan Colossus appeared again and broke another wall.
And so, in 850, the Titan Colossus appeared again and broke another wall, opening the passage for the Titans.
Aaron! Hurry up!
In two hours, all the inhabitants of the city managed to escape.
No one became the prey of the Titans, except those fighters who went to detain them.
Aaron, as long as you are here, I can do anything.
Attack of the Titans
Attack of the Titans
Attack of the Titans
Attack of the Titans
The Battle for Throst, The Short Blade
The Battle for Throst, The Short Blade
Wait, Commander!
If the Titans attack here, our squad won't be able to get away from them alone!
Please, stay with us!
Don't interfere!
I must prepare reinforcements!
Security at the inner gates?
What kind of hints are these?
This is the plan of action!
We soldiers will obey the plan!
This is our military duty!
But what if they capture this warehouse?
Shut up!
One more word, and I'll execute you on the spot as traitors!
Let's go!
I heard they announced a temporary retreat.
Why isn't anyone climbing up the walls?
That's it!
We're done for!
We're done for!
I'm ready!
And how will this help us?
Jean, what do we do now?
What can we do?
We gave the order to retreat.
But we don't have enough gas to climb up the walls.
We're all dead.
It's all because of these cowards.
Because of the supply squad?
What's wrong with them? Did they get hit?
They're too scared.
And they won't come out.
Fear can be understood.
But leaving us without gas and hiding in the headquarters?
It doesn't fit in my head.
The titans must have surrounded them and we won't be refueled.
Anyway, we have to try to clear the area around the headquarters.
We won't be worse than here.
The titans will soon come here.
And we will only run away with the rest of the gas and waste it.
And without the supplies, we will definitely not survive.
Come on, Kony, you started to think with your head.
For centuries.
And what do you think we can do?
Almost all experienced fighters from the avant-garde are killed.
And who of us beginners will lead the rest to such a danger?
If we find someone, we won't win.
The warehouse of gas has probably already been refueled.
The warehouse of gas has probably already been refueled.
Four-meter titans.
So refueling won't work.
We are doomed.
I have a boring life.
I would have known right away that it would turn out like this.
Come on, guys.
Come on, get up.
Don't be afraid.
Together we can do it.
I will command.
Armin, come with us.
Rainer, what do you suggest?
It won't work.
If we go, then all together.
It's useless.
We can't get out of the city alive.
I knew I was going to die.
But why am I dying?
But why?
Mikasa, you were in the rearguard.
Annie.
I saw a general picture.
By the way, I'm sorry I'm personal, but...
Where is Eren's squad?
I didn't see them.
No one got to the wall.
So here's Armin sitting.
Armin.
Mikasa.
No.
How can I look her in the eye?
I survived because I was scared.
It would be better if I died.
Together with him.
Armin, aren't you hurt?
Are you all right?
Where is Eren?
Armin.
We...
The fighters of the 34th training squad.
Thomas Wagner.
Noctis.
Meleos Izaramuski.
Mina Karolina.
Eren Yeager.
All five did their duty.
They fell to the death of the brave in the fight against the enemy.
God.
So there's almost no one left of the 34th?
Let's go against the titans and it will be the same with us.
I'm sorry, Mikasa.
Eren gave up his life for me.
And I...
And I couldn't move my finger.
I'm sorry.
Armin.
Calm down.
Now is not the time to give will to feelings.
Come on, get up.
Marco.
If we destroy the titans around the headquarters, we can refuel and climb the walls.
Right?
Right.
But even with you, we are too few.
I can.
I'm strong.
Stronger than you.
Much stronger.
And I have enough strength to defeat the titans.
Even without your help.
I can.
I can do it without you.
Not only are you weak,
you are a cowardly coward.
You disappointed me.
You can stay here.
Wait.
Look, Mikasa, what nonsense are you talking about?
Do you want to fight the titans alone?
You can't handle it.
I can't handle it, I'll die.
But victory means life.
If you don't fight, you don't win.
Wait!
What disappoints me are your words.
I have nothing to say.
It's all your fault, Eren.
Did you teach us to throw our comrades?
Do you really want to die as cowards?
No.
Come on, cowards, weaklings, fools.
Damn it.
I'm with you, too.
Hurry up!
Everyone, follow Mikasa!
We have to hurry.
Watch the gas so that it reaches the headquarters.
Mikasa is flying like a hurricane.
How does she get out?
Oh no, she's going to waste too much gas.
It's going to end soon.
Even a first-grader fighter is helpless without a maneuvering drive.
This is not normal calm.
She will break into the fight to silence the shock.
The balloon won't last long.
Mikasa!
Damn it.
Jean, now you're in charge, and I'll help the army.
I'm with you.
Don't give up.
Who will fight the Titans?
We need a clever fighter.
Episode 5
Again.
Again the same thing.
Again I'm left without a family.
Again.
I have to start all over again.
I have to live with a new pain in my heart.
The main maneuvering drive has a wired cable.
It has two independent rotation axes.
The control system is strictly classified by the manufacturer.
The balloon contains compressed gas.
Damn it.
We won't even get close.
Or there will be victims again.
Damn it, he ran out of gas.
Don't come any closer.
Tom, I'll pull you out.
Wait, it's too late.
Don't you dare.
Why didn't I stop them?
Why didn't I hold them back?
They could have stayed alive.
They could have.
Did I take responsibility for others?
No.
No, don't.
No.
I don't want to die.
This world is cruel.
And yet,
there is beauty in it.
There is beauty in it.
And it was a good life.
What's going on?
I've already given up.
Why?
I'm getting up again.
Why am I resisting?
Why am I resisting?
Why am I resisting?
Why am I resisting?
What for?
What's the point?
I have nothing more to live for.
What drives me?
Fight!
Fight!
Fight!
Fight!
Eren!
Fight!
Come on! Fight!
Fight!
Fight!
I'm sorry, Eren.
I won't give up.
Never again.
When I die,
I won't even be able to remember you.
So, no matter what happens,
I will fight and I will live on.
What's going on?
One Titan
kills
another Titan?
For the sake of Mikasa,
don't die.
Mikasa!
Mikasa, are you hurt?
Are you okay?
Yes.
We have to hurry.
Damn it!
Two 15-meter ones!
Wait!
One of them!
Eren!
Is that him?
Did he finish?
Does he know where to hit?
It doesn't matter.
Let's go until he switches to us.
No, it looks like we don't care about him.
He would have attacked us already.
He also has the skills of a hoodlum.
Who is he?
Probably another begon.
What do we know about them?
Now the main thing is to get to the headquarters.
Wait!
Mikasa's gas is out!
Are you kidding me?
What are we going to do without you?
There is one option.
I don't have enough gas either.
But still, take my cylinder.
Armin!
There is no other way.
You will benefit more from it than me.
But don't waste it anymore.
Save the others.
I led everyone into battle and didn't even try to protect them.
And then I decided to die.
Without feeling responsible for them at all.
And all because of my egoism.
What kind of me am I?
Yusfak!
Let the rod work!
I will give you all my blades.
Just leave me this short one.
I don't want to be eaten alive.
Why?
Armin!
I won't leave you here.
At that moment...
I was confused.
I never heard that one titan was killing another.
And it seemed to me as if he was celebrating.
As if he was...
As if he was...
A shadow embodied in the anger of the entire humanity.
