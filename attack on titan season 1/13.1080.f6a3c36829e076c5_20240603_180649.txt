Attention!
Now I will explain to you the details of the operation to free Trost.
Allow me to introduce you to this young soldier, still a cadet of Eren Yeager.
Thanks to our secret research, he can turn into a giant at will.
He will transform into a titan, raise a huge balloon near the destroyed gates,
move it to the gates and block their passage.
While he is carrying the balloon, your task is to protect him from other titans.
If we manage to do it, humanity will for the first time win back the territory given to the giants.
We will drive them out of our land.
Compared to the fact that the giants took away humanity for all this time, this victory will seem insignificant.
Well, let it be.
This small step will be the first step of humanity to victory over the giants.
Eren, do you recognize me?
I am Mikasa.
I am your family.
Family!
Akerman, stop it!
He is not our ally.
He is an ordinary stupid giant.
We continue the operation.
We must protect Yeager and bring him back to the base.
He is very valuable to humanity.
We cannot leave him here.
Unlike us, he has unique skills.
Where am I?
Am I at home?
Jean!
Why doesn't he use his gun?
No way!
His gun is broken!
It's okay, we'll break through!
Mikasa!
What about the operation?
We failed.
We cannot abandon Eren and fight the giants.
But there are too many of them.
If it goes on like this, they will kill us all.
The area behind us is 6 meters by 10 centimeters.
Eren!
Answer me!
Now, behind the walls of the city, the real hell is spreading.
Why do you need the outer world so much?
Why?
Because I was born in this world!
Eren!
Attack of the Titans
Attack of the Titans
Attack of the Titans
Attack of the Titans
Battle for Throst. The original instinct.
Damn it!
Why am I pulling everyone back?
Am I really not capable of anything?
Am I really not capable of anything?
Commander, we're lost!
There's no one left!
Back to the Moon!
Report!
Five Titans outside the gate!
What am I going to do?
I'm going to sit here and wait until the Titans come for a walk and leave?
Jean, she's got a broken drive.
What's going on?
Damn it!
What's going on?
What's going on?
What's going on right now?
Jean, calm down!
Marco?
What are you thinking?
Well, we've got nothing to do.
Well, we've got nothing to do.
Damn it, why aren't you pressing the button?
Jean!
What happened to you?
Who told you to do that?
Get out of here already!
Are you crazy?
Are you crazy?
I can't believe I'm still alive!
Look!
Eren!
Mikasa!
Armin!
Eren came to his senses!
He's trying to complete the mission!
Or else...
Or else...
Or else...
Or else...
Or else...
Or else...
Or else...
Or else...
Or else...
No!
If we cover him while he's going to the gates,
it's our victory!
Did you hear that?
If we have to, we'll all get down,
but we'll protect him!
We won't let any titans get close to him!
We'll detain them!
We have to support Eren!
You two, run to Eren!
This is an order!
Do you understand?
Yes, sir!
Metabee!
Why are they there?
The titans can't see us!
We have to get closer to them!
Come here, everyone!
Or else I'll break you all into pieces!
I'll break you all into pieces!
I'll break you all into pieces!
I'll break you all into pieces!
I'll break you all into pieces!
I'll break you all into pieces!
They're coming!
Two of them are coming!
Run!
Go back to the house!
God!
Staying on the street to commit suicide!
Without horses and without cover,
they're helpless!
No!
Only this remains now!
Follow them!
Armin!
Let's go!
This way!
This way!
I feel like...
I feel like...
Mikasa!
Armin!
What are you doing down there?
There was an easy prey for the titans!
Hey, Chiripaki!
Come here!
Come on, catch me!
Hey!
Metabee!
Why do you need the lower world so much?
We all...
When we were born...
We all...
Were born free...
And it doesn't matter how strong
The ones who want to take our freedom are!
The ones who want to take our freedom are!
Fire water...
ice land...
anything else!
The one who sees it all
will be the freest in the world!
will be the freest in the world!
We have to fight for freedom, and it's not a pity to die.
The world can be scary, it doesn't matter.
The world can be cruel, it doesn't matter.
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
Another titan!
Take him on yourself!
Get out of the way!
Go!
Go, Eren!
Fight!
Guys, you didn't die in vain.
Today, people have won over the titans for the first time.
Yellow smoke signal! The mission has been successfully accomplished!
Send more people! Take the elite squad away from there!
According to the earliest record, the titans appeared 107 years ago and destroyed most of the people on Earth.
People tried to fight back with cannons, but the wounded titans were quickly healed.
The rest of the titans are approaching!
Let's jump onto the walls!
We have to take Eren first!
Armin, how's Eren?
I didn't even think he could get so angry! We have to get onto the walls as soon as possible!
He's fighting the titans in some places! I can't get him out!
We have to cut him!
Wait!
Eren!
Eren! Armin!
Mikasa!
Mikasa!
That's an emblem!
Eren!
Freedom!
So, guys, what's going on here? Will anyone tell us?
Thanks to the sudden arrival of the scouts and the efforts of the garrison engineers, the wall of the Rose has again survived the attack of the titans.
It took a whole day of continuous cannon fire from above to clear the rope from those titans who were trapped in its walls.
Explosive shells destroyed most of the titans who stormed the walls. A group of scouts finished off those few who survived.
During the mission, the people managed to catch the lives of one four-meter-titan and one seven-meter-titan.
However, there were 207 people killed and missing, and another 897 were wounded.
The people actually won the first victory over the titans, but it was too expensive to celebrate it.
Eren!
Oh, hey!
That's Marko!
Do you know him? Can you tell us what his name was?
I also noticed that he disappeared somewhere.
But I don't believe my eyes.
Marko, how come?
Has anyone seen how he died?
What was his name?
If you know, tell us.
Do you hear me, cadet?
It's been two days since the hole was made, and we still haven't gathered all the bodies.
The epidemic can spread like this.
We can't let another tragedy happen.
That's the main thing.
There's no time to insult your comrade now.
What time is it?
Unit 104, commander of the 19th group, Marko Bot.
Marko, it's good that we know his name.
Well, let's continue.
What is it?
What a horror!
What is it?
The titans broke out.
Their food is not digested.
How will they fill their stomachs?
Oh, my God!
Well, how can you identify someone here?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
What's the point in apologizing?
We're not here to fight.
Do you want to ask something?
This is Irvin, the commander of the strike group of scouts.
And Captain Levi.
Where am I?
Where am I?
Where am I?
Where am I?
Where am I?
Where am I?
Where am I?
Tell me.
Where am I?
It's easy to guess.
In the dungeon.
In the solitary cell.
The guard took you as a guard and didn't let us see you for a long time.
The key?
Yes, we found it in your things.
Then we'll give it back to you.
It seems that in the basement of your house, your father kept the answer to the question of where the titans came from.
Right?
Yes, probably.
You don't remember anything?
My father doesn't know.
It's a convenient position. What can I say?
We've already come to the conclusion that he doesn't need to lie.
And we still don't know much.
Now you have to answer us what you are going to do.
What am I going to do?
Before we get to your house, we need to break the wall of the shiganshina.
The most simple thing will be to close the destroyed gates with the help of your powers in the form of a titan.
The irony is that our salvation depends on the titan.
Titan of the Colossus and the armored titan are essentially the same as you.
Your decision.
Here is the key, the key that will save humanity from despair.
Oleg, so it's me?
I will destroy them all.
All to the last one.
And I won't leave a single one of them.
Hey, answer the destruction already.
What do you want?
I want to enter the reconnaissance and kill them all.
All of them.
Not bad.
Erwin, I will take him under my care.
So give the command.
Not because I trust him.
If he betrays us, I will kill him on the spot.
No one can do this except me, so it is unlikely that someone will object.
Your wish is accepted.
To be your scout.
The continuation follows.
To be continued.
To be continued.
To be continued.
