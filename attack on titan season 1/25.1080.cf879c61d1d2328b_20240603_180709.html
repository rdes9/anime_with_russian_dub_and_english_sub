        <pre>We have no choice. This world is very cruel.
I will drive you all away!
No! I will destroy you!
On that day, humanity remembered.
About the fears that control them.
About the fears that drove them into a cage.
And about their disgrace.
No!

Attack of the Titans.
Battle of Stahes, the wall.
Let us pray, Maria Rosashina.
Let us pray to our goddesses.
Let them protect us.
We must believe in the power of the sacred walls.
They are created by the command of our Lord.
And only our faith in the power of the sacred walls will make them stronger.
Because the believing heart without a shadow of doubt is the best protection against the giants.
This is the only force that can drive...
The giant in our city!
Not this!
Don't come any closer to the wall!
Stop!
It seems that this time he has saved his consciousness.
Yes.
However, he has never managed to defeat her.
He has not only become a giant, but he is also ready to fight against Anya.
He will defeat her.
In a fight alone, the desire to fight is not enough.
You know it yourself.
It will be very difficult to defeat Anya.
There is a square.
She is running to the square.
We will not be able to use our weapons there.
Move her away from both sides.
Yes.
Hurry up!
Where did the giant come from?
Anya...
I remember you well.
You have always kept the people around you as fools.
And you have always missed them.
You were active only in one case.
When you could see the future.
You were in love with her.
You were in love with her.
You were in love with her.
But, when you could use your martial arts.
Although you told them that it had no sense.
But I knew that actually you do not think so.
I have always considered you an honest person.
And I saw that you can not lie.
Anya, tell us...
What are you fighting for with your own friends?
For what great purpose did you kill all those people?
Wow!
Wow!
Commander, even if we capture the Titan, the city will remain in ruins!
But we will still carry out the operation!
This is Irwin's decision!
Prepare the net!
Yes!
Eren!
We were not warned about this!
Why are giants fighting here?
What's going on?
Giants are fighting each other?
Yes! They are just destroying our city!
There are a lot of casualties.
Military and civilian.
Irwin!
Is this all the result of your plan?
Yes.
I am responsible for what happened.
And I am not going to justify myself.
You should have known that if you carry out such an operation,
there will be a lot of casualties in the city!
How could you allow this to happen?
I did it for the sake of the victory of humanity!
I don't want to hear it!
You are a traitor!
If I execute you right now,
I won't even have any questions!
You can kill me, but then take command of yourself.
We must capture the Titan woman.
Pierre is responsible for the troops.
Bayer is responsible for the supply.
We must contact them and organize.
Wait!
Wait!
Do you really think this is for the sake of humanity?
This is a step towards our victory!
Drop your weapons!
Lock him up in handcuffs!
Yes!
All to the battlefield!
The main task is to ensure the evacuation of the residents!
Yes!
Erwin, you will face a fair trial!
With pleasure, as soon as everything is over.
Levi, don't interfere.
You don't like stupid deaths, do you?
I don't like them, but I see them very often.
The one who is not ready to sacrifice anything
will not be able to change anything.
If you want to defeat the monster,
I am ready to give up humanity.
I am sure that Annie can sacrifice.
Annie!
Annie!
Annie!
Annie!
Annie!
Remember your father, your only ally.
I will destroy all giants.
And all to the last!
Eren!
Eren!
What's wrong with him?
Eren, wait!
Maybe now he won't be able to recognize you.
Oh my God!
Eren!
She clings to the wall!
She's out!
She can run away!
You won't get away!
Eren!
Eren!
Eren!
Eren!
Eren!
Annie!
Fall!
Annie!
I was wrong.
But I don't ask you to forgive me.
I have a request for you.
Let you have to fight against the whole world.
I destroyed everything!
I destroyed everything in this world!
Let even the whole world hate you.
I am your only ally.
Remember that!
But not that!
He wants to eat her!
Stop it, Eren!
Eren!
Now I am free.
Just promise me that you will come back.
I can do it.
Dustâ€¦
What?
They're becoming rich!
Don't you dare to eat our witness, you fool!
I don't know what to do with you.
One landmine decided to make a dig under the wall.
He dug and dug, but the wall didn't end.
He broke his paw and then disappeared.
One year later
Eren
Mikasa
Anya
What's wrong with Anya?
Damn it!
Why did we fight?
Anya
Get out and we'll end this once and for all!
It's not fair!
Anya! Anya!
Enough!
You can't break it.
Connect the network from the wires.
We'll drag her underground.
Yes, sir!
If we can't drag her out, we won't be able to interrogate her.
But what then?
We lost so many soldiers,
and she hid and left us only riddles.
What did we fight for?
Let's go!
This operation can't be called successful.
It can.
They'll hang me, most likely.
But our detachment won't disband.
I hope so.
Irwin
We have questions about your actions.
Why didn't you help the Royal Guard to carry out the operation,
but did everything with your own strength?
There was a chance that the Titan women had allies in the Guard.
We could only use those who were completely sure.
Because of you, Stahes lies in ruins.
Why did it happen?
Because we were too weak.
I'm very sorry.
He still dares to apologize!
If we hadn't grabbed her, she would have destroyed the wall.
Our losses would have been much greater.
I see.
Tell me, we all paid a great price.
Can we be sure that humanity doesn't threaten anything?
Yes, sir.
I don't think you can get any information from Annie Leinhardt.
Yes, it's impossible.
So, all these victims were in vain.
Eren
Eren
Eren
How do you feel?
I feel so good.
They say Annie is still in crystal.
Damn it!
We did so much, and in the end we didn't get anything.
Annie sacrificed everything to protect the information from us.
Yes.
She ran into her crystal.
Eren let her go.
I'm right, Eren.
If you didn't wait,
you wouldn't have been able to do anything.
If you didn't wait...
Yes.
Armin is right.
I was scared.
When I saw her,
I couldn't move.
Armin Arlert,
Jean Kirschtein.
You're being questioned.
They started with us.
We'll be back soon.
Yes.
Armin Arlert
At that moment,
I felt a surge of power.
It seemed that my body was capable of everything.
I felt so good
that I was ready to die.
Eren
Eren
I don't think so now.
I'm so happy
that you're back.
I don't understand.
Do we really have to turn into monsters
in order to fight giants?
Can't we defeat them any other way?
This is one of the possible methods of fighting them.
But Eren will succeed.
Armin
If he turns into a monster
and destroys all giants,
can we call it the victory of mankind?
Eren
Eat.
It's hard to overcome our wall.
However,
I believe that thanks to this victory,
the chances of mankind will increase.
We didn't know before
that people could turn into giants.
And now we've captured one of them,
and that's a big achievement.
There must be other people, giants.
We have to neutralize them all.
We have to capture them.
Or destroy them.
It's time to strike back.
All suspicions were removed
from the scouts of the reconnaissance unit
from Eren Yeager.
The surveillance of Anni Leinhardt,
who was deep underground,
was also entrusted to the reconnaissance unit.
But our knowledge
was an illusion.
Mankind had to pay
an even higher price
to learn the truth about giants.
We were like living corpses.
Let's meet again
outside the walls
in a place without maps.
THE END
