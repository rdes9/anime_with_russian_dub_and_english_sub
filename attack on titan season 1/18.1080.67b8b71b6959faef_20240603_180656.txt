We begin the 57th exit behind the wall. Follow me!
As we suppose, in the basement of the house of Aaron Yeager, in Shiganshina, they will find the answers that he himself does not have.
We will go there.
You will be here. Your position is between the escort of the freight trains and the support of the right flank.
Your task is to keep the spare horses ready and convey the message.
The elite detachment will be here, ready in the middle of the back row.
This is the safest place in the line. It is even better protected than the trains with supplies.
What?
They are not running.
She is different.
She has a mind.
Like the armored one, or the Colossus, or Aaron.
Her movements are much more accurate than the others.
Damn, it looks like I underestimated her.
She closed her neck.
Damn, I have nowhere to go.
Jean!
Revenge for the one who broke into the titans for a snack.
She suddenly froze.
It's her. She killed him.
He was on the right flank. He was going to die. Revenge for him!
Well, we've won enough time. Let's run away from her.
Oh, no. Why?
Is she running to Aaron?
What?
What?
What?
What?
What?
What?
What?
What?
What?
What?
What?
What?
What?
What?
What?
What?
Attack of the titans.
The 57th outing among the trees of the giants.
How are you, Armin? How's your drive?
It's okay. The clutch is working. It doesn't seem to be broken.
Yeah, that's good.
But how can we? We have only one horse.
We can't get away together if only Jean's horse doesn't come back.
Damn it!
What kind of attack is this?
The horse is back. Where did my horse go?
We can't stay here.
In the worst case, we'll have to leave someone here.
But how do we decide who to stay?
Armin, because he's wounded?
Or Rainer, because he's heavy and will load the horse heavily?
Or should I stay and try to find my horse?
Damn it! Why do I have to solve such questions?
We all survived this battle.
It's not fair!
Armin!
Armin!
Are you not fully recovered yet?
Yeah, my head is spinning a little.
I see.
But we have to make a choice.
We have to decide who will stay, even though it's not easy.
Wait!
First, let's give a signal.
If the formation continues to move forward, the third group in the fourth row should be nearby.
This is a signal of an emergency situation.
I don't think they'll guess what we want.
Armin, we can wait three minutes.
Then we'll have to decide.
I'll stay.
Just give them a message from me.
Best of all, to Commander Irwin.
Alone.
No, Armin, you'll tell them everything yourself.
No, I can't.
Looks like someone's coming here.
With two horses.
I think it's...
Christ!
Guys, are you okay?
That's my horse!
Come on, get off the horse, Buchwald.
He came to me.
You ran into the titans?
Armin!
You're wounded!
What's wrong with you?
I'm okay.
Did you really notice our signal?
I was nearby.
I already had a horse.
You're even loved by horses.
It looks like they're all alive.
You're our savior.
I'm so glad.
You're our savior.
I'm so glad.
Everything could have ended much worse.
What a relief.
Angel.
Goddess.
Marry me.
We have to get back to the camp.
Yes, they're probably already retreating.
But...
We've been standing behind the wall for hours.
The situation is much more desperate than I thought.
And for some reason she ran in the opposite direction from the avant-garde commanders.
Who is she?
Green signals?
Looks like the formation is moving on.
Just change the direction.
How?
Aren't we retreating?
Erwin, do you have any idea what he's doing?
In fact, any soldier has the right to decide whether he is able to carry out the task or not.
Maybe the commander didn't see our signal.
Maybe he has his own plan.
Whatever it is, we have one thing to do.
Execute the order.
Green signal.
Green.
Hello, shoot!
Got it!
Everything looks safe so far.
But what's the situation really like?
There could be losses in the front lines.
Allow me to report.
I'm sending a message.
The right flank is destroyed.
The formation is partially destroyed.
We need to move to the left.
Did you hear that, Petra?
Go!
Got it!
The right flank?
There are other newcomers in the army.
True, they should be closer to the middle.
I don't think the titans got that far.
I hope they're all right.
Black signals?
Begon?
Erwin, you shoot!
Got it!
We missed the enemy.
The titans are here.
They're very close.
Each of these signals could mean that someone is fighting.
Damn it!
Look here!
Look, monster!
Grenade!
Fire!
Fire!
Fire!
Fire!
Fire!
Fire!
Fire!
Fire!
Fire!
An assault from 3 sides!
Even if you have some media in your mind,
you wouldn't be protected from all of them!
Weapon, my heel,
all that doesn't matter!
Whovaver you find!
And we could stop that!
deeply!
That's for all who got believe!
And you're dying in agony!
Your
Let me go!
We need to warn the others about what she's capable of.
Whatever it is!
A runaway? How did he get here?
Let's kill him!
We can't let him go any further!
The right flank is destroyed, and we're still not retreating!
Why?
I don't know!
Commander's order!
Give the garrison to the left!
What's going on?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
What's going on?
We're still going east!
We were supposed to go south, to the old town.
We're going into the same forest.
Yeah.
I can already see it.
A forest of giant trees.
Trees of huge height, sometimes more than 80 meters,
meet both inside the walls and behind them.
Before the invasion behind the walls of the sea,
this forest was a place of rest for tourists.
Now the scouts use it as a strategic shelter.
It looks like the titans were passing through here.
Nothing grows on the road.
The strips will go inside.
Tell the rear that only the central column should enter the forest.
Yes, sir!
Excuse me, sir.
The central column is entering the forest.
What should we do?
Should we go into the forest?
We'll go around it.
Yes, sir!
So what have we forgotten at this resort?
If we go back, it's the other way around.
Going to the goal is also the other way around.
I don't know.
Either way, this is Commander Irwin's order.
He must have come up with something.
So what?
Are we going to have a party in the nature in honor of our first mission?
No.
I don't think so.
Someone has a bad sense of humor.
If we're serious, the titans are on our tail.
No matter what he thinks, we can't stay here.
Unless we pass through here.
The final point is somewhere else.
Stop, everyone!
So, newcomers, listen here.
We are preparing to strike back.
Wait on the trees with the swords ready.
Don't let the titans into the forest.
Unite!
Excuse me, what exactly?
Don't argue, but act!
He's making fun of us?
What's going on?
Listen.
It seems that only the central column has entered the forest.
What about the formation?
There is no formation anymore.
The forest is on our way.
We will have to bypass the left and right flank.
We can no longer notify others.
Why didn't we turn to the side of the forest?
Irwin, aren't you guided by the map?
I don't know.
Perhaps we deviated from the course too much.
Because we tried to avoid the threat from the right flank.
You can go crazy.
Because of the attack, our task flew to hell.
It turns out that we need to turn around and return home.
But no, for some reason we come here and stand here just in case
if the titans want to turn back into the forest.
Yes.
We should send him with such orders.
Quiet.
He will hear.
And what I especially like is zero explanation.
Of course, he does not have enough other concerns before that.
Why is that?
Because the commander, whom the fighters consider to be a fool,
in a decisive minute, can send the titans to the forest.
What do you mean?
Because the commander, whom the fighters consider to be a fool,
can see a little knife in his back.
To be honest, I would not be surprised.
John, what are you going to do?
Don't be afraid.
I'm just a little on the lead because of all this.
What am I going to do?
Obey the order.
Protect the forest from the titans.
You don't have anything against this, I hope.
You seem to be guessing something.
Well ...
The five-meter-long is approaching!
Why do you have to lead me here, Troy?
I'm waiting for Mameo, Commander Irwin.
No, I don't think so.
Let's say the titan woman is hunting for Eren.
And let's say the commander knows this.
If we allow what we have, we should ...
Captain! Captain Levi!
What do you want?
What do you mean what?
From all sides of the forest.
Our column is here alone, and we will not notice the titans on the way.
The threat from the right flank has not disappeared yet.
If we can't do anything, we will avoid the titans and protect the strip.
Thank you, enlightened, but I didn't know the fool.
Of course we can't.
Then why?
Look around, Eren.
This is called the giant trees.
The perfect location for maneuvering vehicles.
Come on, think about it.
Tension yourself, if you have them.
If you don't want to die, use your brain.
Yes!
I see.
I'm just a newbie, I don't understand tactics.
He won't give me an answer.
I have to think about him.
Apparently, they all studied like that.
What the hell?
Who are they holding us back?
To all of you.
What have we forgotten here?
Could it be?
Could it be?
Where are they?
That is, no one knows why we are here.
And suddenly?
And Levi himself doesn't know.
Eren is following Eren.
If I'm right, there is only one reason to be in the forest.
Eren intends to defeat her here.
Armin!
We are ordered not to let the titans into the forest, right?
In other words, it is not necessary to fight them now.
Don't you argue?
Black signal!
Right behind us!
This is exactly what the right flank was inspired by.
Reveal the swords.
If we see the enemy, we will have only a moment.
Let's go!
Hurry!
We can't get away from her because of the trees. She will catch us.
Captain, let's turn off the engines!
Captain!
You can't get away!
Reinforcements behind us!
Captain, what should we do?
Let's put her down. She's too dangerous. We need to kill her.
I'll cut you into pieces!
You're brainless. You don't even know who you're dealing with.
These people were shooting titans with desensitizers.
Captain Levi?
Captain!
Give us the order!
She's going to catch us now.
We'll kill her here.
We'll shoot her in the forest.
Isn't that right, Captain?
Just come here!
I'm ordering you to shut your ears.
We're moving on.
Captain Levi!
