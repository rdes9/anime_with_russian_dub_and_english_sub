        <pre>In 845, when the titan Colossus and the armored titan, which emerged from nowhere, broke through the wall, our life was completely destroyed.
People left the wall of Mary and retreated behind the wall of Rose, losing the fifth part of the population and the third part of their land.
And now, in 850, it's time to strike back.
The target is ahead of us!
Titan Colossus!
Here he is, our chance!
We won't let him get away!
What?
Long time no see!
Attack of the titans!
Attack of the titans!
The first battle
The first battle
The first battle
The second battle
He's on purpose?
He took off all the cannons!
And the turn!
It was an accident!
So he still has a mind!
But you can't retreat!
Only he can break the walls!
What if I kill him?
You won't catch him!
Got him?
Same!
Take this!
A trap?
No!
Titan?
Colossus?
Disappeared?
Eren!
Where did you get him?
No!
It was like 5 years ago!
He appeared out of nowhere!
And then he disappeared!
I'm sorry I let him go.
No need to apologize!
We didn't have time to move!
It's not the time to talk!
We broke the wall!
We have to break it!
The titans will break in here!
What are you waiting for?
We are already developing an emergency defense plan!
All staff!
Who collided with the titan colossus, report immediately!
Yes!
Good luck to the front group!
Take only what you need!
Don't panic!
If the titans break through,
the same tragedy will happen again
as 5 years ago!
It's our duty to stop them here,
at the gate!
We have to stop them!
We have to stop them here,
at the gate!
We have to stop them here,
at the gate!
We have to stop them here,
at the gate!
We have to stop them here,
at the gate!
We have to stop them here,
at the gate!
We have to stop them here,
at the gate!
We have to stop them here,
at the gate!
Get ready!
Take this!
Take care of yourself!
France! France!
What's wrong with you, Ernest?
Nothing! It will pass soon!
Although, in fact, the situation is bad!
We have nothing to do quickly!
Eight-meter smoke!
We haven't even cleaned the main gates of the balloon yet!
Such things!
There will be a hole!
We will have to leave the city!
Sooner or later they will break through!
Through the Rose Wall!
And in general,
they deserve to be wanted!
They will shoot us all to the last!
Armin!
Calm down!
A lot has changed!
There are more people!
They will not back down before the Titans!
Sorry!
It's all right!
Hey!
Why are you so careless?
Look!
Now I will win again!
Pixis!
I allow you to play with me every month!
You will not learn everything!
Where does this fit, Pixis?
Let me get to you,
Marquis!
You are the most important commander
in the southern garrison!
Is it really that
close?
Maybe we can beat the Titans!
Commander! Urgent report!
Let's play as you like!
Titan Colossus has just appeared!
The gates are destroyed!
Excellent wine!
I will take it with me
in battle for honor!
Hey!
Wait, Pixis!
Pixis!
Wait!
I will not let you go anywhere!
You will gather the troops
and guard my possessions!
Isn't that your duty?
My duty!
Marquis!
Now my people are fighting
in the reed with a deadly
dangerous threat!
Commander, I will give the horse!
And perhaps many of them
have already died!
And many will die
right now while we are
sweetly talking!
Let them die!
Who needs them?
You are on the battlefield!
When you are even in chess,
you have never won!
Do not worry, Your Excellency!
In a real battle,
the commander does not need to lose
in order not to upset the enemy!
Enough!
Marquis,
from the bottom of my heart,
I wish you a pleasant day!
Wait!
Pixis!
Come back!
Pixis!
Pixis!
Remember what you were taught!
You will be divided
and, by the orders of the garrison,
you will supply the soldiers,
deliver the orders
and fight the titans!
The detachment of the interceptor
will be in the vanguard!
The cadets from the supply team
will enter the main forces!
The elite units of the garrison
will go to the rearguard!
Under the orders of the garrison,
the group will be completely destroyed!
The outer gates are destroyed!
The armored titan can appear
at any moment
and take out the inner gates!
No!
It can not be!
If we lose Rose!
Silence!
The vanguard is already going to battle!
We have only one goal!
To protect Rose's wall
at any cost!
Until they evacuate the inhabitants!
Also, as you know,
the escape from the battlefield
is punished with death!
Remember this and stand until the end!
Yes!
Why today?
Tomorrow I will be
already in the central lands!
Did it make you feel better?
No!
No!
No!
Look where you're going!
Jean, what's wrong with you?
What's wrong with me?
Unlike you, I do not want to die!
It's you who will break
into the scouts!
Are you happy?
Soon you will become a snack for the titans!
And I was going to the center tomorrow!
Calm down!
Calm down and die!
No!
Did you forget?
We endured so much in three years!
So many times!
On the verge of death!
Someone even died!
Someone ran away!
Someone was kicked out!
But we survived!
And today too!
You stay alive
and tomorrow you will go
to your center!
Damn it!
Let's go, Daz!
And stop whining!
Yes!
Eren!
When will Tuga come?
Be with me!
What?
We are in different groups!
In battle, everyone will probably interfere!
I will protect you!
What are you doing?
Akkerman!
You are transferred to the rearguard!
Follow me!
But I will be there all the time!
Your opinion does not concern me!
Evacuation is delayed!
We need as many skilled fighters
for surveillance of civilians as possible!
Listen!
Listen!
Enough of orders!
Don't go crazy!
Humanity is on the verge of destruction!
It's not up to your wishes now!
I'm sorry.
Stupid thoughts.
I agree.
I ask you
only one thing.
Please come back
alive.
I'm not going to die.
Only not here.
Never!
I have not seen
or learned what the world is like.
The remains of ancient sources
have nothing to do with
the origin of the titans.
Very little is known about them.
Our knowledge
is based on the reports
provided by the scouts.
That's all.
The titans have not found
any signs of the mind
comparable to ours.
All attempts to dialogue with them
were unsuccessful.
Their body is significantly
different from ours.
There are no sexual organs,
and the way of reproduction
is unknown.
Most of them have a male appearance.
Their body temperature
is extremely high.
For inexplicable reasons,
only human beings
are interested in them.
They seem to be
not striving for anything
but to eat people.
However, judging by the fact
that they have been living
in a desolated territory for more than 100 years,
they eat not to survive,
but to satisfy
their desire
to kill.
That's all.
They represent
a great threat to humanity,
mainly
because of their vitality.
The artillery
known to people from ancient times
was ineffective.
Even the headless titan
continues to live.
Besides,
he may not always grow
the lost head in one or two minutes.
Oh my God!
Not only are they so huge,
but the titans turn out to be invulnerable!
Not exactly.
There is a way
to defeat them.
Aim for this zone.
A deep wound
will stop the regeneration
and the titan will die.
For this purpose,
we use two such swords.
A blow to the vulnerable
place will kill them
and will not let the wound
heal.
Well, Armin,
we got a lot of luck.
If we manage to do it here,
we will earn a lot of respect.
It will happen
before we become
scouts.
Yes, that's right.
Keep in mind,
this time there are a lot of
people who want to join the scouts.
You can't beat me anymore.
What are you saying?
Let's see
how many more titans there are.
Just count
honestly.
34th fight!
To help the avant-garde!
Let's go!
Look how many of them!
Did the avant-garde
defeat them?
They boasted so much!
They boasted so much!
They boasted so much!
They boasted so much!
I knew it would be difficult.
Not so much.
Run!
Stop!
Armin,
stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Armin,
stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
I won't let you get away!
I won't let you get away!
Cacci!
Oh, you nasty beast!
Eren!
Eren!
Wait!
Don't leave without us!
Come on and stop!
I will avenge you for Thomas!
You will not leave!
You will not leave me!
We need to stop it!
Please, no!
No!
No!
Please!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
Why am I sitting and watching my friends being eaten up?
Why can't I even move?
Armin!
Eren! Eren! Eren!
Why are you shouting, Armin?
Look what I found in grandpa's closet!
He hid a book about the world behind the wall!
About the world behind the wall?
You can't keep that!
The guards will see it and arrest me!
Come on! Listen to what's written in it!
It turns out that a large part of the world is covered with a huge layer of water called the ocean!
And it's all salty!
Salty water? I don't believe it!
Salt costs a lot of money!
The merchants would have bought it everywhere!
There's so much of it that you can get an eternity!
Come on, stop it!
And there's so much more interesting stuff!
Firewater, ice, sand!
Now I know that the world behind the wall is much bigger than inside!
The world behind the wall?
And don't tell anyone, okay?
Mom and dad said they were going to visit the world behind the wall soon!
Behind the wall, huh?
Listen, Eren!
It would be great if we could visit the world behind the wall!
Eren!
I'm not going to die here!
Armin!
I...
I'm...
I'm...
I'm going to die...
...behind the wall!
Eren!
Hurry!
No!
No!
