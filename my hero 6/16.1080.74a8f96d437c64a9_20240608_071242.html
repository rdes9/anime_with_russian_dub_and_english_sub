        <pre>Damn, you can't walk! You'll die!
Enough! Go to bed!
I told you not to walk!
Get off me! I'd rather die than you pulling me!
How can you say that?
What's the point of walking now?
I've already told you, sir!
I'll tell you, but you hold on.
Tadaroki has severe burns. Aizawa was seriously injured, too.
But both of them are alive.
The others have also come to consciousness.
Except for Midoriya.
He's still not waking up.
Idiot!
If he dies, I'll kill him!
Tadaroki!
I'll kill you!
Tadaroki!
Tadaroki!

IKOMO
Now everything is fine!
Why?
Because I'm here!
Whoo!
I'm on fire!
Fire Flame!
You lost because youportef against me.
The heroes have always been somewhere on the other side of the TV screen.
I considered them something far from reality, imagined creatures from fantasy.
Keigo! What the hell were you doing in the city?
You thought I wouldn't recognize you, you bastard?
Tell me, what were you doing?
You thought I wouldn't recognize you, you bastard?
You thought I wouldn't recognize you, you bastard?
I got a wing cut.
I thought something happened in the city.
But I changed my mind and went home.
No one saw me.
You're lying to me.
You can't talk, you can't leave, you can't do anything.
Darling, the TV doesn't turn on.
What? I don't care.
Listen, don't go away.
Come on, Jima, find another job.
Once upon a time, my father killed someone for a modest sum.
My mother helped him hide, and as a result, I was born.
Bastard!
Don't turn your back on me, how many times can you repeat?
I'm sorry.
I should have trusted the miracle of Tommy.
Although no, she shouldn't have given birth at all.
If he hadn't appeared, I would still be free.
Listen, don't go away.
My parents were not in their right mind.
And I endured in the hope that I would not be like them.
I thought if I had to endure, if I had to wait too long,
then one day...
Your father was caught.
What?
What should we do, Keigo?
He drove the car away, wanted to leave.
But he was caught.
A hard worker.
A hard worker?
In a moment, the fantasies became a reality.
The one I saw only on TV.
The hero actually existed.
We must run.
The police will come and arrest us.
The shock passed quickly.
I was afraid of being punished for hiding from my father,
but my mother took me by the hand and we left the house.
But she was unable to live on her own.
Let's go to the police.
I tried to do the right thing.
Keigo, get the money anyway.
You are his son.
Otherwise, why did you even give birth?
Why do you need these wings?
Go!
With the wings of rage, I could easily fulfill my mother's request.
However, I...
Tamiya Takamiya is your son, Keigo, right?
The boy has a natural gift.
He must become a hero.
If you accept our offer,
we will take all the expenses of your family into account.
Family?
Is there someone else?
Yes, however,
in order to receive our support,
you will have to break any ties with Takami forever.
Keigo,
today you say goodbye to this name.
You will go through a unique program
of turning into a special hero.
The preparation will be harsh.
Do you agree?
Then I will become a hero like him
and catch bad guys.
I will be able to support people
just like him when he saves me.
Yostrep!
Yostrep!
Thank God!
I was afraid you were dead.
We will be back soon.
Sorry I overslept, and you didn't.
No,
without the technology of the central hospital,
your life would still be hanging on the hair,
and I wouldn't have had an operation in the spirit of a gnome.
Because of this, my body is now like a torn denim.
I'm sorry.
I convinced the commission that I was the one who didn't lead the League.
After all, they had someone capable of creating a gnome.
The operation was successful.
You fell into a gnome,
and the operation was successful.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
The operation was successful.
You fell into a gnome,
and I brought you to Dabi.
He even checked if you were sure,
but the test was passed without any problems.
Dabi believed that you were dead,
and then
he suggested keeping your body
so that you could use it at the right time.
That's how you ended up
in one of the laboratories.
In the end, I had to wait for the best moment
and woke you up.
Hold on.
What's the matter?
I noticed a scratch.
The revolution is about to begin!
And you're not in this area, I'm in charge.
God is the cook.
Mitya is ready.
Slap Mitya!
Goodbye, God is the cook.
I'm sorry.
My health forced me to grab you so badly.
Thank you for saving me.
Bad jeans.
No wonder he's number three.
Where are the local police and the hero?
They won't come.
The police are busy with the criminals
who escaped from prison.
And the heroes closed their agencies
as soon as people started to condemn them.
Who needs these heroes?
I see.
In that case, I'll send my partners here.
And here too?
The mistrust of the heroes grows every day.
Which one?
Over there.
We need to check something before returning to the settlement.
Did she run away?
My dear Keigo.
I'm sorry.
Some terrible people came here.
They demanded that I tell them about the family.
As a result, I told them about you and your father.
Please forgive me.
I don't want to hurt anyone anymore.
So I'm leaving.
All the best to you.
I'm very proud of you.
Takami Keigo!
Did you hire any helpers then?
I can't believe they went so far.
But I guessed that my mother was to blame for the leak.
That's hard.
It's almost like being pressed.
No.
The interruption of all ties with Takami
meant the interruption of my ties with my mother.
I was happy with that.
I turned away from her and didn't save her.
Although I was trying to save people.
I can support people.
Just like he did when he saved me.
My own actions have now come to me.
But that's even better.
Although these are not the most appropriate words.
The Security Commission is basically gone.
I have no one to give me orders now.
Nothing else.
I'm not connected.
Just don't tell my father.
My mother brought me there.
So that I would stop constantly begging outside.
It will work.
But there is no money for the Almighty.
When you grow up, you will become as strong as him.
But in reality...
Jinx...
The true nature of a person is manifested
when he is cornered.
Or when he becomes free.
That's why Bubai Gawara was good.
If you don't take into account his actions,
the fact is that he tried to help others.
I want that too.
Why do you need these wings?
I...
I...
I...
I want to do the right thing.
Even if Dami told the truth about the Todoroki family.
Since then, everything has changed.
So what do you want to do?
There is still a lot of unfinished business.
I'll start with my roots.
Because the hard worker...
is in trouble.
Sleep.
Panic began in the cities.
We have not yet been able to assess the damage of the last days.
As the catastrophe with the mass escape of the prisoners of evil happened.
Onomu became the last drop.
I remember the rumors that the hard worker was talking about.
The stories of eyewitnesses about Onomu have surfaced more and more.
Since the appearance of humanoid creatures at the U.A. school,
the thought of them has troubled people.
Somewhere in the depths of the soul.
There were more and more rumors.
And with them, worries and worries grew.
And after a series of defeats of the heroes
and the escape of the criminals from prison,
people finally reached the boiling point.
For starters, give me some food and money.
I can do what I want, but I can't believe it.
The gods themselves are smiling at me right now.
It won't last long.
You see who decides what to do.
Does he have a device?
On the heroes!
We do not rely on it anymore.
The eyewitnesses of Senjuku Adori report on the appearance of Cider House.
To all the heroes nearby, urgently there!
Bury!
The seeds are already sown.
Yes, the seeds are already sown.
The people who put the cross on the heroes
have found a way to defend themselves.
He has been on the market for a long time.
Bury?
The armed, uneducated civilians
began to enter the battle with the criminals.
And thus, they inflicted even more damage.
It was not long before the war began.
It was not long before the war began.
They inflicted even more damage.
It's not been two days.
Such incidents became commonplace across the country.
Bury!
You are late!
What were you busy with?
We got stuck there.
We could not leave the house, so we sat quietly and waited.
And where did you get stuck, Styrka?
The heroes have become much smaller.
After all the losses, I can only put down my weapons.
Not too well-known and not too successful.
The heroes of the Middle Ages, who still relied on glory in their youth.
Have you decided to give up?
Get out of here!
The heroes of the Middle Ages, who still relied on glory in their youth.
Get out of here!
The hero number nine, the hero Musya, has given up.
Why are you leaving now?
What about you? I was your fan!
From that moment on, many began to follow his example.
All people took the world as they should.
How many of them again?
Asked the question, what does it mean to be a hero?
And how many heroes?
At the same time, people sat down.
They put all the responsibility for this on the shoulders of one single person.
Shots and other students are now healthy.
You also miraculously survived.
Effort.
I'm on your side.
I can already breathe.
My head is constantly spinning.
The painkillers are still working.
I'm alive.
Come on, let's dance in the water!
I already knew then that I would survive the battle.
Please move, protect them!
Hey, you'll deal with this later!
I couldn't move.
Just like that time.
My son was in danger, and I...
I just froze.
Yes, then Bejins proved the mistake of part of his words.
But you can't get back the trust.
As long as I didn't justify his expectations.
He put a cross on me a long time ago.
I was abandoned and forgotten.
It's coming back.
Everything I did in the past impairs me.
Even if I survive,
the hero-doer will still die.
I couldn't fight my son.
Pa...
What the...
Father, it's so good that we finally met.
Are you all right, son?
Why are you crying?
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.
It's too late.
I'm sorry.
Now it's my fault.
My soul.
More.
What about your soul?
Unfortunately, we have a little less wine than you have.
Ray?
Why are you here?
I came to talk.
About our family.
And also...
About Toya.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
hard version
Look, Daya.
The Toda-Roki family gathered in theningar.
They discuss the past of Toya's eldest son.
And for the family, the road is the story of how it fell apart.
Next, they don't put out the fire like that.
This is the story of how the family will be reborn.
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
