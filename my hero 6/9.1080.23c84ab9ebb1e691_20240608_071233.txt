Class 1A and 1B go through a joint combat training and are almost equal.
At the end of the third fight, both classes have a victory and draw.
And so the fourth round begins.
Come on, what? Seriously?
It can't be!
Enough!
You'll see, damn it!

Take this!
You can't take everything from me!
Take this!
If they don't make the first step, we're done for.
It's all nonsense.
Let's go and beat them up.
The birdie is cleaning his nose earlier.
Let's go after them.
Now the classes have a draw after the victory and defeat.
It may seem that they are on the same page.
However, the classes mostly won thanks to Shinsu.
Do you really think it's the same?
It's very ugly to say that.
His miracle is blood control, and it's still boiling.
He's overflowing with love.
That's all.
Go away.
We have a legal protest here.
Are you going to say that in a real battle too?
Class B is working harder on plans and countermeasures.
You can't argue with that.
Apparently, the truth is on the side of the government.
You have only problems.
Did you know that problems usually come from immature people?
Class B worked hard every day and developed.
However, the class has not shown everything yet.
Do you like the class, all-powerful?
I like everyone.
I can't wait to see what you're going to do, young Bakugo.
Move, brakes!
I have to listen on the move.
Just run after me.
Are you always waiting for everyone to follow you?
And you haven't changed since the sports festival.
Well, at least now he's cooperating.
Although...
Listen here, servants.
For now, just follow me.
You would change the tone.
And we're not your servants.
I'll lead you forward.
And you get ready to help, if anything.
Ears!
Listen, where are all the weaklings now?
I'm not your ears, I'm Jiro.
And you're going to attack?
Our opponent is good at counterattacks.
And with us, Jiro, we'll wait for a convenient moment.
Wait and quietly...
Fool.
That's why we have to act first.
We won't wait for anything.
We'll create an opportunity ourselves.
We'll see them, we'll win.
Is that clear?
It's dangerous.
Take them just in case.
They are weak, but useful.
And also...
And our plan...
Will definitely work.
And here they are.
Ears!
I'm Jiro!
They are somewhere nearby.
Find them!
Hurry up!
Wait a minute!
They noticed me!
And that's it.
I used Jiro's ability against her.
Setsuna Takagi from Class B.
Heroic name...
Sparrow-like.
Spell...
Self-amputation.
Divide the body into parts and can move them.
She developed her magic so that now she can have 50 points.
I got it.
Bakuga, come here!
That's...
That's it.
Shkval, glue!
What?
Glue?
Damn, we shouldn't have done that.
It's like we made a web ourselves to get ourselves into it.
Oh, great.
Everything is going according to Setsuna's plan.
Kojiro Bunda from Class B.
Heroic name...
Plamo.
Spell...
Semidin.
He shoots the glue and also controls the drying speed.
You're too slow!
Kamariki Togura from Class B.
Heroic name...
Jack Bogomol.
Spell...
Asteria.
Creates blades from any part of the body.
I got rid of the fat by creating noise in different places.
Bunda covered the glue with the tube and tape.
If you touch them, you won't get away.
I'll at least protect my own!
Bakuga!
Bakuga!
What I need!
I'll take Zajiro first!
Save for victory.
Win for the sake of saving.
Actually, I've become much stronger!
Also,
when you're in danger,
I'll come to you for help.
What? Blocked?
How long have Bukashki become so fast?
Come on!
Thank you!
Get off!
They ran away!
Look for them!
I don't care if we have a lesson or something!
Okay, I've already decided.
I'll win every battle.
4-0.
No injuries.
That's it!
The real strong ones win!
Hey, wait!
Did I get something in my eye or something?
It seemed that he protected Zajiro.
Yes, he protected him.
Right, Pinko?
That's our Bakuga.
Don't worry, Onama.
Everything is fine with his eyes.
So, his character has changed?
Well, maybe.
Actually, it's the first time I've seen him risk himself so openly.
You can't fight Bakuga in the forehead.
You have to step back.
If we fight as usual, we will definitely lose.
That's why we step back.
If we can't capture them, then we will attack again.
And so we will keep the advantage.
How loud!
True, now there are fewer of them.
Fewer?
And everyone is moving away!
They decided to get together?
Damn, they underestimate us!
There is one Bakuga in the enemy team.
The rest follow him.
If we create stress factors and Bakuga makes a mistake,
their team will be exhausted.
It's hard to figure out in sounds,
but if they concentrate, I'll distract them.
Let's go!
He hid and sat quietly.
Another turn!
Fast construction.
Urgent work!
Ready!
Avassa Yosezu from Class B.
Heroic name welder.
Miracle welder.
He is able to solder things on a molecular level.
However, for the work of a miracle,
he first needs to touch the glass.
And then he can do it.
You will never catch me here with your tape.
Takagi thought of this and really foresaw everything.
Sugar jump!
Come on!
You will not weld me!
No, I will not!
I will not!
You will not weld me!
There is no need to be so angry!
Come on!
Now!
I will do it!
When you are in danger, I will come to help you.
And when I am in danger,
the sound of heartbeats!
You will come to help me.
Avassa!
There is also a bomb!
Damn!
It's so hard to fight in winter!
Now I have warmed up!
I took him!
What a quick team work!
In an instant, two of my dear students were caught!
I thought he was not able to work in the team.
Not in his spirit to calm down.
Bakugo!
Bakugo acts on his own.
The rest help him.
You need to find a good opportunity
to use it until they break.
X!
Catapult!
Why is their team so perfect?
All thanks to the fact that he trusts Jiro and the rest.
The game in the group helped!
The game on drums!
The game on drums!
The game on drums!
The game on drums!
The game on drums!
Takagi divides the body into 50 parts
and moves them.
Certain parts will stop moving after a while.
Then she will grow them on her own.
I'm still thinking about the next part.
But I doubt she will be able to recover endlessly.
For sure, like Jiro and Rose,
in a tired state, she is less focused.
If she divided as much as possible for the sake of Shomon,
then maybe it will be harder for her to grow new parts.
So Takagi will return some of those that are moving.
So she will be able to regenerate faster.
Jiro said that the sounds became less.
So I'm probably right!
It's dangerous!
Hey!
You!
You've changed too much!
I haven't changed.
I always had one goal.
I want to surpass the Almighty
and become a hero.
How?
How?
It didn't take them five minutes!
Thanks to the unexpected teamwork,
Class A wins with an ideal score of 4-0!
There was no unnecessary destruction.
You quickly captured and arrested them.
You focused on the mobility and strength of Bakug
and helped him perfectly.
Your plan was reliable.
You took into account the data and skills.
It's a pity that you didn't adjust to circumstances like Hananuki.
Guys, I'm sorry I embarrassed you.
Come on!
You just have to learn from this defeat!
Since such a capable guy has become a good one,
there's nothing for us to grab on to.
That's for sure!
Nothing!
Kachan, it turns out you can do that!
Jiro was a real heroine!
Only I'm a hero.
Like a criminal helped a stray cat.
Only I'm a human.
Oh, you're a bum.
Maybe you're sick.
Kachan!
Get off!
I'm not even standing in front of you.
I'm moving on.
Yeah, you're good.
With my pace, you can't catch up with me.
I'll hurry.
Get off!
Did you come for this?
I won't let you beat me!
You're an idiot.
You'll see.
You have a good childhood friend.
Go to hell!
I wish you were a little nicer.
That lousy, lousy, hysterical, fiery guy!
He was great!
Monomo, I'm sorry.
With one victory, two defeats, and a draw, Class B won't win anymore.
Why are you apologizing, Takagi?
Our immature companions thought about his actions and got better.
That's good.
Class B agrees not to win anymore.
But we haven't lost yet.
I just want people to understand.
Some students worked hard and didn't fix the trouble,
and others deservedly attracted their attention to all the crap.
So whose path is it?
Every secondary character in the lives of other people.
But in their own way, they are all the main characters!
So what do we do?
Don't whine here!
I think we should do about the same as Takagi's team.
After all, our composition is similar in terms of balance of forces.
We have a lot of guys with technical tricks.
It's better to hide and hit from behind.
Besides, there will be five of us.
A close fight won't give us anything.
But you saw their fight.
Will Midoriya tell you not to freeze your soul?
Freeze?
She meant that he was scary.
Midoriya?
In terms of mobility and combat skills,
is he on par with Bakugo or higher?
Right?
And Midoriya recently learned to attack from afar.
If we give him a little bit of weakness, we will also lose.
He can find a way out of the situation.
So Midoriya will be our main task.
At any cost, we have to get rid of him first.
However, that time he coped with my trick.
However, in combination with Monome's trick,
I think we'll get rid of him.
It's scary when you stand out so much.
After all, I can scare him.
What?
He says he won't be able to copy him.
In any case, if we don't get rid of him, we won't be able to do anything.
We're counting on you, Shinsou.
Here's the fifth and last fight.
I wonder how Shinsou is doing there.
His job will decide whether he will be able to move.
In the first fight, he showed his independence.
However, will his trick work again?
That's for sure.
Class A's team is strong too.
I hope he can handle it.
Shouldn't we go after Shinsou right away?
I'm starting to worry.
I want you to control me.
Don't worry about that.
There are a lot of guys in that team who can attack from anywhere.
And we can lift, dissolve, attach.
Everything is very bad.
No chance.
We can't wait.
Attack too.
Let's go!
We'll be able to turn my escape from the vineyard operation.
No one will buy that.
In general, we must first find them and lure them into the trap.
Then I'll be a bait.
Deku?
And how are you going to do it?
You said you had a miracle.
Yes.
But everything is fine.
The problem is that they saw our fight.
I think the enemy will be watching me.
We'll have to move even more.
Can you do it?
We're counting on you.
I can.
We will definitely win.
Yes! Hooray! Hooray!
And where did this confidence come from?
Everything works fine.
I'm moving on.
You can't catch up to me with my pace.
After what he said, I can't be ashamed.
It's time for the fifth fight.
He's the last one for today.
Are you ready?
Spread out to the very end.
Let's get started!
Let's go!
Let's go!
In the next episode.
This is the last fight of the joint training.
The class wins when they win or lose.
But you can't relax.
After all, the class is in B-shinso.
Imono with a miracle of copying.
I am our key to victory.
I am the key to victory.
I am the key to victory.
I am the key to victory.
I am the key to victory.
I am our key to victory.
I am the key to victory.
Next, what has been inherited.
Something weird is happening inside me.
Out of the limits! Plus Ultra!
