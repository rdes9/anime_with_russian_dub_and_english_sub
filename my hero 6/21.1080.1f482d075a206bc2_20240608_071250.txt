When the superpowers only found out, chaos began, and then, in an attempt to find a peaceful way of coexistence,
one ideology spread among superhumans — not to suppress, but to liberate.
The freedom of use of superpowers was considered a natural right.
This is what Chikara Yotsubashi preached.
He called himself Destro — a man who destroys the present.
Destro gathered the supporters of liberation and created the Superhuman Liberation Army.
For several years they fought the government and lost.
Many supporters were arrested, and the Liberation Army fell apart.
Destro wrote this book in prison and committed suicide.
He didn't even know that he had a child.
How are things going?
We found people connected to the League.
It's better to go to them as soon as possible.
They are the enemies of the Liberation Army.
Since the government continues to sit at the mercy of the hand, we will have to deal with them ourselves.
So we will destroy the League of Villains in the name of Destro.
Destro is now the leader of the Superhuman Liberation Army.
He is the leader of the Superhuman Liberation Army.
He is the leader of the Superhuman Liberation Army.
He is the leader of the Superhuman Liberation Army.
He is the leader of the Superhuman Liberation Army.
He is the leader of the Superhuman Liberation Army.
He is the leader of the Superhuman Liberation Army.
He is the leader of the Superhuman Liberation Army.
He is the leader of the Superhuman Liberation Army.
He is the leader of the Superhuman Liberation Army.
He is the leader of the Superhuman Liberation Army.
He is the leader of the Superhuman Liberation Army.
He is the leader of the Superhuman Liberation Army.
He is the leader of the Superhuman Liberation Army.
He is the leader of the Superhuman Liberation Army.
He is the leader of the Superhuman Liberation Army.
He is the leader of the Superhuman Liberation Army.
He is the leader of the Superhuman Liberation Army.
Star Media
This is a model of provinciality.
It's neither big nor small.
The atmosphere is pleasant.
This Liberation Army has 110,000 people.
The mahi will wake up in an hour and 40 minutes.
He will chase the Shigaraki and find the Liberation Army.
He will chase the Shigaraki and find the Liberation Army.
They will beat each other and we will win.
The only question is whether we will hold on so long.
And why should I even participate in all this?
It's Giron who brought you into the League.
So what?
You're a freak.
Someone's coming.
Stop!
I was ordered to show you the way.
If you need the leader of the Liberation Army, follow me.
He's a hero.
I don't know him, though.
There's no one here.
I see.
So the whole city.
That's right.
This is Deiko City.
It's a liberated area, 90% of the population of which are our soldiers.
Thank you for making such a way.
Today is a great day, and you are our honorable guests.
This is Hanabas, the party of the hearts of the minds.
Is someone important?
So, let's get started.
The Liberation Army Revival Festival.
They really have 110,000.
I don't care, we're already here.
Where's Giron?
Your man is waiting together with our commander.
You said you'd let him go if we came.
Shigaraki Tomura!
We're going to the tower.
I'm good at this.
No!
The Earth exploded.
She died of blood loss.
The culprit is Toga the chemist, right?
Why did the senior classmate go crazy?
She gave a shocking interview before she died.
Talk.
What?
No.
You made two mistakes.
First, it's not funny to make an old man a devil in trouble.
No one will appreciate it.
And second, if they give the will of the created Nomu,
there will be no stone left from the city.
They won't let Nomu out.
For three reasons.
I have more.
First, the stone itself.
Nomu appears only with Liga.
And recently they have become a rumor.
Despite the fact that the Liga itself is still active.
Secondly, there will be no such level as Nomu in Kyushu.
Remember the white Nomu, separated from the black one.
They still had human remains.
But there were no superpowers.
And the third reason.
I just came to take that Nomu.
Dabi said he was taking the black one.
That means there are no other nomu who work normally.
Therefore, it should be noted that Nomu is an understatement,
a commodity for its customer.
All for one.
Liga does not have enough people to use them freely.
And the Liga of villains without Nomu is just a pitiful collection.
Each of them is strong.
Secret wars of liberation were practiced here every day.
Without an end, they sharpened their bodies and minds.
In an attempt to live humanly.
Therefore, we do not like that you...
...appeared late, for no particular reason.
And now everyone has only chemistry in their mouths.
It seems you do not like it.
I'm sorry.
I got rid of the humiliation in front of the reporter.
Toga Chimica.
You will give me everything you want.
The Liga of villains is not interesting at all.
But you are a different matter.
True to the cruel crimes of the girl.
The title will be great.
The blood was boiling like in the days of journalism.
She is not.
It is not surprising that she cannot be caught.
Where is she?
The murder without any hesitation.
How interesting.
Tell me, what was your life like?
Oh, you're more careful there.
Our wars are ruthless.
Do you want to live longer?
Give me an interview.
What are you talking about?
I'm not talking about you.
I'm talking about you.
What more?
Give me an interview.
Kizukichitose.
The villain's name is curious.
Prichudamino.
Touch turns into a bomb anything.
Takes not strength, but quantity.
Spray?
That's how you do it.
You swallow blood to change.
You can take from several times.
When you don't know who you will become, you can behave like everyone else, and you also have survival skills that ordinary killers don't have.
Where did you learn that?
The blood exploded!
Don't hope to turn into someone and hide.
There are warriors among us who want to become bombs themselves.
The eldest daughter of the Toga family was born on August 7. At the age of 17, she disappeared after the release. Did you watch an honest interview with your parents?
And how do you like the recording of conversations with classmates?
Everyone said in a row that you were a joyful and obedient child.
So what happened? Why did you start doing this?
Oh, I understand. I understand your pain. Can you tell me about it yourself?
Kizuki.
Don't get your attention with such words, Mas.
Recording and rumors don't touch anyone anymore.
Make an interview. Look them in the eye.
In the article that will change people's opinion, there must be a soul of a person.
With your soul, I will change people's opinion.
This is all for the sake of the liberation army.
Tell me, how did you go crazy?
A normal life.
Such a doll face.
Finally, you answered me.
The liberation army wants to create an incredibly beautiful world.
You can say that they want to create an incredibly beautiful world.
And they want to create an incredibly beautiful world.
And they want to create an incredibly beautiful world.
An incredibly beautiful world.
You can say that I love you.
I will also live a normal life.
A middle school student who stabbed her classmates is still on the run.
The investigation continues.
She always smiled. She was very sociable.
She still can't believe it.
I saw Togo then.
She held a tube in her hand and sucked blood out of Saito's wounds.
She was like in a trance.
Her face was disgusting.
We can't atone for our guilt.
We tried, but nothing came out.
She is a devil's child.
Papa! Papa!
This bird is so cute!
So cute!
To live a normal life.
That's an interesting phrase.
So here's your real face.
After all, instincts didn't deceive me.
You are a real embodiment of superhuman society.
Poor thing.
You are covered inside and outside.
You are a poor girl who killed her own destiny with the pressure of superpowers.
You are like that, aren't you, Togo the chemist?
Because of your innate superpowers, you have become interested in blood over time.
How cute! How beautiful!
Unfortunately, you have a completely normal sense of admiration.
You are interested in blood.
And our society was unable to accept the fusion of these two factors in any way.
That's why you decided to end it.
You suppressed yourself by wearing a mask.
Stop it! What are you doing?
Stop smiling like that!
Terrible face.
How is he not normal?
Why can't you be normal?
Get away from me!
Detnerat property.
Chain ring.
A curious blow.
Your norms and goals of the Liberation Army are the same.
That's why you will become the one who confirms the loyalty of the Liberation Army.
Your life will be described in our modern sacred text.
Tell me if I'm wrong in something.
Tell me everything in your own words.
Without this, the interview will not be complete.
No!
You can't run away!
You came here yourself!
Here's the bastard.
I'm not unhappy at all.
When I'm happy, I smile at you.
It's like kissing your lover.
Only I swallow the blood of my love.
I'm not unhappy at all.
Do you have any more supplies?
God, just don't cry.
I know that your superpowers allow you to change your appearance.
Do you want to be beautiful at the end?
Oh, poor thing.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Oh, poor thing.
The last blood of those times.
All I have left is the person who trusts the tongue.
I'm lucky.
I'm lucky.
I also want to get closer to my beloved.
I beg you.
Tell me.
No!
I want to be like you.
I'm caught by the police and the hero.
Over time, I got into what was happening around me.
When I pretended to be a high school teacher,
the world became a little kinder.
I won't get caught.
I won't get caught.
I won't get caught.
I won't get caught.
I won't get caught.
Now I own the miracle of Chaco.
What?
The miracle only allows her to change her appearance.
Did you really strengthen her now?
Because of the fear of death, your superpowers?
No.
I will live, love and die normally.
I want to be more.
Like my love.
What a great headline.
The best article.
We chop them, chop them.
They will chop everything.
You haven't chopped anything yet.
Toga is missing.
Where is she?
Damn it.
Just like with Izuku.
It would be better if I didn't kill her.
But I couldn't hold myself.
I hate her.
She must be destroyed.
Yes, Tomura?
I want to sleep.
When you want to sleep,
it seems that everything around you is moving and you can hear everything.
You seem to be overloaded with unnecessary information.
I know that my body is empty now.
What is it?
Another memory.
I don't remember what happened.
I only remember what I felt at that moment.
Then my shoulder fell.
Oh, why was it?
Everything is fine with me.
If you show it, show it all.
I'm rooting for you, Tenko.
It's like a broken tape recorder.
Damn, I'm sick of it.
I'm sick of it already.
Did it seem to me?
Or did his decay go to something he didn't touch?
Shigaraki, are you really...
If the chief can do this, then so can I.
I was afraid of him.
I was afraid of him.
I was afraid of him.
I was afraid of him.
I was afraid of him.
If the chief can do this, then so can I.
I'm sick of killing people.
Ice.
Ice means...
Well done.
You're big, but you're good at hiding.
I think I've gotten a little stronger too.
Although now I understand it.
You're probably strong.
What?
Yes, with the blue flame.
The only long-range villain of the League.
Why didn't you hit the flame right away?
Are you waiting for something?
Or do you have problems with superpowers?
Hey, listen, it looks like you don't know anything.
Well, I'll have to explain to you.
My flame is special.
It melts ice.
I see.
That's bad.
If you don't know, I'll explain.
I control the ice.
All my life I've been using my superpowers.
I don't even go to school.
I've been doing it longer than any hero.
The chief made me strong.
You have a wonderful life.
I feel so sorry for you.
Don't hope that your flame will melt my ice.
Dabi!
Give me your power!
Everyone's divided.
Let's sum it up.
Dabi is over there.
Shigaraki and Spinner were together.
Toga ran away and disappeared.
Where's Twice?
He was just here.
It's not true.
It's true.
You ran away somewhere.
I was worried.
I didn't care.
Damn it!
What is this?
Toga!
Oh no!
Oh no!
It's not true.
It's terribly cold.
Damn it!
Why is it so hot?
Shut up!
What?
There's blood everywhere.
Is she breathing?
Yes.
No.
What's wrong with her face?
Is it the enemy's blood?
It's her blood.
We need to wipe it out.
Do you remember?
No.
You gave me this scarf.
Forget it.
Don't be sorry, girl.
No, you have to live.
You were the one who belonged to everyone in the League, including me.
The only one who needed such a missing person.
Damn it!
I'm going to kill them all!
Twice found Toga.
She's under the influence of Ikeda.
Toga is still alive.
For the sake of the curious, we need to finish her off for sure.
Twice.
A miracle double.
In some sense, he is the opposite of Toga.
He made his copies, and they almost killed him.
As a result, he lost the feeling of himself.
In order to survive humanly, you freed the super-power, and in the end, you were left with an injured soul.
Chikazaku Tamayasu!
The villain's name is Skeptic!
The miracle Anthropomorph!
It turns objects the size of a person, like fridges, into marionettes.
With your power.
Even if something happens to Radestra, we will be able to bring him back.
The tragedy of Destra will not repeat.
You understand, Bubaygavara.
That's why this power.
As you can't see your own value.
I'll make you join the Liberation Army.
The kindness that I've been hoping for
Will someday become the kindness I've been waiting for
If I could connect with you beyond myself
I'll see the line that will never come again
The sadness that was thrown away
That no one can convey
Let's see the flames that were flamed
It's not a lie
It's not a lie
The future from now on
I feel like I can connect with you no matter where you are
Because someday I will definitely save you from the nightmare
Because I can save you
In the next episode.
Liberation Army Revival Day.
In front of my superior numbers.
The gang of villains led by Garaki were cornered.
In the midst of the battle.
Twice finds out that the chemist is wounded.
Next.
The parade of the sad.
The miracle of the double.
This is a sad procession.
Go beyond.
Plus Ultra.
