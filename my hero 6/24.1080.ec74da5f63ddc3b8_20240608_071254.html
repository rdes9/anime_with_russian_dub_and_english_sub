        <pre>I killed my family. Then I ran away from home. I didn't know what to do.
What am I supposed to do now? Whoever it is, tell me. Help me.
I was stuck in a puddle. I couldn't say a word.
What's wrong with you, baby?
What happened, baby?
I'm sure the heroes or the police will come soon. And I have to hurry to work, okay?
The denser the population of the city, the higher the probability of bad events.
Some are much more urgent than a lost child. Our society is overflowing with heroes.
I thought they wouldn't come after me, because this is my punishment for the murder of my own family.
If only at that moment, if only then, someone would help me.
It's over.
HEY, BROTHER, LISTEN!
I can't do it like that, I can't do it like that, I can't do it like that, I can't do it like that, I can't do it like that, I can't do it like that, I can't do it like that, I can't do it like that, I can't do it like that, I can't do it like that, I can't do it like that, I can't do it like that, I can't do it like that, I can't do it like that, I can't do it like that, I can't do it like that, I can't do it like that, I can't do it like that, I can't do it like that, I can't do it like that, I can't do it like that, I can't do it like that, I can't do it like that, I can't do it like that, I can't do it like that, I can't do it like that, I can't do it like that, I can't do it like that

and now it's around
You have a tendency to destruction that is too strong, you can't control it, it overflows you and is expressed in the form of this rod,
you don't have to suffer anymore, because there is nothing wrong with it,
what's the matter, in general, on the street of the helmet, I thought we would let you go if you are a child, but there is no
god, poor thing, and why are you so afraid, just do it as your soul desires, otherwise you will only suffer in loneliness
pain, conscience, morality, ethics, these are only human concepts, they were invented by those who need an ideal world, do not hold back because of them, do not be afraid of what is inside you,
it is much more important than anything else, so what do you want, they hit me, I want to kill them, I don't know why, but I feel something bad and it doesn't go away, I can't hold it,
then lay down on everything, now there are so many heroic agencies, how did they get it,
hold them closer to your skin so that these feelings do not go away with the flow of time,
this is so strange, I thought he had lost his memory, it was simply blocked, and so all the memories inside the hands of the members of his family
hold him down as if they were hiding, having lost his memory, the boy became uneven on the surface, only emotions come out, he is restless, look how subconsciously he protects his wonder,
but I am ready to accept everything right now, the boy took a big step on the way to turning into a symbol of fear that yearns for destruction, I am sick of it, I don't understand why I am so calm, it seems that no matter what I do, they will forgive me,
congratulations, you held back your tears and squeezed your teeth, you were reborn, this is a gift, I give you two hands in honor of your new life,
two, but there are five of them, these are spare, if some of them break, with their help you will never forget that day, this is like holding a newborn baby in the hands or taking care of the old man,
and now let's show me what you are shigaraki tomura
shigaraki tomura tomura translates as sorrow as a sign of your regret and forgiveness shimura tenko was reborn in the one who will make others grieve and shigaraki this is my last name now I remembered everything that day I killed my father
that day I killed my father because I wanted it so much from the view of the collapse of my mother and sister, it became easier for me in my soul for me it was not a tragedy, I really just destroyed I don't need the future
, the evil league can then say everything that comes to mind, but I don't need anything, I'm 100 percent stressed, it should have been
redestro
if you manage to destroy it on time, this is not a problem, you are just huge, I understand destroying what you hate with all your might is very funny
with the help of my strength, everything will end, I will free people, I will fulfill the desire to destroy
what is it that the pulsation spreads through the body by waves, this is fear, although no,
because I can turn fear into strength, that's why it seems to you that something held you redestro why my stress decreases
rickie we live on our knees hiding from everyone now you will fulfill the will of destro take revenge for his regret
, the property of the death rate is a pressurizing mechanism of increasing the time of the
stress by 150 percent, but how good it was close, don't come close, he hasn't noticed us yet, I feel it
in my hand, it's good, of course, that he distracted them, but he is too strong, you need to find everyone as soon as possible,
at least once he woke up earlier, we will face him now and the league is over, and I was just going to set fire to
that ice moron doctor, as you can hear, take us away from here, it's a nightmare, we'll all die, you want to kill
John every time he moves people, I don't care, try, and this is a lie, you are free to use them,
I try not to get too close to people whose location is known when you don't have an army at your tail,
then we'll talk, you don't care that shigaraki will die, he is the heir to all for one, that's why he needs to be cornered
fighting with a super power league, pay attention to everything, follow the long-range flame of dabia,
you are a cornerstone of the army, I'm sorry, I didn't want you to worry,
you need to protect radestro, hold on,
one hundred and fifty percent means it's just like plus ultra
master's receiver,
do not suppress, free use of superpowers, the right of a man from birth
in the time of awakening after so many sufferings it turns out as with this guy
you get rid of everything
exactly
that's what's in my chest
if I go away
don't be afraid, look at it like this, the life of people, achievements and hard work, everything is in your hands,
you decide to squeeze and break them or ride around like a toy, if you have hatred and joy, you will be free
let everything die
your legs did not touch the ground, cut them off so that the body does not fall apart, listen to why we fought with you
because you yourself ran into a fight
radestro
chief commander
oh no
people save the chief commander
the awakening was canceled, oh no
rupper
worse than this
only senseless death
free use of superpowers, do not suppress, free use
oh great deestro
if the one who embodies freedom should be at the front line of liberation, then this is a young man who is at the front line of liberation
should be the one who embodies freedom, then this is a young man who was laughing at the weight of history, laughing at the purpose of bloodthirsty, because they limit it, I already see this
this young man seems to shine
They all agreed with my, or rather, with the pre-death wish of Destro.
They came ready to become martyrs.
You're right. I broke through myself and lost.
I was going to kill once.
But know that I am ready to give my life for the last wish of Destro.
The Liberation Army will follow you.
Nice to meet you.
If we were to work with the pre-death wishes,
maybe now we would be eating sushi.
You're the director of Death Narad, aren't you?
That means you have a lot of money.
The tragedy hit the peaceful city.
The criminal group was lured by the scumbags.
It was a planned attack.
The residents of Deika, faced with a sudden threat,
united and began to resist.
The heroes connected later, when they realized what had happened.
As a result, many residents died.
But they were able to kill all 20 criminals.
That's where it all ended.
I'm sorry.
The owners and the director of Death Narad were also in Deika at that time.
Yotsubashi Riki was badly hurt.
Although he had to amputate both legs, he survived.
Some believe that the use of the pre-death,
not taught by the civilian, only worsened the situation.
But in the beginning, the situation was not so bad.
However, the incident left many questions behind.
Probably, the protocol says that if you don't kill, you make it stronger.
You didn't do anything.
Oh, stop it.
That's how I coped with the victory.
If you don't, I'll eat it.
Come on, I don't want to.
I don't want to.
I don't want to.
I don't want to.
If you don't, I'll eat it.
Come on, I hate fish.
Togo, forgive me.
If only you didn't lose so much blood.
Then now I would ...
Please stop.
I'm alive, so don't.
Well, let's not do what others don't like.
Damn, the leg is moving itself.
What's wrong with your leg?
I was bad, don't hit me.
What? I, what did you say?
What? What did you say?
I thought you recovered from the injury.
There's a lot of you in you again.
It looks like this treatment has only made him worse.
It's time to go out.
Shut up! We haven't finished eating the sushi yet!
These sushi were bought for our money.
The medical service, video editing, and Togi's jacket were also paid by us.
What? If it weren't for us, this bald guy would have been in the hospital, not in this shelter.
Stop being a skeptic.
The main thing is that Redestro chose these people.
And his words are still considered to be the words of Destro himself.
Hello! Thank you for coming!
War Liberation!
I'm Redestro from the Superhuman Liberation Army.
Now our army will be reborn!
What's going on? It seemed to me that all the tomars' hands had fallen apart.
One of them has survived.
It's a miracle that her original form has not been damaged.
Is this a trademark for him?
I was always sure that the League of Villains was a barrier.
Until that very day.
My eyes used to be closed.
I was a prisoner of blood.
I was caught in the trap of their knowledge.
And now I have seen a new liberation.
This is not a retreat at all.
Shigaraki Tomura is the only one who is really free.
In the blessed tremble, I have become a full-fledged.
From now on, the army recognizes Tomura Shigaraki as the commander-in-chief.
This is the second time.
We will go further on the path of liberation.
The Superhuman Liberation Army and the League of Villains will unite under a new name.
Let's go, let's go.
It was invented by me, Redestro and Spinner from the League of Villains.
Name the new name, Shigaraki Tomura.
Supernatural Liberation Front.
We removed the word of the villains, and the prefix super received a wider interpretation.
Nine people on this stage will become my assistants.
The teams are assigned according to their needs.
However, this name does not matter that this thing is just for appearance.
We do what we want.
You did a great job.
Do you want to drink?
Go away.
Gladly. Rupert, we're leaving.
I didn't want him to become like this.
Hey!
He was so hurt.
It's a miracle that he's still alive.
Supernatural Liberation Front.
What a pathetic name.
However, it's probably better than the cheap League of Villains.
Mahir listened to me.
I believe I have reached the minimum level you talked about.
Yes, you have regained your memory.
You are the same as you were made and the same with the miracle.
I will keep my word.
I will give you strength if you crave it so much.
Supernatural Liberation Front
Supernatural Liberation Front
Supernatural Liberation Front
In the next episode
Shigaraki Tomura is now in charge of the Liberation Army.
When the heroes learn about this, they begin to prepare for the fight against the villains.
The expected battle is getting closer.
Yoei's students are also drawn to this change.
Next, the high blue sky.
The signal fire to war is already lit.
Go beyond. Plus Ultra!
