        <pre>You just watch.
You're having fun as if you went on a picnic.
You underestimate us.
Get ready, class!
Today we will decide who is stronger!
Heroic faculty of UAE.
Class 1A and 1B go through local combat training.
In the first battle...
...Ri Chudashinsu successfully interfered with the team work of Class B.
And Class A won.
That's it!
It's done!
Yeah!
Please go to the intelligence, Takayami.
Takayami-san!
I got it.
Dark shadow!
I'm here!
Report when you're ready.
I'm here!
Report when you find the enemy.
I'll do it!
And then the second battle began.
I'm going!
Everybody back!
The class B courier made the first move and caught the guys off guard.
But Takayami answered him with a new move.
With a dark shadow.
And now the advantage goes from one team to another.
Poo laser!
Poo laser!
Poo laser!
Poo laser!
Poo laser!
Poo laser!
Here it is, Hagakure!
I see.
I'm gonna catch it now!
Don't go any further.
That's it! You can't run away!
I didn't think you'd attack me with just one support.
However, I'm always waiting for surprises.
Waiting for surprises?
Stop right there! Can't you stop?
What? Mushrooms?
I knew it.
Kenda is better than you.
Kenda was right.
If there's light, Kura-Ira's plan will fail.
Let's move on to Plan B.
I'll cover everything with mushrooms.
Phew! Now I can see my silhouette!
What a shame!
What a power of creation!
The whole earth is covered with mushrooms.
I don't see Kura-Ira. What if...
Yeah, Class B.
My little Ionomedotis is wrong.
Beautiful greenling.
Earthworm.
The spruce is gray.
Grow, grow!
Let the world be enchanted by mushrooms!
The Sea of Kinoko.
The hero's name is Devil Magus.
The miracle of mushrooms.
It releases mushroom spores from the body,
instantly grows mushrooms.
The more moisture, the faster and stronger the growth.
Damn, they grow on the bodies too.
Just like in the horror movie.
Her mushrooms disappear in two or three hours.
Nothing will remain of them.
That's why she scatters them like that.
The mushrooms are even on the camera.
Annoying!
According to Plan A,
Kura-Ira will fall into the dark shadow and suddenly attack.
Their team will definitely send a dark shadow to look for you.
Because it's effective and safe.
Most likely, they don't know that Kura-Ira has improved his magic and will capture the shadow.
Then you'll catch someone.
Easy to say.
Say!
What if it doesn't work out?
What will happen to us?
The enemy will definitely turn to the light to fight you.
And the rest will understand where you are.
Because of the light, the dark shadow will not do much.
Even if you can't handle it, we'll surround them and finish them off.
Plan A failed.
All that remains is to leave.
Let's move on to Plan B.
Help me, Kinoko!
They're growing and growing everywhere!
Oh my God!
The operation is in two stages.
They even predicted a fight with Kura-Ira.
I owe you, Kendo.
Guys, calm down!
We need to get together!
Bam-boom-bam-bam!
Here we go!
What?
Something's happening!
Today I'm on a horse.
Your bam-bam-bam went just fine.
My heart was pounding!
Fugidashi Manga from Class B.
The hero's name is Comix.
Three Miracles of Comix.
It can create sound effects and sound imitations from Comix in real life.
Depending on the sound, different effects are added.
Bam-bam-bam-bam!
What is this?
Where are you, Yaoi Rose?
My laser doesn't even have scratches on it.
Bam-bam-bam-bam!
What is this?
Bam-bam-bam?
Damn, it's a seducer!
There will be more mushrooms!
They're everywhere!
Yavitimka!
You're the worst!
The comers and Fugidashi saved the cura-ira from trouble.
The team attacks Class A one by one,
from a distance,
unrolling the enemy.
Here's the true power of Class B!
Go, you greedy commentators!
Go!
Two are attacking from both sides.
That's too much.
By the way, what will happen to the sounds of Fugidashi in another language?
I don't know.
Deku, look!
I separated Yaoi Rose from the rest of the team.
Really?
They were trying to do that from the start.
They separated me.
Why did they actually attack one by one?
We separated the brain.
Now I'll surpass you with my power!
The shield from Wolfram is so easy.
Itsuka Kendo!
The hero's name is a fighting fist!
The miracle is a fist!
Her fist becomes big!
The bigger it is, the more powerful its blow is!
I won't give you time to think.
Okay, let's compete in endurance.
Since you use the substance of your body for creation,
then you will definitely give up.
Don't stop.
That's what happened at the festival.
Don't give Yaoi Rose time to think.
Surpass with your power.
She created a good condition so quickly!
Right in the apple!
I said that she was smart, calm and quickly made a decision.
She was able to do it.
She was able to do it.
She was able to do it.
She was able to do it.
She was able to do it.
She was able to do it.
She was able to do it.
She was able to do it.
I feel like talking about an ornaments shop.
So far it's unclear if it's the right move.
If Yaoi Rose split them into Blue,
then they could have been an incorrect thought.
What a bet!
Yaoi Rose?
Are you making something up?
Even your plan didn't work, Todoroki.
How could my...
I don't care!
Just say it!
You had two votes in the election of the mayor.
One of them was mine.
Because I thought you were good in this business.
I came up with this, Todoroki.
I came up with something.
There will be a special operation.
To be honest, I've been thinking about it since the very beginning.
Since they were afraid of Yauya Rozova,
it was worth going after her in four.
And such predictions are quite expected for her.
Yauya Rozova, you're better than me in magic and in estimates.
And I don't like it when she puts us in one row.
Kendo, in fact, this is not true.
To be honest, in fact, I'm still an inexperienced fool.
And you still thought I was better.
So I won't let you see my destruction.
And since she expects this,
Chos can find a way to victory.
In this, Yauya Rozova is better.
Momo, did you work out so much?
It's time to show it.
Oh no!
A cannon!
It takes a lot of time to create such a big cannon.
The End
Kuro-Iroha is so invisible.
And I've lost sight of Hagakura.
Maybe it's worth meeting Yauya Rozova on the other side of the wall.
Or...
Don't stop thundering!
Mushrooms, mushrooms, mushrooms!
Damn mushrooms.
I'll have to slow down.
Hop!
Something in my throat dried up a little.
I'm sorry.
The End
Invisible!
Yauya Rozova has been separated.
At the same time, they are hiding themselves,
surrounding us and attacking us indirectly.
They are strong.
It's hard to fight them.
The mosquitoes.
Fukidashi.
Kuro-Iroha.
Kuro-Iroha.
We have to find out where they are.
Otherwise, it's over.
We have to figure out how to get out.
Oh no!
A cannon!
It takes a lot of time to create such a big cannon.
Hey!
She's going to die!
She obviously loves cannons.
Momo will really shoot her.
She's bluffing.
She wants to break through the wall of Fukidashi?
I'm sorry for scaring you.
It's dangerous!
I'll increase the fist.
At the moment of contact.
Double fist!
It's not for the wall.
She threw something.
When everything turned into a fight,
in which you are better,
I realized that I would hardly make it up.
But for the sake of our victory, I...
So that was the sound.
No, Fukidashi.
It's from the wall.
It's...
from Yaoi Rose?
Dark Shadow!
Now!
It's...
a mosquito.
What?
Speak louder.
I...
caught it.
Aoyama.
Great!
Well done, Kuroiru!
I'm waiting for you to catch the other two.
I was praised?
The enemy team doesn't know we're here.
So let's continue the mushroom attack.
Yeah.
Listen, mosquito.
What?
Don't you think
Class A knows about this place?
I have a thermal imager.
It's much easier to see with it.
When I look at the abyss,
the abyss looks at me in response.
A lucky bag?
What's in there?
Let me hold it.
Here?
Glasses?
And alcohol?
Is it for disinfection?
Look.
Judging by the design,
these glasses are for you.
They passed on her intentions without a word.
Guys, calm down.
We need to get together.
Yaoi Rose.
Rose.
Did you think about it back then?
Were you thinking about it?
Hey, hey.
Takayami went straight to the mosquito.
You have guests, too.
Oh!
I was wondering why the mushrooms didn't grow on you.
And you treated yourself, right?
Damn, where are you?
And I won't tell you!
When we find them, we'll be able to attack.
He's flying straight to us.
I won't let you run and hide.
A storm and a strike.
If you believe in a hawk,
speed wins power.
Black Fleece.
Inspiration.
A mushroom.
A mosquito.
He's too fast.
He won't make it.
We need to go back.
Are you looking for a shadow?
Here's my cape for you.
Listen.
I thought you wouldn't move, so you're not dangerous.
Fumikage, I caught her.
Wow.
Two at once.
We played well.
All thanks to the things from Yaoi Rose.
Yeah.
Hagakure also won.
So they can win three to one.
Dark Shadow.
Take them both to prison.
Fumikage?
I'm sorry.
He's so bad, so I took him away.
It would be a shame to use this mushroom on the verge of defeat.
Go in fear.
He's going easy.
Baby, are you an ordinary woodpecker?
In a close combat, a mosquito can do almost nothing.
But she scares.
You made a mistake.
So far you're learning from Takayami.
You should have knocked her out.
Take this!
I don't see you.
I don't understand what's going on.
We need to get rid of Fumikage and run to help the others.
I'm worried about Takayami and Yaoi Rose.
I'm invisible.
I'm invincible!
I'm sorry for the delay.
Kendo!
You saved me!
What's this?
I knocked her out, but I still got her.
She tied herself to me.
And she clung to the cannon.
It was very difficult to walk.
In all of her creations, I saw her.
I don't feel like I've won.
You saved me, mosquito.
Of course, we're partners.
Kendo, Fukidashi, how are you doing?
We survived the miracle.
Damn, Fumikage.
You used that mushroom.
Otherwise, we would have lost.
I understand.
Class A is a serious opponent.
We have to do it.
You're doing a B-class, Kendo!
Yaoi Rose, I hope you didn't fall into the trap.
I didn't fall into the trap.
Yaoi Rose, I hope you didn't fall into the trap.
It seems that Yaoi Rose has become a good leader.
I've seen so many different things, plus Ultra.
Now I feel good.
They were defeated.
But Takayami has a new technique.
Yaoi Rose fought and always thought ahead.
Everyone has definitely become better and stronger.
You took another step forward.
One more step towards the goal.
We're closer to the one we admire.
To the heroes.
The second fight.
Class B won a tie.
4-0.
Well done, Class B. Congratulations.
Yaoi Rose, scary comments.
Yaoi Rose!
Yaoi!
My congratulations!

In the next episode...
A and B class fights.
Now everyone has a victory and a defeat.
The speed of Ida and the ice and the flame of the road will surely help them to keep up.
Good luck, class.
Next, the third fight.
Hanenoki from class B brilliantly responded with flexibility.
