I live in a dormitory for the first time.
The second semester is coming to an end.
You don't want to sit either?
Listen, aren't you cold?
Very cold!
All our guys have already managed to modernize their costumes.
Ida, I'm amazed how you didn't get hot in this armor in the summer.
Even Kachan changed his clothes.
What are you doing there?
If you need something, tell me in person.
Hey, just look.
You're having fun as if you went on a picnic.
Get ready, class A!
Today we will decide who is stronger!
At the Heroic Faculty of UAE, joint classes between classes 1A and B are held.
And we are waiting for a battle.
And in this fight, there are participants who have not yet joined us.
Shinsa from the general faculty.
And so the first fight began.
And the class was in a rather difficult position.
And so the first fight began.

Burn the empty, dry heart

I guess some of you don't know
I'll explain how my miracle works, the control of the mind.
First, I have to focus on the goal, decide who I will control.
If after that the goal is answered to me, then the control is ready.
It will obey me.
It will move according to my instructions.
Shock can stop the action of the miracle.
I haven't tried, but I think you can't control several at once,
because the attention is concentrated.
Anyway, this is a powerful technique for those who have not seen it.
However, I cannot force a person to speak and order to think something too.
For example, I can say the goal and words, tsuyu asue, and order them to be written.
But I can't ask a question to give the name in response.
It's hard when everyone knows about your miracle.
Even though this is normal for us, they just won't answer you.
That's why I put this on.
It's like new voice compounds.
This mask creates a voice.
It allows you to change your voice.
It doesn't work if you speak in a microphone or megaphone.
There will already be your real voice.
Yes.
Thanks to a variety of echo and a set of records, the mask changes the tone of my voice.
And others hear it.
So...
So, the voice change?
It changes the voice.
Cool! Then you're not the winner!
The first match!
Let's go!
Oh, it's started!
We didn't come up with a plan, so let's just go!
The power of this device depends...
...on me.
Great!
Get out, Shishido!
I'm already running!
He spoke with my voice!
Very timely!
He copied my voice and took Shishido under control?
What a bastard!
He hasn't woken up yet!
A push!
Air prison!
Wake up, Shishido!
I told you to wake up!
Oh, that Shinsa!
Shock helps to get out of control.
That's what Shizaki and others who experienced it said.
But there is no word about the voice change.
Here, damn it!
Back!
If you touch me...
...you'll get a shock!
He got hit by the shock, but he didn't let go!
Shishido!
I got you!
Great! Take him to prison, Tsuya!
Tsuya!
Come on!
How can you still walk?
That Shishido from Class B...
...is strong as a beast.
Tsuya!
Everything's fine.
Class A...
...has him.
Kodo!
I don't think the wall is made of air.
It's very strong.
Oh, no.
Very strong.
Then...
...one more time!
Kirishima!
I'll take him to prison.
Yeah.
You can't get through.
You can't get through.
You can't get through.
My little ones.
Please, give me your strength.
Red glove!
Human mode.
Shishido Jurota.
A beast of a miracle.
It amplifies physical indicators...
...and then it becomes normal again.
The beast is here again.
Of all of you, only Kirishima...
...is capable of fighting me.
Right?
Well, then...
What's going on?
The lost angel falls from the sky.
Kirishima has been caught.
Yeah.
Asui caught Tsuburamo.
So it's a draw.
Yeah.
Damn it.
I can't open my mouth.
What kind of power is this?
I've eaten you up.
I understand everything.
But Kodo is very resistant.
He will only interfere in the fight.
For now, I'll retreat.
It's better to get a score of 2 to 1...
...and guarantee victory.
Now the score is 2 to 1.
Sorry, Kodo.
I was caught, but there...
...was her tongue.
Now the prison is much stronger...
...than when at the sports festival.
Class B has become stronger.
So they were working on their own tricks.
The teams are gradually eliminating each other.
Shishida and Tsuburamo immediately resisted.
Each team has the same number of people...
...but Class B has a better attitude.
Will my students be able...
...to break the class with their fierce attack?
Yes, that's how to keep the teacher.
That was a passionate comment.
This Shishida is incredibly strong.
His smell is a serious thing.
After all, your inexperience is obvious, Shinsuo.
That's his technique.
He turned when he saw the enemy.
He won't be able to keep up with the speed of the fight.
If they don't want to deal with Shinsuo, they have to...
What are we going to do?
We're going to lose like this.
We've been dealing with Shinsuo for too long.
We've been caught off guard.
I should have acted faster to catch them.
I'm sorry.
We should be sorry.
You had to fight in the middle of the fight.
I was counting on myself.
You know, you did well...
...because you were able to move after such a blow.
And I had to save myself.
I even praised him by accident.
Yes, you said you weren't looking for friends here.
But you're really cool.
You're definitely going to be a hero.
It doesn't matter.
Our plan is more important.
I've come up with something.
Kaminari, check your pointer.
What?
The pointer?
I became a bait for ambush?
Oh, what a sinful deed from your side.
You'll get a rose later.
A rose?
It ended well.
If we catch two of them and the other three, we'll win the class.
Now we know about Shinsuo's trick.
We'll get rid of the guy...
...and we'll be able to keep Kaminari out and still get the upper hand.
Shinsuo...
...we've lost Tsuburaba.
What?
What's going on, Shishido?
I don't know yet.
But I'm sure...
...three Asuas are coming to us.
Three?
They came up with a plan considering Shishido's smell?
Then...
...I'll teach them a lesson.
Such an idea...
...will lead to a disaster.
Shishido and Kaminari
Three Asuas are coming to us.
What did he say?
After all, she's a nectoplasm.
Maybe there's only one Asu.
Midori, is that the one?
Yeah, but...
I heard about it, but I didn't see her use it.
I'll tell you about my magic.
I can jump high,
hold on to the walls and stretch my tongue...
...up to 20 meters.
I can also turn my stomach out...
...to wash it...
...and get rid of the poisonous slime.
Although, in fact, it just burns a little.
Poisonous slime!
She covered her guys...
...to get rid of the smell.
We almost forgot about it.
And Class B has nothing to remember.
Kaminari, check your pointer.
What?
The pointer?
During your fight, one of them got into Shishido.
The pointers stay where they fall.
With the help of the glasses, you can always find out where they are.
You're so attentive, Tsuyo!
That's amazing that you didn't notice it yourself, Kaminari.
Shishido always finds people for sure.
I have a very strong sense of smell.
It's good to start with the fact that he always knows where we are.
Are we going to use that?
Three of them smell like Tsuyo.
He won't know who's where until he sees them.
It looks like he didn't notice the pointer either.
And he's not moving anywhere.
The question is, where are the others?
Where are they?
Don't think about it.
We'd better deal with Shishido.
There's the smell and the power.
By the way, Tsuyo, how are you?
I got it recently.
I was able to land normally.
But I can't win in close combat now.
With my true name in my eyes,
I will punish the intrigants.
Via Dolorosa.
Show me where they are, the beast of Apocalypse.
At 10, 12, and 2 o'clock,
they are distracted and come here.
And I'm not the beast of Apocalypse.
I'm the beast of Zhivodan.
If all three of them are here,
then they know where we are.
Who can track them down in their team?
Listen, the beast of Apocalypse.
What's that on you?
It's the Kaminaria thing.
I caught one.
I'll pull them out.
We don't know who's there.
Back, Shishido!
What if it's the Kaminaria?
I guessed it!
You pulled out the short one.
Now you three
will get the order.
Faith Shield!
The layers of the lava
stopped the electric discharge.
Even if something goes wrong,
it will affect the shield.
It will withstand everything.
I was just kidding.
When I'm 10 meters from the pointer,
my electric discharge
will stop the electric discharge.
What?
I barely made it.
Rin Hiryu.
A monster of scales.
It creates solid scales
around the whole body.
It can shoot at them
or use them as armor.
It's a monster of scales.
A monster of scales.
It can shoot at them
or use them as armor.
It's a monster of scales.
It can shoot at them
Are you going to shoot them or make them armor?
Next!
Hurry up! Recover Azu!
Yes.
Shishido, where are they?
Hey!
It's not me, I said!
This is a change of voice of Shinsu!
Come on!
Seriously?
Laza?
Shazaki is also here.
You can't hit her.
We retreat.
Ah, stop!
I came up with something!
What if they catch only me?
Catch?
If they get tense because of me,
they'll pull out a short straw.
At the sports festival,
it took a ton of her lazas against my orders.
If she focuses on me,
then there will be less lazas.
Then you, Shinsa and Tsuyu,
will get a chance to get closer.
It's not that I looked from above,
but I saw that experience matters.
So, here's the hero's course.
I don't understand where the voice came from.
He used the echo in the building.
Shishido, where's the enemy?
Is someone on the other side?
Hey, answer me!
Beast, you'd better look at the people.
Are their lips moving?
Okay, let's wake up Shazaki first.
Your scales won't get here.
Asui!
You're really good at jumping.
Shishido, Asui is there!
That's how we communicate.
Judging by the movement of the smell,
it was Asui.
So, this smell
is definitely coming from Shinsa.
Shinsa
is receiving
Shinsa.
So, you're behind.
You're a terrible fighter.
You've already become a worthy threat.
You're good.
I won't buy it.
Yes!
Straight from the washing machine.
Worn out cloth.
There you go.
However,
the villains are not so weak
that they can be easily defeated.
Behind!
I told you!
Behind!
Beast of Apocalypse!
I won't let you wash my brains again!
Beast of Apocalypse?
Turn around!
I'm sorry.
Hurray!
Yes, you did great.
Wow, Shinsa is good.
He didn't even bother much.
No, he acted like that.
Thanks to Asui and Kaminaria's quick thinking.
Cool.
Asui got rid of their smell.
Then he couldn't find them.
Then he took advantage of the change of voice.
Then the opponents stopped communicating.
Thanks to decent training,
his presence was enough to control the area.
Control of the mind.
More problematic than I expected.
With the change of voice and the woven cloth,
he's not like in our festival battle.
Shinsa was training all this time,
but we didn't know.
We don't choose our wishes.
For my dream to come true.
To become a hero.
Shazaki!
Shazaki!
Shazaki!
Why am I in prison?
Why did they control me?
Lord, have mercy on me.
Forgive this lost soul.
Shazaki!
Come to yourself, Shazaki!
You're already far ahead of me,
but I want to catch up with you.
You're not behind us.
You're very strong, Shinsa.
I still have a long way to go.
I have to learn how to handle it myself.
I'll become stronger and beat the professionals myself.
I'll beat the professionals myself.
In the first battle,
the class wins!
Shinsa is in the team!

The second match of Class A and B. Class B has learned from the mistakes of the guys from the first fight. They have developed a plan in the center of which Kendo has been built. Will Takayami's dark shadow be able to change the current situation of Class A?
Next, the operation of new techniques. New forces of Takayami will be revealed for the first time in Japan. Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
