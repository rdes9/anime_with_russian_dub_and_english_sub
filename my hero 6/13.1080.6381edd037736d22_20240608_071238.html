        <pre>It was the beginning of a tragedy.
We had no idea what was going on,
and the seeds of destruction had already begun to sprout.
TO BE CONTINUED
The song is about a man who wants to be a hero, but he can't be a hero because he can't be a hero because he can't be a hero because he can't be a hero because he can't be a hero because he can't be a hero because he can't be a hero because he can't be a hero because he can't be a hero because he can't be a hero because he can't be a hero because he can't be a hero because he can't be a hero because he can't be a hero because he can't be a hero because he can't be a hero because he can't be a hero because he can't be a hero because he can't be a hero because he can't be a hero because he can't be a hero because he can't be a hero because he can't be a hero because he can't be a hero because he can't be a hero because he can't be a hero because he can't be a hero because he can't be a hero because he can't be a hero because he can't be a hero
she
I didn't have enough decisiveness
You're such a moron.
Of course not!
Flaming Waves!
The work on the level is in half an hour after getting the license.
Today we have two students on the show who were forced by the villains to step back.
Please welcome Todoroki Shota and Bakugo Katsuki from Class 1A of the Heroic Faculty.
Tell me, do you usually like to study together?
Why, does it look like that?
You should go to the cocculist.
We're friends.
What?
Don't be silly.
How long have we been friends?
We spent time together on the courses.
And what kind of system is that?
Time spent together doesn't make us friends.
What do you mean, system?
No idea!
You too, it's time for you to think!
It was the end of December.
There were a few days left until the end of the semester.
Tell me, do you usually like to study together?
We're friends.
Aren't you scared?
No, I acted calmly, just like I was taught.
Now it's Todoroki's turn.
The interview took an hour.
And Bakugo didn't give a single answer.
Only a piece of his head.
My answer!
That's how they defended him.
That was the third interview.
He got a license and earned himself fame.
Newly appointed, but reliable heroes.
I hope they'll be able to work as professionals soon.
So that the tragedy in Deku doesn't happen again.
Nine days have passed since the incident.
There were only 20 people in the riot.
It destroyed the city of Deku in 50 minutes.
They say it's still worse than Kamino.
It's a little crowded and less victims.
Maybe the criminals made it worse
to make people's opinions about the heroes worse.
Let's listen to them.
It's stupid to blame Deku for the heroes.
They should reconsider their system.
Reset the production business?
That's what they say only after.
Let the heroes work harder.
We're trying, and you're trying too.
Let's ask our commentator Kuroishiso's opinion.
Earlier, after so many destructions,
everyone around started blaming the heroes.
But now, as it seems to me,
we're in a critical position.
The Cores are gradually turning into support.
After that guy, look,
people started looking at things differently.
Look!
He's risking his life to save us!
And that's all thanks to the hard work of the hard workers!
Don't be too happy.
Maybe something's gotten better.
But behind the scenes,
there's an extraordinary situation.
It seems to me that when you support those
who will definitely win,
you pray for their victory.
Recently, the heroes were a show business.
And people are waiting for true heroes.
The Cores?
We've invited her for a consultation.
Since you're now more often in front of everyone.
The full night has also come.
I'm actually not at all in sight.
Next time, it will definitely work out.
Not for me to say, of course.
But she's a model of show business here.
Come on, shut up.
We will learn to communicate with the media.
I, the Cores, am an active hero.
With high demand.
I will teach you how to behave as a hero.
I can't imagine what will happen.
But let's arrange a full plus ultra, people!
Yes!
Today we will be working on a hero's interview.
Nonsense.
Hero Shota, come here.
Okay.
You've shown yourself great, Shota.
What are you talking about?
Pretend that you're from the mission.
Come on.
Okay.
Shota, tell me.
What kind of hero do you want to become?
So that when I appear, everyone becomes calm.
How great!
If such a handsome came to save me,
I would have a heart attack.
What do you have?
Heart problems?
What is he talking about?
Charm.
Give me two.
And what are your best tricks?
Sand particles.
Cutting an ice wall.
Covering a large area
and preventing the enemy.
It has a lot of applications.
And I have a harder burst of flame waves.
What?
He's talking about that technique during class B training?
Well, it was a hard-workers teacher.
A fist of fire.
The Fist of Fire is my dad's technique.
The Fist of Fire! The Fist of Fire!
I'm not there yet.
I will strive for more.
I'm not here to discuss personal problems.
But if you want to calm down,
learn to smile.
If you smile, you'll beat them all.
I'll smile and kill them?
That's enough!
Do we have to show the techniques for the interview?
Oh, my dear students of U.A.
In fact, not everyone knows who you are.
Your best techniques make you look good.
Show people what you're capable of.
The hero is constantly shouting out the names of his techniques.
Thanks to this, they are coordinated with others.
They warn of the villains and people trust them with their lives.
Her head was only occupied with thoughts about how she looks on camera.
It's not just the mountain lady.
Now, all the heroes are going after themselves.
Hero number one.
So, let's continue our interview.
I chose the hero with the name Ingenium
to continue my brother's business.
I'm full of regret for you.
I'm creative.
After all, I have encyclopedic knowledge.
I have confidence in people.
I'm Ura Viti.
A miracle of weightlessness.
For me, everything in the world weighs nothing.
You have to be soft, too.
The hero is in the Tsukuyomi area.
There is no glory in who did not recognize the darkness.
Oh, what an atmosphere!
The strong hero is the red bandit.
There is no blood behind me.
Oh, come on!
I'll dissolve everything. I'm Pinky.
I'm the hero of the electric shocker charge.
I'll break everything with current.
What are you doing?
I'm not worried about you.
But you're better than I thought.
And I refuse to carry such nonsense.
Shut up and let's go already.
In the interview where you are alone, everything is not so bad.
I understand.
You just don't agree with all humanity.
I'm sorry, Pakuga.
You were cut out because of me.
Who did you doubt yourself?
As if someone like you can influence me.
I see.
Maybe it's better to teach Pakuga how to avoid darkness
than you do, Aizawa.
No.
Now he has to learn from someone else.
I think you're Deku.
I saw you in the business.
That's great.
I'm so glad.
What do you think about what happened?
I'm glad.
How did he manage to learn my statement?
It seems to be from the nerves.
By the way, he rarely participates in something like that.
Many of your techniques are based on the techniques of the Almighty.
Do you admire them?
Yes.
What a voice.
However, I don't just want to copy it.
I worked out the techniques so that they would suit me.
For example, the Delaver Strike.
I chose a staff that the Almighty had not yet used
to name the techniques.
And then I turned on a part of another technique, Air Power.
By the way, he broke down on the bottom.
The guy clearly has made progress.
But how does he feel?
A miracle is not connected with strength.
A new ability is one for all.
And the truth did not wake up.
There is no more presence.
Two weeks have passed.
I imagined everything in my head every day.
She did not disappear.
That man told me to figure it out in this style.
That she was waiting for me.
I locked the miracle, but she is there.
And once I locked on to her,
I decide when to use this power.
I learned to hold her back.
Now I will learn to control her,
as once one for all.
I will free a small percentage,
which I can cope with.
It worked!
Yes, the construction is small, but this is the first step.
Once she ...
And what was it?
Do not be happy about such nonsense.
Did not go to bed again?
Director.
Insomnia is harmful to the wool.
What? I fell asleep.
Do not worry about me.
You did not understand the meaning of the word sufferer.
There are not so many records about the past.
Did you want something?
I have an announcement.
Very soon we will resume the internship.
Internship at the heroes?
What is it?
What if we come back after such an internship?
Director, do you have your chair?
Yes, but it is best to warm up here.
Initially, we decided to stop the internship
after talking to the agencies.
We wanted to see what would happen.
It seems that this time the security commission
requires that the entire heroes of the team
be sent to the hospital.
Do they think that there are not enough heroes?
When in fact there are a lot of them.
It says here that it is necessary to be able to work
with the increased level of villains.
This is clearly connected with the case of Deiko.
The League is involved here.
Apparently, they are not just hiding.
This time, the security commission
requires that the entire Heroic Faculty intern.
Requires?
Apparently, they are not just hiding.
Most likely, the commission found out
about some serious trouble.
And since they do not declare public,
and they also speak in a hazy way,
then they are trying to hide their actions.
Kayama is right.
Their order to resume the internship
feels like a kind of message.
They cannot declare the desire to employ schoolchildren.
This is unthinkable.
This has never happened before.
Nevertheless, the threatening danger is the norm for the heroes.
Let's turn to the heroes with good achievements.
It will be a winter vacation task.
Tell the students after the meeting.
Okay.
Aizawa, I would like to discuss
another program from the commission.
U.A. has been in the dormitory for several months now.
No one has raised any suspicions.
So, you think there is no spy from the League of Villains?
Let's see.
If the League of Villains makes a move
and nothing happens, then...
Director,
everyone who studies at the Heroic Faculty
has a hero's heart.
Yes, I know.
By the way, are you coming back today?
It's going to be a problem.
What about Midori?
Guys, you've earned it
and forgot what day it is today.
All together!
Happy Birthday!
We are being sent to the internship.
I think we are the most busy first-year students in history.
Will you both come back?
Yes.
What about you, Jiro?
Happy Birthday!
Midori, where are you going?
Since you came out with the Night Eye Agency...
Now they are in charge of a lot of things.
What are you going to do?
I don't know.
Now they are in charge of a lot of things.
Will you be able to see him again?
Yes, I thought about it myself.
Oh, Midori, I'm sorry.
I'm ashamed to admit it,
but we don't have time at all.
Deco, we haven't seen each other for a long time.
Sir used to do everything himself.
It's terribly difficult to continue his business.
I also practiced at the Grand Arena,
but he also couldn't.
I don't understand anything.
What do you mean?
Well, that time we did what we wanted,
and now it's a must.
So they will give me someone.
Why did you open it?
So it turns out...
Bakugo, are you going to the best jinso?
What?
I haven't decided yet.
Bakugo, you didn't choose the hero's name?
They rejected everything so that I wouldn't propose.
Oh, and what did you propose?
A deadly explosion!
Explosive murder!
Explosive murder!
It's like a kindergarten.
This is a desire.
The hero's name reflects what you want to become.
You are still looking only at yourself,
and I want to show you the world around you.
You will become an old woman,
you will get a license,
and then come back.
And I will ask you again about your hero's name.
You seem to be called by a bunch of people.
After the sports festival.
You can go wherever you want.
Now I'm not interested in learning from the scum.
Don't you dare put it on!
Come on.
Give in to the influence of the smugglers.
The internship is waiting for us.
People, it's a holy night!
Enough talking about school affairs!
I didn't expect this from you.
Okay, that's enough.
Mineta is also right.
Let's better eat!
Does Sakharov know how to cook regular food?
I'm late.
Have you already started here?
Candies?
Or life?
No, it's not that holiday.
Santa Eri!
What a beauty!
It suits you very well!
Go away, demons!
Go away!
No, this one was two months ago.
Togada also came?
He is now with his class.
Come on, go have fun.
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
Come on, go have fun.
Soft and cute!
I painted the eggs.
So we have Easter!
Eri, do you want to pour something?
Yes!
It seems that her rock is growing again.
Yes.
She is happy.
She took it seriously to your words.
What a beauty!
It suits you very well!
What a beauty!
It suits you very well!
What a beauty!
It suits you very well!
What a beauty!
It suits you very well!
What a beauty!
It suits you very well!
What a beauty!
It suits you very well!
What a beauty!
It suits you very well!
What a beauty!
It suits you very well!
What a beauty!
It suits you very well!
What a beauty!
It suits you very well!
What a beauty!
It suits you very well!
What a beauty!
It suits you very well!
What a beauty!
It suits you very well!
What a beauty!
It suits you very well!
Happy Holidays!
At that moment I didn't know anything.
I thought that I would like such a Christmas
and in the next year
I sincerely wished for this
I was looking at the world
without a sound
I don't even know the tears that have spilled
It's okay
I don't like the words
I suddenly mutter
So I can't say anything
I want to believe in the future of the dark sky
The longing is not something to kill myself
I have to say goodbye
I shout to myself
Why?
I'm looking for an answer even if I get hurt
Goodbye, let's meet again someday
I wish to meet you
I shout to myself
Why?
I'm looking for an answer even if I get hurt
Goodbye, let's meet again someday
I wish to meet you
I shout to myself
Why?
I'm looking for an answer even if I get hurt
Midoriya, Bakuga
If you don't have any options
then maybe you can do an internship
with the hero number one, Storatel
In the next episode
Kachan and I agreed on the suggestion of Todoroki
to do an internship with Storatel
This is your chance
Midoriya Izuku
What heroic deeds does the hero number one do?
Remember everything well
and use this experience for development
Next, the agency of Storatel
Storatel's fire will burn the villains to the ground
Go beyond, plus Ultra
