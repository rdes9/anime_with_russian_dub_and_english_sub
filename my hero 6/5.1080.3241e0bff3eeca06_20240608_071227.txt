Heroic faculty of UA. Classes 1A and 1B are having a joint combat training.
In the first fight, Shinsu's miracle successfully hindered Class B's team work and defeated Class A.
Can you time me on your mind in the shallower and m√°ximo of time like goodness and happiness?
It looks like the enjoyer came up with that piece of shit!
Because of Silicon Valley yeah, I'm more connected with Silicon Valley and raised, but otherwise it's not the most convenient to fight with children.
What did you learn and what would you change?
My magic is only useful during interviews with the enemy.
If everything were true, I would have died when Shazaki caught me.
You have to learn to give animals more accurate orders.
And I did a great job, right? Now you love me?
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
What did you do here? Now you love me?
Everything is fine. Love can be controlled.
Come on, express it.
I would not have lost Kodo and Kirishima the next time.
I would like to win without losing anyone.
We were wrong.
Wrapped fabric.
I could not apply my knowledge at all.
It's so sad.
If it could be done at once, you would not have worked.
It took me six years.
And your disappointment will help the development.
Yes.
Those who went to practice are now at a disadvantage.
Well, that's logical.
They remember eight vows.
They say that that fight was harsh.
If you go through something like that, then the attitude towards training and motivation will be different.
Compared to this, his unreasonable actions are much wilder.
So, Kirishima, focus on training the skills of close combat.
Yes!
Kodo made the right conclusion.
Work on the accuracy of the animal's instructions.
Don't get carried away. Think about the weaknesses of the enemy.
Kaminari, you took it seriously.
Where is the recognition of someone's strength to beat their friends?
Got it.
Asui, think about how to fix the mistake, not about the mistake itself.
Kiro!
Use today's experience in the future.
Free!
Got it!
He won, but he saw his inexperience and now it hurts him.
However, he was not upset.
Shinsa is preparing for the next fight, spinning the fight in the head and looking for a way out.
God, he didn't grow up so great.
Well, you know, you lost.
You know why, right?
They made a shishido with a central figure.
They decided to use Shazaki.
If they acted now, they could win.
The look on Vlad's face is terrifying.
Shazaki can't lie.
This factor got you, right? Shishido.
Monomo.
Because of this, we gave the enemy time to prepare.
Sorry, Shazaki.
The flame of hell burned down.
Well, you at least showed me something good.
I'm really looking forward to our fight.
Hey, Shinsou!
Let's come up with a way to make the class cry.
Something to shut them up for the belt.
He speaks for himself.
We also need to come up with a plan.
Let's discuss what can be done right now.
Come on.
Let's do a combo with a powerful finish.
We'll think about the plan too.
There will be a road in the center.
Yeah.
Good idea.
Bakugo, let's think too.
Get out, you freaks.
You will only get in my way.
There you go.
In the fifth fight, we will be against Shinsou.
His voice change is dangerous.
Sticky acid flying blow.
What's this?
It's easy to hide here.
It will be hard to find the enemy.
I can handle it.
This is mine.
Made for me and for me.
We will use Ida at the right time.
First, I will tell you something about my miracle.
Instant kill.
What's this?
If someone is injured, go to the medical center.
People are low creatures.
Don't replace their parts.
Yeah, that's it.
Oh my God.
Oh, this is youth.
Spring in life.
Actually, it's winter now.
The year is coming to an end.
All the guys worked hard on their miracles.
And the best techniques.
Midori also started to use one for all.
He studied the side style.
And the power of the air.
There was also an exam for the license.
The battle with the vows of death.
The festival.
Deeper than all these events and troubles.
They were constantly developing.
Now they have the opportunity to compare themselves with others.
To understand their current situation.
This lesson looks like a genius rehearsal.
All-powerful.
What do you say, Shashinsa?
He is good.
Not a rough ten.
What he experienced at first.
Disappointment.
Great.
This can be considered an exam to transfer to the Heroic Faculty.
Duman with impatience is waiting for the next fight.
Well, Vlad, let's continue?
If so.
Get ready for the second fight!
Yaoi Rose.
What is it, Kenda?
Why didn't you take part in the beauty contest?
I was sure you would take part.
Aizawa did not warn me that the contest would be held.
And I had a lesson and I still could not come.
Probably Aizawa decided that it was not necessary for me to participate.
In practice, we were shooting together in advertising.
In some sense, we were placed in one category.
Fans throw us in the same pile.
Really?
As when someone likes all the idols inside the same group.
At the festival, the same people shouted the same thing.
Yaoi Rose and Kenda.
Yes.
Ah, that's right.
Idols.
Full stars.
Well, actually ...
Yaoi Rose, you are better than me in magic and ratings.
I don't like it when we are placed in one row.
In fact, I was waiting for the opportunity to fight as it should be.
From the bottom of my heart, I accept the challenge.
Takayami.
You and I are in the same field of berries.
Kuroi Roshihai.
You merge your magic with any darkness and move into it.
Right?
You and I have a common purpose.
Right?
Another lover of philosophy.
Life is an endless darkness.
These guys don't shine at all.
So, both teams are ready.
Then ...
Good luck, Kendo team!
Let's start the second fight!
Come on, passionate comments!
Come on!
Well ...
It's a deal!
Yeah!
What role does Kenda play in Class B?
She takes and does what she needs!
How loud!
After all, she is an old woman!
A smart girl, calm and quick to make decisions.
Also, Kenda is brave when she has to risk herself in the front line.
And her joy of life unites our class!
Without her, everyone in Class B would have already captured the power!
Hey, don't do that!
Older sister of Class B!
Here is a girl named Itsuka Kendo!
I wonder if the operation will work?
What operation?
Please go to the intelligence, Takayami!
Takayami-san!
I got it!
Dark shadow!
I'm here!
Report when you find the enemy!
I got it!
We are more or less familiar with each other's secrets.
But we have been improving them all this time.
We may not know something.
Therefore, for the first time ...
We need to wait and watch!
Dark shadow found the enemy!
Right under that pipe!
Let's go!
We will not wait for anything!
I'll deal with them right away!
Help!
Kura-Ira!
I'm going!
Did you learn to let go of the dark shadow at a great distance?
Did you also become stronger in practice?
How to say?
The further the dark shadow, the less the miracle lasts.
Oh, look, he's back!
Everyone back!
Takayami!
What is it?
What's going on?
Fumikage!
He caught me!
What's wrong with the dark shadow?
Did you burst again?
No.
It's not so dark that Takayami has lost control.
Maybe someone else is controlling him?
Someone from Class B?
Wait!
Hagakure!
Make light!
Now!
Light break!
Say cheese!
Come back!
Dark shadow!
Kura-Ira was inside him!
He's gone!
He's merged with the shadows!
So, who is Kura-Ira?
Kura-Ira Shihai from Class B!
The miracle of darkness!
He's able to merge with the shadows!
And when he developed the miracle stronger, he learned to walk in the shadows!
However, they also have to move!
Takayami Fumikage!
I defeated you!
You and I have the same purpose!
I see.
So we're rivals.
I'm going!
I'll start with the technique I created when I was with Yastri.
Dark Falling Angel.
Falling Angel?
Yes.
Dark Falling Angel.
He always did everything himself.
Not synthetic, natural diamonds!
For such a bunch, it's easy to get three hundred...
Yes, I'll figure it out.
Yastri!
Well, you're slow.
Well, you're slow.
Well, you're slow.
Well, you're slow.
Well, you're slow.
Well, you're slow.
There's a bar nearby with customers.
I'm going there now.
So fill the papers yourself!
Tsukiyomi!
We're partners.
We'll deal with him.
Yastri is too fast.
On the other hand, he's the most efficient.
I'll go.
Tsukiyomi!
He's a desperate guy.
It was the first time after the sports festival when Yastri called me.
In practice, I was constantly chasing him,
cleaning up the places where he figured out the situation.
And there were questions.
You can't sit and wait for the situation to get worse.
Then why did you ask to take me?
We're birds of the same flight.
Is this a game of words?
I'm serious.
20 percent.
I'm here partially for a conversation with a class 1 student.
I would like to discuss those guys from the league of villains.
And since you're going,
I decided to take someone who can sing along with me.
I chose one of the best at the sports festival.
I stopped at a bird-like place.
You seemed to me worthy.
First of all, tell me about the attack on ZNK.
Then I told him in more detail about the attack.
With every word, the ambush grew.
I'm not a singer to you.
The practice went well, and I didn't learn anything.
Hey, tell me how it was in Kyusyu.
There...
It was okay.
Later.
He took me to practice again.
During the breaks between these lessons,
something happened to him.
You called me for the sake of stories?
I'm a bird.
There's nothing to look at from above.
I'm the third.
Or rather, hero number two.
This Tsukuyomi has gone crazy.
He's capable of a lot.
Oh!
Great job!
Tsukuyomi, can I have you?
What do you want to talk about this time?
I'm talking about something else.
I'm a bird!
We've become the wind!
Is this your first time flying?
20% of us are here because we're birds of one flight.
50% for the sake of Oligia's stories.
And the last 30% are connected to the fact that
it seemed to me that you were wasting yourself in the void.
The sky is great.
You look from the bird's height.
I'm wasting myself in the void?
I'm not a bird.
I'm wasting myself in the void?
It's good to work on your weaknesses.
However, don't forget to develop your strengths.
You can move more freely.
I'm not interested in raising the next generation.
But we're birds of one flight.
The ones who can fly should fly.
There's no need to limit yourself to the Earth.
I'll start with the technique that I created
when I was with Yastribo.
Dark Pudge Angel.
Dark Pudge Angel?
It's curious.
Show me!
He's moving in the shadows!
Single attack again.
How unexpected!
Will they repeat the first fight?
Double deception?
It's worse that there are so many corpses here
and you can't find him for them.
Takayami, are you holding on?
Yes.
Takayami Fumikage.
I'll beat you.
He needs me.
So you think, Class A?
We have a common purpose.
I've set an emotional trap
before the start of the fight.
I need Takayami Fumikage.
Or rather, you decide.
And this is not true.
The insidious hero Vantabrak.
Now you'll see how I act.
Aoyama?
Insidiousness.
So despicable.
I beg you,
change the meaning of your actions.
With my speed.
And in such a crowded, difficult place,
a dark shadow is connected to that dump.
It's harder for him to move here,
which means they will never catch me.
That's what you thought.
Dark shadow.
Dark Pudge Angel.
Is he flying?
Does Takayami have a new technique?
How can he fly?
The principle is very simple.
The dark shadow always soars.
He can move and hold Takayami.
He wraps the cloak so that the light does not hit.
After all, this is his weakness.
And he acts at high power.
In this case, Takayami's hands are free.
And the dark shadow flies.
It is so obvious that we did not think.
And he works with it.
Just like the egg of Columbus.
Cool.
You're great, Takayami.
However, do not forget to develop strong sides.
Thank you.
I'm going.
I will achieve even more.
Rendezvous, Rendezvous.
The plan failed.
Aoyama.
Laser in the butt.
Takayami.
Fly as high as possible.
Dark shadow.
Put on the cloak.
Now.
I will change the shape of the shadow.
Laser in the butt.
Here he is, Hagakure.
I see.
I'll catch it now.
Do not step further.
That's it.
Do not run away.
I did not think you would attack from support alone.
However, I personally always
always
expect surprises.
You expect surprises?
Stop!
What?
Can you stop?
What?
Are these mushrooms?
I knew it.
After all, Kenda is better than you.
Kenda was right.
If there is light,
the plan of Kuroi will fail.
Let's move on to Plan B.
I will cover everything around with mushrooms.
I will cover everything around with mushrooms.
I will cover everything around with mushrooms.
I will cover everything around with mushrooms.
I will cover everything around with mushrooms.
I will cover everything around with mushrooms.

I will cover everything around with mushrooms.
I will cover everything around with mushrooms.
I will cover everything around with mushrooms.
I will cover everything around with mushrooms.
I will cover everything around with mushrooms.
I will cover everything around with mushrooms.
I hope we get up one more time,
Hope we get together the next time!
What will the team do?
Next! Predictions!
Yaoi Rose predicts the course of the fight and creates what is necessary for the victory!
Go beyond the limits, plus Ultra!
