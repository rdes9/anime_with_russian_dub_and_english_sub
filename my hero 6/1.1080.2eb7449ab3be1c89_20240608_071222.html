Thewentyer was just incredible yesterday.
Yes,
although I got scared to hell when I fought him again.
I'm sorry, but isn't this hero much stronger than him?
Poor guy.
And you too?
You know how to fight, don't you?
I know how to fight.
I know how to fight.
I know how to fight.
And you too?
You know how to fight, don't you?
You know how to fight.
Don't compare us.
For some time I couldn't move.
Now I'll move my body forward.
In the style of fire.
Only my faith does not cause much damage.
But I'm pretty fast.
I separated several branches in advance.
Let's add my speed to your firepower.
Come on.
I'll push you up.
Number one!
You are created.
You.
It's me.
I'm from the past.
Or from another future.
Burn.
And rest forever.
Plus Ultra!
Plus Ultra!
Total destruction!
Total destruction!
At the end.
He was proud and victorious.
Super powerful!
He's number one.
The hawk is also amazing.
And handsome.
They think he's too fast for nothing.
Todoroki.
How's the caretaker?
Well, it looks like the condition is not too serious.
I see.
Thank God.
You can be proud of your father, Todoroki.
Yes, I can.
Hey.
The phone has been ringing for a long time.
Okay.
Stop fooling around.
Remember who you are.
As long as you have a temporary license.
But you still have a certificate
and responsibility.
So behave like a hero.
Although two of you
are still going for extra.
From now on we will rise to a higher level.
So get ready.
So.
Today at the class hour.
Education alarm.
Education alarm.
Theoretical villains have invaded the U.A.
The heroes of Class 1A
must arrive on the spot.

Please change and come as soon as possible.
Please change and come as soon as possible.
The class of the heroes 1A,
let's get to work.
Yes.
About 80% of the world's population
has reassurances.
They are super people
and their special ability is that.
To fight the villains
The hero's profession was created by the people who turn this force into evil.
I, Midoriya Itsuko, have always dreamed of becoming a hero and entered the Heroic Faculty of the Ioi Academy,
where I am going to meet my dream.
Here I found friends who share my goal.
Together we overcome any difficulties and save people with smiles.
We do everything to become the strongest heroes.
Yes, here it is. My Heroic Academy.
The Heroic Faculty of the Ioi Academy
The Heroic Faculty of the Ioi Academy

The villains have invaded the Beta area.
So far, only this is known.
Let this be a lesson. We will put all our strength into this task.
First, we need to understand the situation of the case.
It's up to you, the reconnaissance team.
We will do everything.
Kitsue, please look for the destroyed places.
Koda Koji, the hero of the animal type Anima, the miracle of the voice of animals.
Kyo Kajiro, the hero of the hearing type.
The miracle of the ear holes.
North-East, about 900 meters.
There are sounds of destruction.
I see smoke from the explosions in the specified place.
Shoji Mezo, the hero of the tentacles.
The miracle of the hands of the replicants.
There is a building that has fallen next to the river.
And it looks like it's burning.
There are no villains.
Roger that.
First, we need to figure out the fire.
I understand everything.
Yaoi Rose Momo, the hero of the Universal Creative.
The miracle of creation.
There is no time.
Quickly assemble a fire squad and move out.
Engenium.
Shota.
I got it.
I'm with you.
Me too.
Me too.
Bad news.
Someone was carried away by the river.
What?
Now it's our turn.
Grape juice.
Yeah.
Great.
The rescue squad is also moving out.
Engenium.
Appears.
And Totenya.
Turbo hero Engenium.
The miracle of the engine.
We're going too.
Yeah.
Momo, are you not going?
Where are you dragging me?
Looking for villains.
Let the rescue do the hard work.
What?
Shota, we need help.
Now.
Totoroki Shota.
Heroic name Shota.
The miracle of ice and flame.
Great.
It's time for us to shine.
Is that all?
What's wrong with the man in trouble?
I found him.
Where is he, Froppy?
There.
I don't know why, but I was washed away.
There is Toga.
What is he doing there?
He was on vacation.
How did it happen?
Bad thing.
Bridge.
Throw me to him, Tsukuyomi.
Good.
Me too, Sakharo.
Yeah.
Dark shadow.
Takayami Fumikage.
The hero in the black cloak Tsukuyomi.
The miracle of the dark shadow.
No.
Sato Rikido.
The hero of sweets from Sakharo.
The miracle of sugar doping.
Fly.
Grape Caterpillar.
Mineta Minoru.
A fresh grape juice.
The miracle of the mandate hair.
Asui Tsuyo.
Thank you, you saved me.
Great!
Investigation team, is there something about the villains?
Nothing, we haven't found them yet.
Roger that.
Keep searching.
Was my ice not enough?
One more flame!
And it will be stronger than the previous one.
I'm going to get it.
I'm going to get it.
I'm going to get it.
We just need to put out the fire.
Roger that.
We'll do what we're going to do.
Uravity, Salafan!
That's it!
Roger that.
Uraraka Chako!
Heroic name!
Uravity!
Miracle!
Invincibility!
Go, Pinky!
I'm going to get it.

Shining hero!
It's a twinkling that can't be stopped!
Miracle!
Puppet laser!
Great.
The fire won't go any further.
This time, I'm going to get it to the end.
I think we figured it out with the fire.
Thank God.
Okay, quiet.
Not a good sound.
Attention!
Something is approaching!
Is it really...
Remember me?
I hope you didn't forget.
There are villains wandering around here.
Do you know?
Hada is portraying a villain.
There's another villain here.
And Majiki too?
Damn.
Why should I be a villain?
Everyone's looking at me.
That's it.
Imagine that they're potatoes.
They're not humans, they're roots.
I'm going home.
He just left!
Majiki is really leaving.
Is that normal?
Wait, Majiki!
No, you can't do that!
Play the role properly!
Don't move, okay?
It's dangerous.
After all, I'm a villain now.
It looks like they took a big three on the role of villains.
Pinke in hostages.
We can break through from behind.
Yeah.
Let's go.
Damn, I told you not to move.
Don't you listen to me?
I hate disobedient kids.
Really?
Full power.
Level 30.
Oh, I got washed out again.
Let's go save him.
He's going down on purpose.
Ingenium.
Yeah.
People are the priority.
Let Hada deal with Midoriya.
And we'll help save the man.
I got it.
So many sounds mixed up.
I don't understand anything.
What's going on?
It looks like Pinke was taken hostage.
Come on!
We need to save her.
No.
We need to sit here and continue the reconnaissance.
Perhaps there are no two villains at all.
What do you want, villain?
I want to go home.
Well, you can go.
If I go, Hada will get mad at me.
Like Mirio.
He asked me to do everything possible
to make you guys
worthy heroes sooner.
That's why I can't go.
A big trio is trying hard for us.
I'm grateful, of course.
But it will be difficult to deal with them.
There are fewer people here now.
Where is the Invisible?
Uraraka!
No!
I got it!
You're Hagakure!
A twisted break!
Smile!
Toru Hagakure!
Hidden Invisible Hero!
Miracle! Invisible!
What's going on?
What?
I got you.
Hada!
Ojiro Mashiro!
A hero of martial arts!
A man with a tail!
A miracle with a tail!
Now!
Deku!
Deku!
Hero's name is Deku!
Miracle!
One for all!
Strike!
Give up, please.
Why didn't you strike?
Because I couldn't.
Pity can cost you your life.
Deku!
Now I'm...
The villain!
Deku!
I'll beat you!
Red Buntar?
Kirishima Eijiru!
A brave hero, Red Buntar!
Miracle!
Thank you!
Here's our star!
Too slow!

Game over!
That's it, Bakugo!
He was so good at Samajiki!
We did it!
Agam!
Hooray!
That's it.
Praise the gods!
Too bad I didn't help much.
Yeah, you saved me.
Thank you.
Lessons are over.
I repeat.
So they're over there too?
Yeah, it looks like it.
Rana!
Huh?
Bastard.
You were holding back!
No, well, your face is just so scary.
Don't underestimate me!
Listen here.
I don't give a shit that you're just playing a role,
that you're a senior class,
that you're a villain,
that you're a villain,
that you're a villain,
that you're a villain!
They're mine, they're mine!
My enemies!
You should have gone home.
Die!
Later bring Bakugo to the teaching room.
I'll do it.
We will become the best heroes in the UA Academy, in the Heroic Academy!
We will become the best heroes in the UA Academy, in the Heroic Academy!
We will become the best heroes in the UA Academy, in the Heroic Academy!
We will become the best heroes in the UA Academy, in the Heroic Academy!
The All-Powerful had the same pose, didn't he?
His hand was different. He used his left hand.
I didn't know.
Anyway, thank you for winning.
Zero points.
It's a terrible start.
Sorry.
But it's still an important victory.
Don't rush.
I didn't expect much.
However, it doesn't matter.
We don't know each other yet, the All-Powerful.
Hi.
You're late.
In the next episode!
Hero number one, the All-Powerful.
He barely won the fierce battle with the mysterious Nomu.
However, it turned out that behind this battle stood the League of Villains and the Yastrep.
At this time, something strange was happening to my body.
Next, from the voice.
I will take a close look at the secret one for all, and all for one.
