        <pre>Let's go!
Yeah!
What the hell is this?
Sister invited us for dinner.
What?
She wanted to see my friends.
I knew you hired her!
Now tell everyone we're not friends!
Kachan!
Hello!
Thank you for finding the time.
I know you're very busy.
Thank you!
You're welcome!
Thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you!
Kachan.
Thank you for finding the time.
I know you're very busy.
I'm happy to see you.
You feel like you're home.
I'm the elder sister, Fuyumi.
During the internship in the hardworking agency, Kachan and I were invited to visit the Todoroki House.
I'm sorry, sister.
After all, I can.
I will not say that I have never experienced the same as Inazuma.
It's just that we have a chance.
Todoroki, it seems to me that every day you are getting closer to forgiving him.
If you really hate your father, then don't forgive him.
I think it's okay.
But you are such a kind person.
I think you're just waiting.
Perhaps you have such a stage now.
I think it's okay.
But you are such a kind person.
Perhaps you have such a stage now.
Perhaps you have such a stage now.
Perhaps you have such a stage now.
Perhaps you have such a stage now.
Perhaps you have such a stage now.
Perhaps you have such a stage now.
Perhaps you have such a stage now.
Perhaps you have such a stage now.
Perhaps you have such a stage now.
Perhaps you have such a stage now.
To be continued...
That's it, the villain is now under surveillance.
Thank you for your help, Staratel.
Are you afraid to think that the Almighty would have dealt with such a case half an hour earlier?
No, nothing like that.
That villain is extremely cruel.
Don't take your eyes off him.
Yes, sir!
Staratel!
Staratel...
At the first meeting, I thought...
What a flame!
Yes, such a fiery, blazing, bright, blue flame.
It seemed that you were just shining.
Do you remember, Staratel?
The day I lost hope,
I couldn't even bear the floating autumn clouds.
On that day, you caught a thief with a stone.
Then I saw you.
Since then, you have become my hope.
Seven years ago, I missed the opportunity.
You caught me alive.
The only thing that a man is allowed to do is to decide fairly.
This is the outcome of his life.
Finally!
Finally, this day has come.
Do you think I did the same thing as soon as I got out of prison?
I didn't even have time to eat.
I went to find out about your personal life.
Why do you ask?
Isn't it obvious to put a dot in it?
Yes, Staratel.
I missed you.
Your brother?
Didn't you tell me about Toya from Bakugo?
I wouldn't have done it on my own will.
Natsu and Toya were very close.
They played together forever.
It all happened soon after Mom's hospitalization.
Her condition deteriorated.
Even Shota couldn't go to her.
But it's all in the past.
Shota began to go to her.
The affairs of our family are improving.
Only Natsu remains as hostile.
He believes that it was Dad who killed Toya.
So that's why he looks like that.
Sorry for the sudden news.
No, it's okay.
It's time to take you back to school.
Yes!
Thank you for the hospitality.
The dinner was very delicious.
Thank you.
Give me the recipe for the Sichuan Mapo Tofu.
Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Give me the recipe for the Sichuan Mapo Tofu.
Okay.
She'll send it to me.
Fuyumi.
Thank you.
Thank you for being friends with Shota, Midoriya.
Midoriya-kun.
You shouldn't.
Thank you too.
Yes, it's me.
I'm sorry I had to change plans.
Yes.
Tomorrow I'm free all day.
Can we watch a movie or ...
I'll teach you everything quickly.
In the future, in addition to weekends,
you will work twice a week if you adjust the schedule.
Last time it was the same with Uraraka, Kirishima and so on.
I need to prepare for the exams.
Todoroki, can you pull me up in English?
Yes.
The number one is called.
And you can't drive a car any more.
You can't drive a car any more.
You can't drive a car any more.
What an aggressive driver.
Since when do you put all your stuff in the car?
Since I was the first.
Sho!
Apparently, success changes people.
Sho.
What the hell is Sho?
Sho!
Natsume?
What?
What?
Natsume?
Don't stick your head out, kid.
Look at the road markup.
Shut up.
Or I'll tear your tongue off.
You have a nice house, caretaker.
Let him go.
And you?
Tell me.
Do you remember me, caretaker?
Seven years ago,
I interfered with your rage.
You had a villain name.
It seems...
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Amazing.
You remembered. I'm so glad.
That's right. It was me.
I'm Ending.
I repeat.
Let him go.
I'm sorry, caretaker.
You better understand.
You have so many things
that I can't get in a million years.
I admired you.
I have nothing to protect.
I want to kill him.
I'm begging you, caretaker.
This time.
Do everything you have to do.
You have to...
Kill me.
Heroes don't kill
even in extremely difficult situations.
But on the other hand...
Nomu, you killed.
And I'm the same puppet.
I don't even know
if I'm alive or dead.
So there's nothing to worry about.
Burn me to the ground
with your blinding flame.
Let's go.
Hey!
Hey!
You forgot something.
Kachan!
What's going on?
I'll kill him.
And I'll save my father.
Definitely.
Let's protect him.
To be continued...
It's going to work out.
Winter has come!
Caretakers!
Don't ruin my death!
Fool, you broke yourself out of balance.
My hope is strong.
Let's start over.
This is my chance.
I'm faster than him.
I'm faster than him.
My hope is strong.
My hope is strong.
Oh my god.
Oh my fucking boy.
Cape Town will end like a
flash he didn't see.
My flame of hope! Oh, no!
Looks like there's not enough of a son's life to hold you back from being a hero!
Let him go. And let him free.
Right on target.
Let go of my brother!
If you're not in a hurry to kill me...
No!
More people will die!
Take this!
No more!
I made it!
It's the same here.
In fact, it's the same.
First, learn to do two things mechanically.
I can do it!
Right.
Until we're here, no one's gonna die.
You could do that in just a week.
Your wishes...
...won't come true!
Yes, you're right.
Not one of them.
I thought I was gonna die.
Are you all right?
I'm fine. You saved me.
It was you, wasn't it? Thank you.
I'm glad you're all safe and sound.
Thank you.
Hey you!
You hurt?
No!
It's hot.
There, you, old man!
What about the moron Mumey?
I caught him.
That's not right.
It's got to be...
not you.
That's not right.
That's not right.
What the hell with Deku?
What about the mobs?
If you ask about people in cars,
they're all safe.
A complete victory.
Get in!
Why?
What did you say, number one?
To winter?
And one time?
Faster than me?
How can you catch a villain?
Yeah.
You did well.
You were able to fix my mistake quickly.
You've become so nasty and modest.
Kachan!
You should be upset at least a little.
Get off!
Sorry.
For a moment,
I had an idea.
If I don't save you,
you can already...
You can never talk to me again.
What?
Natsu.
It's okay if you don't believe me,
but the truth is,
I didn't cheat on you.
However,
I ran away,
leaving all responsibility to you.
You can consider that
I killed Toyo anyway.
You didn't cheat on us?
Then what?
You always said
that's exactly what happened.
You're waiting for my forgiveness.
You won't make it.
I...
I'm not as kind as you think I am.
Nevertheless...
Nevertheless, you still came
for Fuyumi and Rei.
Fuyumi really wants
what is called a family.
After all, I ruined everything.
Tell me.
After all, you're trying
to keep her from losing her faith
in the fact that a family can be returned.
So you're kind.
You're getting closer to
forgiving him.
However,
you're such a kind person.
You can't forgive me.
I don't want your forgiveness.
I just want to buy wine.
My sister was so happy.
But when I look at her,
I remember
how much I have to take
and change
and buy wine.
What can you do?
I've come up with something.
Hey, you!
Hey, stop it!
How can you be like this?
Stop it!
Fiery,
persistent flame!
Blinding light!
My hope!
Stop it!
No, don't!
Don't!
Stop it!
His trick to control the markup
was enhanced with a chemical.
Enhanced?
Yes.
The substance is still being sold,
although in smaller volumes.
Be careful.
You will be attacked
a second time in a couple of days.
After all, the darkness will never disperse.
He is the source of the darkness!
The light from his flame
will bring darkness and destruction!
Maybe.
But the light will not go anywhere.
Guys, thank you.
I forgot your hero name.
What?
You are Bakugo, right?
No.
What?
Did you choose a hero name?
Tell me!
No way!
I will never tell you, get out!
Will you tell me?
Hell no!
You, too, get out!
It's better to tell the first passer.
Yastrip.
It looks like you really have an eye for honey.
It looks like someone remembers me.
A hard worker, I guess.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
...
...
...

The worker factory took us back to the Academy.
I found out about what happened later from Todoroki.
Did the villain attack you? Aren't you hurt?
No, Shota saved me with his friends.
Shota?
Yes.
Fuyumi, I've already talked to Shota and Natsuo.
You're trying to make your mom come home.
In the end, it turned out that we did all the work for you.
There will be no more of this.
We will build a new house where it will be easier for both of you to get there.
There you will meet your mother.
The doctor says that she will be discharged soon.
I'm sorry to say that all of a sudden I tell you to move.
Wait, dad!
Where are you going?
What can I give to my family after all the pain that I caused?
I think about it every night.
I began to dream the same dream.
It seems that the wife and children are having fun at dinner.
They laugh at the stupidity.
They enjoy it.
They are filled with happiness.
But I'm not at this table.
Yes.
After all, if I really care about them ...
What are you going to do, dad?
I'll stay here.
If I really care about them ...
And if I want to buy wine ...
Look further.
The third quarter has begun in the UAE.
We are improving our heroic skills, passing training and internship at the same time.
At this time, Aizawa and Sushimik go to meet Kurogiri in the Tartar prison.
What is the secret of Kurogiri?
Nothing.
Further.
There is no other such hero.
We could not think of such a sad truth.
Go beyond.
Plus Ultra!
