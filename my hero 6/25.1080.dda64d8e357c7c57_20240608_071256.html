        <pre>And now the army recognizes Shigaraki Tomura as the commander-in-chief.
This is the second coming.
However, we do what we want.
I'm late.
That's why it was so simple.
What happened to Deiko?
It was you, wasn't it?
If they had caught the League earlier, maybe the civilians would not have died.
It doesn't matter if it's true or not.
It still turns out that you killed someone.
The soldiers are led by the will of one person.
The network is controlled by the corporation.
Great mood.
Deathnerad is deeply connected with the industry of heroes.
Somewhere here, there is still a sense of pride.
They will do whatever they want.
This is a superhuman society, which is full of heroes,
and the strength of Shigaraki does not give them, if they do not surpass.
Good luck to us with the liberation.
Even the hawk is here.
Hey, what did you forget here, number two?
You look happy.
Yes, let me introduce you to everyone.
It's too early.
They have some kind of supporter left in the shadows.
First, you need to understand everything to the end,
and only then inform the striver and so on.
So, hawk, if you miss, Japan will come to an end.
In the last battle, your miracle happened.
Now you don't have to touch it.
You will destroy what is nearby.
You have become a real embodiment of destruction.
Let me ask you, why do you still want more power?
Since you have already offered it to me, I will take it.
You are right, I have nothing to do with cheap tricks.
But you look at me.
This is after one attempt.
And how many people do you think they have?
I don't underestimate the heroes anymore
in order to erase the Almighty from the face of the Earth.
Now it will be like this.
You put all your strength into what the enemy hates.
You have a direct relationship with the student and the teacher.
In general, initially, I was leading a group of people
for one person.
With the change of generations, miracles are mixed.
They become complex, complex.
They become ambiguous, but also powerful.
When the volume of memory increases,
the equipment will not be in time for it.
As a result, it goes out of control.
I call it the theory of the singularity of the miracle.
Kuroko, you are right.
I call it the theory of the singularity of the miracle.
Except for one, no one took me and my thoughts seriously.
If the device is not created for such a volume of memory,
then people will not be able to sing.
Signs of this have appeared in the fourth generation.
Since it has several miracles,
it realizes that the problem of the volume is serious.
I'm stuck here for a long time.
You are just like a child waiting for Christmas.
Well, yes, I am full of hope and dreams.
Now you are waiting for 4 months,
full of unbearable pain.
When you survive them, you will get everything you want.
Even one for all.
One for all.
Everything he dreamed of for one.
It was the only force that didn't work out the way he wanted.
Oh, hey, brother, listen.
Yeah, I think I can be heart-hearted.
Hmm, I had a dream.
Hmm, I was hurt more than anyone else.
I said it had nothing to do with it.
I ran away from it.
I couldn't be your shell.
I can't do it like that.
Holding my strength and weakness.
Well, it's just the beginning.
I'm standing by myself.
I'm standing by myself.
I'm standing by myself.
I'm standing by myself.
I'm standing by myself.
I'm standing by myself.
I'm standing by myself.
I'm standing by myself.
I'm standing by myself.
I'm standing by myself.
I'm standing by myself.
I'm standing by myself.
I'm standing by myself.
I'm standing by myself.
I'm standing by myself.
I'm standing by myself.
I'm standing by myself.
I'm standing by myself.
I'm standing by myself.
I'm standing by myself.
I'm standing by myself.
We are freaking superstars.
Die, people, die.
I can grab the light and bend it.
Come on, attack!
The ship day has come!
Maximum viscosity!
Acid man!
Let's go!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
People are scary.
That's it!
Ready!
Great!
You three have trained
with the hero in the armor of the hero and the husband.
There were a lot of plans
to unite attacks and defense,
so we came up with new combos.
Well, how do you like the acid man?
The idea was born thanks to the indestructible.
Great!
Continue to show what you learned
during the internship.
Yes!
Use a bunch of techniques
and calculate the future.

One for all.
Full coverage.
If you want to become the best heroes, then this is your chance.
You earned this strength with your own efforts.
It seems that it was so long ago.
You don't look at me anymore, do you?
I gained experience.
But you don't need it.
Go ahead, my boy.
Hey, Bakuga!
Do you now know how to make a blizzard of explosions?
No, asshole.
It was a condensate.
Todoroki, you got faster and hotter, didn't you?
No.
I still have a long way to go.
Midoriya, did you own those black things?
Yes.
I'm sorry about that.
You're good.
Well, you give.
Now it's my turn.
I'm going.
Now I can use them normally.
Yeah.
I'm so grateful to you for that day.
Thank you.
It was a hundred years ago.
By the way, I added some wires because of that.
I can't use them the way Cera does.
But I've been looking for a way for a long time.
I can't use them the way Cera does.
But I've been looking for a way for a long time.
I can't use them the way Cera does.
But I've been looking for something useful for a long time.
But I've been looking for something useful for a long time.
So we both got better.
I was so angry that I didn't even think about it.
So I was so angry that I didn't even think about it.
So I was so angry that I didn't even think about it.
I guess I should be restrained.
Thank you.
So what now?
I'd like something easy.
A udon, for example.
Listen, it's not for nothing.
The security mission knows something.
I see.
If you find out who creates the NOMO, how will you do it?
I'll fly there and organize a karaoke contest.
I'll boil the guts and make a soup out of the roaches.
What about you?
Me?
Teacher!
I'm sorry to interrupt.
Wipe your head.
Sorry, it's a problem.
What happened?
Teacher, my hand is itching so much.
Don't be afraid.
You're in the UAE school.
Congratulations! You got it!
Thank you very much.
You're doing great, Bakug.
It seems your potential is endless.
What?
I couldn't find out about everyone.
As a result, I couldn't find out about everyone.
But we have to move on.
Here's the next step.
One for everyone.
I gathered everything I could according to the previous owners of the miracle.
Unfortunately, I didn't find anything on the second and third.
Taking into account the nature of one for all and time frames,
it's impossible to find out.
If they knew about their miracle,
maybe they would try to leave a mark.
Who cares? Just forget it.
I don't want to waste my precious time on nonsense.
I can control the black moose in about one second.
And I can't control them like Seru or the teacher Aizawa.
But I think a powerful and helpful miracle has already come out of them.
Have you ever talked to the previous owners?
No.
The fifth owner, Tsarkam.
His real name is Daigoro Banjo.
The black moose's miracle.
It releases energy from the body.
It has a great grip and acts in the air.
Some of them, including him, didn't start with strong miracles.
I've never even heard of this fool's name.
What? He has a great miracle.
From your pathetic point of view, all the miracles are great, Dodik.
You're just saying it. How much can you do?
In fact, Bakug is right.
One for all.
He was chained to one for all.
At the time when evil was so powerful that we couldn't even dream of it,
he crushed everyone who was strong for one.
It became possible thanks to his unbreakable hostility.
Before his death, he was tormented as if in hell.
The previous owners trusted the power of the future,
uniting it into one.
They were not chosen at all.
In the battle that repeated over and over again,
they were just the ones who trusted and who they trusted.
It's no wonder that they all died young.
Yes, that's right.
So what does this bastard have to do next?
Next, he has to learn how to fly.
The miracle of my teacher.
The teacher of the Almighty, Shimura Nana.
The new power.
I won!
I can fly thanks to the explosion.
And you, fool, will waste your time on what I already know.
In the meantime, I'll sharpen my skills at the internship even more.
In short, I made you a piece of shit.
Who are you?
No, it's bad. I need to master it faster.
You'll do it again. You'll panic and die.
No, I've already dealt with the black tails.
You'll die, I say!
Don't try to convince him.
Where have you been?
You came very late.
If you don't start helping us, you won't get the meat.
I'm already running.
If you don't give me the meat, I'll kill you.
Do you want to live?
He's just like a villain.
If you don't like it, help us.
You can add anything to it.
What a great dish.
But no tea leaves, please.
What a moron, he chopped onions.
It was me.
Your sister would cry.
What about you?
And you're good.
You're too bad. Die!
Who wants orange juice?
Class B will be good for you later, right?
Who said they'd bring the couch?
So, for the past internship and the beginning of the new semester
with the meat party, let's get started.
This one's not fried enough.
You did it on purpose, didn't you?
It's so hot in the cold.
When it gets warm again, we'll be second-graders.
Time flies so fast.
It was so crazy.
We'll have second-graders.
But the heroes don't have circles, so we won't see them.
God, we'll have promising kids.
Guys, we have about three months left.
Don't forget, there are exams ahead.
Nida, shut up! You're spoiling the taste of the meat.
Actually, it doesn't affect him.
God, you don't understand anything at all.
It's sarcasm.
Are you worried about the exams?
It's too early.
I'm on your side, Mineta.
Sometimes I get too deep into myself.
I think about the fact that I'm here now.
I can't believe that the Almighty is teaching me.
And the fact that I'm talking to the kids normally is amazing too.
I…
Vidor, can you please tell me in Japanese?
I'm so lucky.
Midoriya.
Onzo.
Oh, sorry. Here.
Thank you.
So, where are you?
Why are you sitting in the cold?
Yeah, just like that.
Did you want something?
Yes, I have a message from Tsukauchi.
He wants to postpone the meeting with the spotter.
Thank you.
Listen, how is Eriya doing?
She's sleeping like a baby.
I'm going to start studying for this week.
I'll help you.
I'll be glad.
What's wrong?
I decided to live here.
What?
I just don't know how to say it.
I feel powerless.
Every time I see the success of the students,
I'm angry that I can't do anything for them.
And you're still the same workaholic.
What?
You've been protecting this country for decades.
Sudden changes have revealed your addiction.
Can't you be softer?
You can do something.
Just live.
Because you inspire people with your existence.
Let yourself relax with a calm soul.
As always.
Thank you.
Supernatural front of liberation.
No.
Someone is still standing behind Shigaraki.
The key word is the hospital.
Oh, it's something new.
Good morning, doctor.
Good morning.
How's your work going?
Great.
All that's left is to wait for the final touches.
You can't make a mistake at the moment of attack.
Let the heroes grow up.
And I'll collect information.
I'll find out everything about the liberation battle.
Denix is already very close.
The kindness that I've been hoping for
Will someday become the kindness I've been waiting for
If I'm connected to you beyond the one
I'll see the line that will never come again
The sadness that has been thrown away
That no one can convey
Look at the fire that has been burned
It's not a lie, it's not a lie
The future from now on
I feel like I can connect to you
No matter where you are
I'll save you from the nightmare
I'll save you from the nightmare
I'll save you from the nightmare
I'll save you from the nightmare
It's spring break already.
And every weekend we have to spend it for the internship.
The spring break is almost over.
They say we'll have the expeditionary mission.
Yes, it's true.
Your mission too?
Seriously?
And we're doing the same.
We're going to this mission, too.
What?
It's weird.
Yeah, and you're gonna make it to the first class, aren't you?
Uh-huh.
At the foot of this mountain of heroes!
We're evacuating the residents over there, back there!
The League of Villains!
The League of Villains!
The League of Villains!
The League of Villains!
The League of Villains.
No.
The Supernatural Liberation Front.
A terrible event that will shake the super-society.
It will happen soon.
