        <pre>What is it? What's going on?
Aizawa, Vlad. Stop him. Something's wrong.
Ndeco, calm down!
Shinsou, help me! Stop Ndeco with your magic!
Midoriya, will you fight with me?
Yes!
Fire!
You're just in time!
Guys, are you all right?
Here they are! Get them!
Midoriya, Uraraka, how are you?
Now everyone's together!
Fight!
Fight!
I won't hurt anyone anymore.
What should I do?
I have to think too much.
To be continued
To be continued
To be continued
What shall we do?
All-powerful!
While we wait, we watch.
Aizawa, what are you doing?
The fifth fight continues.
Continues?
I agree. Something strange happened to Midoriya.
If this repeats, we'll stop right away.
We'll get Midoriya out of there.
Shinsou's magic stopped him.
Aizawa!
Why?
Because they didn't give up.
I'm talking about Midoriya and Shinsou.
Although, no, not only them.
Everyone else wants to win.
And you?
I don't understand.
I don't understand.
I don't understand.
And you?
I don't understand.
I don't understand.
Deku, is he stronger than you?
Deku!
You can't use your magic in such a situation.
I'm going to be in danger again.
Then let's step back.
Let's get together.
If we step back, we lose.
Now Shinsou is right in front of us.
This is our chance to win.
Wait!
Deku, if you decide to fight, then you will fight without a reason?
No.
Uraraka, will you do something?
Acid strike!
Rost!
You can't hurt me.
Impact repeat!
Fire!
Grape shield!
Mineta!
The balls of my magic don't stick to me.
I can bounce back from them.
The ones that I threw away are mine.
You can't do that.
I can bounce back from them.
The ones that I threw away are mine.
At the same time, the trap for the enemy and the trampoline for me.
This is all part of my plan.
After all, I am not able to withstand the power of double impact.
And for the sake of this!
Are you okay?
Acid strike!
Combo grape!
Pinky!
Mineta jump!
It's a nightmare!
Don't turn away!
Now we should step back, but they are too fast.
It's time to come up with a plan.
Really?
Mineta and Ashuda fight well.
When they are close, Ashuda blooms.
She is incredible.
Those two are useless in close combat.
Shoda has to defend himself.
There is a difference in number.
Why didn't the teachers stop the fight?
What about Midori and Uraraka?
Don't become stronger on your own.
I copy other people's miracles.
It doesn't make me the main character.
At the same time, I don't hate the body that nature gave me.
After all, in every masterpiece there are secondary characters
that are superior to the main character.
And now I have...
It can't be!
I have your miracle!
He has one for all!
The unprepared body will not cope.
The limbs will break off, and the body will explode.
Monobu, stop! It's dangerous!
It's too late!
Gunhead's martial art!
Deku, this is not your strength! He's bluffing!
It didn't work.
Damn it!
Did I fail?
Monobu!
No!
We didn't fight at the sports festival.
Right, Midori?
If you lose Shinsuke, the fight will change in a second.
You're a threat to us, Shinsuke.
Shinsuke!
Aizawa, Midori is going to fight.
Yes, I see.
Midori.
Damn it!
Aizawa, it took you six years to master this technique?
How can I master it in such a short time?
Six years have gone by like nothing.
When they train you, it's completely different.
For people like us,
there will come a time when we will either be able to handle it ourselves or die.
Do as I said.
Believe me.
I'm not one of those who spends time in vain.
I'm not like before.
To catch them, you have to move faster.
I'm sorry.
To become a pro, I have to become stronger.
Midori!
In the morning, I was very nervous,
but now everything is fine.
That's why it's very important to keep your heart in check.
I think it's because of the voice and support of that person.
A lot of things in it reminded me of the Almighty.
Keep your heart.
And master them all.
I'm not afraid of my strength anymore.
It's on my side.
Keep your heart in check.
Will you be able to become a hero?
Once the Almighty told me so.
How much time have we spent on the beach?
My nature.
When I remember all this,
it immediately seems that there is nothing impossible for me.
Wait, why?
Now it's not like before.
Probably he asked Uraraku to help,
and he concentrated on his strength.
What happened in these few minutes, my boy?
Damn!
So what?
Was that explosion really a bluff?
Don't you dare play on my feelings!
That's all.
His strength.
It disappeared in a moment.
I didn't have the pain from the inside.
This miracle also contains another power,
developed in one for all.
Now it's stronger than in my time.
My body couldn't cope with the improved version.
You can't use such a power at a power of 20%.
It feels clear that I can't use this ability yet.
I can only master it when I deal with one for all.
The problem is that my air power is unstable,
and I'm at risk of breaking down again.
One for all will be at 8%.
This is the second time I'll take Midoriya under control.
I'm sorry, Monomo.
Tell me, will Midoriya not freeze his soul?
If we give him a little bit of weakness, we'll lose right away.
He'll be able to find a way out of the situation.
So Midoriya will be our main task.
In any case, if we don't get rid of him, we won't be able to do anything.
We're counting on you, Shinsou.
You've been working so hard to give us a chance.
It can't just end like this.
Poltergeist won't be able to hit me.
It's been five minutes since the beginning of this fight.
Monomo's miracle is so effective.
Actually, now my miracle works for 10 minutes.
If I suddenly attack, can you get me out of here alone?
Be careful, including Shinsou's miracle.
Do you know how many miracles I can copy?
He definitely has a Poltergeist Yanagi.
Give me another size.
The last strategically should be the control of the mind.
Ah, three.
So you decided to try?
Yes.
Ah, three.
You decided that because I have three hours?
What if this is my catch?
And in fact, now I can take four.
How many different miracles can be combined?
I can't use more than one at a time.
But some effects are preserved.
Usually those that do not act directly on the body last longer.
For example, Kodai's size.
If I increase the nut, then even after another miracle, it will remain large.
Do you understand what I'm talking about?
I'm talking about fire!
The desperate move of a secondary character.
Monomo did something to the deck!
Stop.
Uraraka, can you do something?
Give me weightlessness.
I'll go to Shinsa.
And you take care of Monomo.
And then there's Dekashida and Minetti.
Don't worry about me.
I can't win in close combat.
I'll do it so that I have to fight under my conditions.
He's fast.
He'll catch up.
Fire!
Double impact.
You can hit him for the second time in the same place, but much stronger.
Shinsa, I'm sorry you got caught first.
I wonder if I did a good job.
Monomo!
Did he just use Shoda's miracle?
I'm called the mobile Hercules.
Great.
You took one.
The rest will be easier.
Ashida!
Oh, no!
Well done, Shoda and Nagi!
You can do it!
Turn the game around!
Don't forget.
Always remember.
Where are you from?
Reiko!
Damn it!
Nagi!
Don't worry about me.
I can do it.
I can do it!
I'll win!
I'll win!
Damn it!
I've been waiting for this.
I wanted to show how much I've changed.
You're all moving forward.
You're breaking apart.
Don't stop.
You're going further and further.
Get out of the way.
Plus Ultra, right?
Damn it!
You're so cool!
It was a close call.
But now the fifth match is over.
This is the end of the match.
In each round, you studied your opponents and yourself.
You fought bravely.
And now we will announce the winners.
In the first match, A.
In the second match, B.
In the third match, a draw.
In the fourth match, A.
And in the fifth match, class A.
The winner of the class competition...
Class A!
I can't say that I had a spirit of rivalry.
Yes, I don't understand why it's so offensive.
Almost everyone was deceived.
Teacher.
I couldn't do anything alone.
I'm not strong enough yet.
It was my entrance exam.
Did you know that?
Did you tell him that?
No.
I just thought about the moment and the format.
It's a great opportunity to test me.
And I was the only one who participated twice.
We still have to analyze the matches, so go to the others.
It's time to analyze!
Well, I'll start with Midoriya.
What happened to you?
Ah, but...
Something black and terrible appeared.
What kind of crazy trick is this?
It's a new technique.
If it's a new technique, then why is it so different from your magic?
To be honest, I don't understand it myself yet.
I was overwhelmed with power, I couldn't hold it back.
As if something I trusted suddenly let go of my claws.
Then I was very scared.
It's good that Uraraka and Shinsos managed to stop me.
I immediately realized that this would not end.
I don't know what would have happened if Shinsos hadn't cut me off with his magic.
I didn't know what would have happened.
Shinsos asked me if I was pretending.
No, I really didn't know what was going on.
Thank you both.
In general, I tried to talk to him for the sake of control.
He was touched by my words.
It was clear that he was pretending.
And that's exactly when Midoriya broke off, Shinsos did a great job.
Well, the way Uraraka reacted quickly was just amazing.
She risked her own health to stop her friend.
Yes, it's so great, I love it.
Uraraka, you flew to him right away.
That was a speed.
Hugged with all your might, huh?
I jumped without thinking.
I guess I should be more reserved.
Although it's better not to do anything and then regret it.
I want to save people.
And you've grown up, Uraraka.
I'm going to save you.
I did it not only for Midoriya's sake.
I just listened to Uraraka.
And also...
I saw how much power she had hit the riot police and others.
If we hadn't stopped her, we would still have lost.
I stopped Midoriya because I wanted to fight him and win.
The rest is just a coincidence.
In the depths of my soul, I did all this for myself.
Nobody asked you about it.
Everyone present is engaged every day to become the heroes who save people.
To cope with this, you need to be omnipotent.
Even if you always put others first, you won't be able to save.
If you can't cope on your own, you won't be able to protect anyone.
Therefore, all your actions will be useful for the passing ball.
But I still have a long way to go.
After the battle, I understood it clearly.
I personally saw how strong the Heroic Faculty is.
It's just not enough to pass.
I will try even harder and aim even higher.
That's great.
Keep in mind plus Ultra.
Yes!
In the next episode...
A new power has awakened in one of us.
It's a miracle of one of the previous bearers.
That man told me that there will be six other miracles inside me.
I think...
Or is it like all of us for one?
Yes, it's like all of us for one.
I think it's like all of us for one.
I think it's like all of us for one.
I think it's like all of us for one.
I think...
Or is it like all of us for one?
Yes, it's like all of us for one.
I think it's like all of us for one.
I think it's like all of us for one.
I think it's like all of us for one.
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
