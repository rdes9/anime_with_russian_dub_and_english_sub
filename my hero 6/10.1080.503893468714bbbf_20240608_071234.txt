Since the time has not yet come, it means that it will come one day.
Then something will happen to the heir one for all.
It will be difficult to communicate with Class B Shinsou's team when we open fire.
And my worries about one for all did not go to the end.
I can't get under the control of Shinsou's mind at all.
Since childhood, people have been telling me that with such a miracle, a superhero will not come out of me.
What are you talking about?
We both realize our limits.
For the sake of survival, we use good and evil.
I like you, because we are the same field of berries.
I hope not.
I hope not.
Alas, it is so.
And how did you make Midoriya talk at the sports festival for his miracle?
I didn't know him, so I just insulted his classmate.
In order to become a hero, you always have to behave like a hero.
Otherwise, we will not win the force capable of anything.
We are similar, but we do not reach the idols.
Didn't you feel that your childhood dreams and hopes are becoming more and more difficult?
Like a curse.
It looks like Midoriya's team is repeating the construction of Bakug's team.
They have a similar balance of power, except for the role of Jiro.
Can I say that this is intelligence?
They don't have it, so they'll have to be careful.
You're right.
If they decide to find the enemy by tricking him,
then Midoriya will have to work much harder than Bakug.
First, I'll draw the enemy's attention to something bright.
I'm the fastest, and Class B won't be able to ignore me.
They'll attack me.
We'll find them and capture them together.
It's started!
This is Poltergeist Yanagi.
Monomo!
Oh, so you found me.
We saw Bakug's fight, so of course we were wary of you.
You're right.
I'm wary of strong people who can move like him.
I wish a smart person would think of you like that.
On the other hand, a smart person would think of something else.
That guy was so strong thanks to the help of the other three.
That's why we should start with this trio.
Thank you for giving me your location yourself.
Looks like my allies have already found your dear guys.
He's provoking me.
Most likely, he copied Shinsou's mind control.
There are three of them against four of them.
Do you think they can handle it?
There's Shinsou there, so they won't be able to communicate.
I think it's time for you to hurry them up.
Oh, wait.
What if that recent scream was made by Shinsou?
It looks like you're going to give me the location of the team yourself.
Oh, come on.
You didn't even look at your guys?
Heartless.
He's trying to find them, in my opinion.
He won't make it.
Well...
Hey, it's Monomais from Class B.
The hero's name is the Ghost Thief.
This is a copy miracle.
After touching a person,
they copy his miracle for five minutes.
Two miracles don't work at once.
Does he have Yanagi's miracle?
It's cancelled.
I heard a voice.
It wasn't me.
So, Shinsou...
He's not far away.
I'd like to see his white face.
Look at us before you speak.
Something's stuck.
Oxidation.
It's gone.
The signal is blocked.
Or is it a trap?
It's Yanagi's Poltergeist.
Right everywhere.
Yanagi Reiko from Class B.
The hero's name is Emily.
The miracle is Poltergeist.
He can control anything up close.
However, he can't lift something heavier than human weight.
Koda Yui from Class B.
The hero's name is the Rule.
The miracle is size.
It changes the size of things and touch.
It doesn't work on living things.
It's cancelled.
The hit's repeated.
Fire!
I knew where they were.
The cat.
Merenge Kishoda from Class B.
The hero's name is Mimei.
The miracle is double impact.
He can repeat the impact on your observation
where the hit has been hit.
The second hit's a lot stronger.
The second hit is much more powerful.
Let's hide and prepare for the second run.
Second run.
I was scared.
What is Midori doing there?
He didn't distract the enemy's attention at all.
I think they already understood where we are.
What about Deku?
I managed to talk to Shinsou here.
They discussed how the gifted destroy the world.
I have a question for you.
Please explain how Bakugo can smile so carelessly.
He was caught by the villains.
Is it his fault that we lost the symbol of the world?
He looked at me and said,
The time has not yet come.
What exactly is the time for?
What is it?
What? Another new power?
I'm tired of it already.
What is it? What's the matter?
Everything was fine just now.
Run!
Shinsou!
Shinsou, run!
The power overflows me!
I can't hold it!
What is it?
Deku!
What is it? What is it?
Enough! It hurts!
Why?
Midori has another new technique?
Aizawa! Vlad!
Stop him!
Something's wrong.
Why?
The day when the Almighty gave me the power
The day when the Almighty gave me the power
I was constantly suffering because of my ignorance.
Enough!
Go away!
Despite that, I started to control with my power.
It was only the beginning.
Go away!
One for all!
I don't want anyone else to worry!
Deku, calm down!
When I was a child, my parents looked tired all the time.
It was painful for me to see them like that.
One day I saw the hero for the first time at work.
But I didn't look at his actions, but at the expressions of the observers.
I liked that everyone was so happy.
And so helping others was an ordinary thing for me.
But sometimes an ordinary thing can be incredibly difficult.
I watched how desperately he fought for the sake of helping others and thought...
Deku!
Heroes protect people.
But who will protect them when they are in pain?
Enough!
I can't do it!
Deku, we can't control you!
Shinsuo!
Help me!
Stop Deku with your magic!
Control Midori?
What can I say?
One day I lost to you.
I was delighted.
Now I want to fight you.
I wanted to show you my new self.
I waited patiently for the next fight.
I wanted to become a worthy hero and help others with my magic.
Midori!
Will you fight me?
Yes!
Again?
Hey, you!
You don't understand!
You don't understand!
We told you that you are not alone!
Did you forget?
The time has come!
It's obvious!
But...
You will not be able to use your strength anymore.
Remember that.
Is this one of the heirs?
One for all?
Work harder!
With hard work, almost everything will be done by itself!
Did you swallow your tongue?
Okay!
I see him so clearly.
This is not a remnant, shadow or something else.
And I'm not in a dream.
This man...
And all those I've seen...
Are they still living inside one for all?
It seems that my time is running out.
In general, boy,
the power that has now arisen
was my miracle.
Our abilities were mixed
with the heart of this power.
However, the tiny one will not always
be a part of one for all.
Crumble in the flame
on the surface of the rising waves.
The roots of this power
will be destroyed.
The roots of this power
are surrounded by developed abilities.
Right now,
the heart is becoming more and more.
It has come into motion.
You saw it
between the fluctuations.
The very essence
of one for all
is growing.
Why?
What will happen now?
Listen.
You thought at that moment
that's what happened, didn't you?
I tried to catch Monomo.
My miracle,
the Black Whip,
fits better for this.
You were lucky
that I was the first.
This is a good miracle.
However,
this miracle also contains
another power,
developed in one for all.
This is a good miracle in my time.
Damn, I'm disappearing.
I'll be gone very soon.
After all,
only the spirit is left of me.
Remember,
you take advantage of the power of rage,
and it will react to it.
Therefore, it is important
to keep your heart in your mouth.
It's okay to be angry.
This emotion gives power.
That's why you need to learn
to control it clearly.
One for all
was already in the eighties.
It is logical that now
its power is incredible.
Listen to me.
In time,
you will have six more miracles.
Keep your heart
and master them all.
Good luck, guy.
We are with you.
It is you who will complete
the miracle.
Deku!
Deku!
Hey, Deku!
Sorry, did it hurt?
Uraraka!
Go away, it's dangerous here!
Don't be afraid.
It's all over thanks to Silishinso.
Thanks to him?
Is everything okay?
Uraraka!
You're hurt!
Damn!
So I...
My Gunhead art!
Actually, we're not done yet!
No!
Fire!
Those crazy black things
have ruined our plan!
You're just in time!
Guys, are you okay?
What was that?
Here they are!
Take this!
Midori, Uraraka!
How are you?
Now everyone is together!
Get ready!
Use the power of anger.
It will react to it.
That's why it's important
to keep your heart under control.
I won't hurt anyone
anymore!
What do we do?
We have to think too much!
What do we do?
All-powerful!
Let's wait and see.
Aizawa, what are you doing?
The fifth fight
continues.
The fifth fight
continues.
The sixth fight
continues.
The sixth fight
continues.
The sixth fight
continues.
The sixth fight
continues.
The sixth fight
continues.
The sixth fight
continues.
The sixth fight
continues.
The sixth fight
continues.
The sixth fight
continues.
The next series.
One of all
came out of control.
To win by a surprise is dangerous for me.
But I do not want to stop this fight.
Shinsamon and the others think the same way.
We will fight to the fullest.
For the sake of our comrades. For the sake of victory.
Next, our show.
Don't forget.
Always remember your essence.
Go beyond the limits, plus Ultra!
