        <pre>I went to the prestigious academic institution of the yo-yo academy.
After entering the Heroic course, I continued to pursue my dream.
I will keep running towards my dreams!
To resist the difficulties and save people with a smile on their face.
In order to become the greatest of the heroes!
And now, it's my one and only
No matter how many times I cry, I can't stop
I don't expect it to be simple days
Follow my way, take me to regret
Follow my way, aim for the future
Hey, boy!
I know what I have to do now
Make my story
I want to live with you
I'm sure there will be a day when I will cry
If I look back at that time
I want to make a path to move forward
One and only
Of course, we watched
It's a miracle that he makes more things
That's not all
I need more ice
I don't think he can make more
Because it's not an ordinary metal
It can withstand any temperature
Okay
Didn't I tell you, Todoroki?
Even if you're too cool to be in the team
Don't underestimate us
Well, then
Come on! Yes!
Let's do it!
Come on!
Water vs. fire and heavy items vs. ice
They know how to act against me
It's useless
Where did he go?
The commission for conducting the exam
Surely not by accident built a production zone
You need to fight taking into account the knowledge of the terrain and buildings
He's there! Surround him!
Then I'm sure there's something in this cistern
He deceived us!
Bastard!
You're just a psycho!
As expected, the commission did not allow too dangerous substances
Bastard!
I'm sorry
I can't afford to lose
Use both sides at the same time
I need more practice
I'm too slow
You finished the first stage
Go to the waiting room
Faster!
These missions convey information about who lost and who passed
They can recognize whose balls hit them, as well as the speed and power of the hit
And many other factors
Plus, they can only be removed with a special magnetic key
Surprisingly advanced technology
Ms. Sai
Several students from the UAE entered the building
Show me them
Got it
Duplicator, a girl with sound waves, a frog and a miracle that can create objects
I know who will be our victim
Will you meet them all?
Okay, Ms. Sai
Ms. Sai
The formula of my success has already been completed
There are already so many people
Seriously?
I love the man with the seal
He is a very passionate hero
Why is he talking to me?
He received a recommendation like me
Well, you know what I think?
What did you say?
I don't understand what you're talking about
You're the only one talking here, aren't you?
56 people have already passed
Please hurry up
Shoji, what do you see?
Nothing, I can't see anyone yet
Maybe there's no one here?
Quite possible
Eoi Rose, have you heard the message?
More than half have already passed
We have no time to look for everyone else
It's time to start hunting
Yes, you're right
I hear steps on the stairs
Ten floors below
They are approaching
Are they hunting us?
I'm worried that there are so few of them
All schools are large groups
Maybe their comrades have lost and they are looking for a shelter for themselves?
I don't think so
They are still going up
There should be more of them
A bait?
Could it be?
Jiro!
The music is playing
It doesn't work on me, but Jiro is very sensitive to it
They don't know about Jiro and her magic
So they are still hunting us
That's bad
We don't know anything about our opponent
The first phase is completed
We are starting the second one
What's that?
A shelter!
Are they attacking from the street?
No
They are trying to block our view
They are getting rid of Jiro and Shoji's advantage
Which is good for finding the enemy
Who would resist us?
He knows who we are and what kind of magic we have
Jiro and Shoji, what do you think they are doing?
Obviously they are not letting us get away from here
And then they will surround us
Yes, it means that they are already nearby
Then we will fight
Don't act without a plan
Heart sound!
The second phase is completed
Jiro!
Are you hurt?
They broke my power and my left ear
How did they see her?
And she used her super technique only once
What a clever plan
There is someone very smart among our enemies
Jiro!
There is someone very smart among our enemies
Is it getting colder here?
I think so too
The cold air is coming from the ventilation
The third phase has started
They have locked us
The temperature is sharply decreasing
Holy shit!
Jiro!
Jiro!
Jiro!
What's wrong with you?
The frogs are falling asleep at a low temperature
Until it gets warmer
Fire!
Make a lighter, Jiro!
No, we can't do that
If we light a fire, the fire-fighting system will work
The water will only be colder
Then the electric heater
They control the air conditioner
And they won't have any problems with electricity
Here is the blanket
Great
What's this?
They are building a door
They won't let us escape
There is only one left
Let's try to break through
The enemy is waiting for us behind the door
It's dangerous
They are a step ahead of us now
What should we do?
If we stay here, we will have to do something with the temperature
Otherwise we will just freeze
I'm with Momo
Let's make a bomb and open the emergency exit
It will create a spheroic explosion
And they probably figured out that we can do it
That's why they locked us here and lowered the temperature
How come?
Think, Momo
How do we get out of this difficult situation?
Jiro can't use his magic with his damaged ear
Can we break the wall to escape?
No, our enemy is probably ready for such a simple move
First, we need to come up with something with the air conditioner
I will create a glue to seal it
I see 8 ventilation holes here
Although for this we will have to lay out a little, but there is no way out
Ms.Sai, the third phase is completed
Well, now let's wait a little
Yes
Their main problem is the air conditioner in the room
In order to solve the problem, they use the magic of Yaoi Rose
Her magic is not endless
In other words, it will weaken her
We will make all their magic useless
This is my plan
Perfect formula
AI Academy, second year
Intellis Aiko, IQ wonder
She drinks tea, closes her eyes and increases her IQ several times
Without a wonder, her IQ is about 150
What makes her a genius without it?
By the way, her wonder depends on the quality of the tea
Come on, use your wonder
This will be the end for you all
What happened to Yaomou?
Why did you stop creating?
No matter what plan I come up with, I get only one answer
Our opponent wants me to use my wonder
He wants you to use your wonder?
Yes
Their whole plan is to get rid of me
I'm not the only one who wants to get rid of you
I'm not the only one who wants to get rid of you
I'm not the only one who wants to get rid of you
I'm not the only one who wants to get rid of you
Their whole plan is to get rid of me
First, they turned off Asui so that I could warm her up
Their whole plan is based on this
I see
They were going to come in when they completely got rid of you
Yes, that's why I can't use my wonder now
I have to save my strength until the right moment
But if we stay here, we'll fail the exam
We have to break through
I'm sure they're waiting for this
Then what do you suggest?
What would they do in such a situation?
Todoroki, Ida, Midoriya
Sometimes I don't understand myself
But if I understand that I can reach it, I'll do it with all my strength
I can't stop thinking that I want to save him
That's right
I'll save them
Shoji, Jiro, Asui
I'm not going to think about the exam anymore
I have to focus on saving them no other way
What can I do?
What can I create now?
Guys, please wait a couple of minutes
I'm at Mom's!
Please!
What?
Headphones?
Put them on, please!
This is the first time I create something like this
Its structure is not that complicated
And I still have strength
I have to make it big
As big as possible!
It's...
It's been 10 minutes
I think it's time
Get ready for the storm
Got it!
I wonder how they are inside
I'll look at the first one
What?
It's a low-frequency sound!
Even in headphones, I can feel it with my whole body
Are you okay, Asui?
Guys, hang in there a little more
Six
Five
Four
Three
Two
One
Great!
It worked!
Put your headphones on
It worked!
Put your swords on them
Okay
Can you move?
Yeah
I'm okay
I'm so happy
No!
You used your premonition for the attack, not for the defense
I couldn't even think that the UA elite would take such a stupid risk
But now you can't move
You'll fall off my arm
I can't give up now
Show her the results of your training, Mom
I'll show you
Mom!
Don't mess with me!
Guys!
Why did you come back?
She would have probably failed
You're in the middle of the exam
You should be thinking about yourself, not your friends
Is that what you're looking at?
But we're not like that
We'll never leave our friends
And we'll never give up
If I have to choose one of the two
I'll still save both of them
Exactly, Midori
That's how Class 1A does it
I didn't expect this from UA
I was completely defeated
Kaminario, why did you follow us?
Well, everyone ran, I ran
I thought it would be more fun
Shut up already!
What tone is that?
Stop wasting time, Bakug
There's probably a bunch of people up there
Let's work together
Die!
I said, stop wasting time!
Watch out!
Kirishima!
Damn it, let go!
What is this?
What's going on?
So you did it
I'll kill you
At the moment, 60 students have passed
There are only 40 free seats left
There are whole groups passing
What are we going to do?
They'll keep looking for us
I think we'll be able to deal with the next group
What? What do you mean?
There were those among them who tried to steal the glasses
I'll take it on myself
Hey, wait!
They're panicking too
The more hunters, the more loot you need
In the end, they'll have to fight each other
Exactly, for such a group, you need a lot of victims
Their advantage doesn't make sense
Then why did you want us to unite, Midoriya?
The point is that you need to hit the target with the swords
But it's very difficult, no matter how you look at it
Besides, we don't know what our opponents are up to
We had to concentrate on the defense from the start
After that, I wanted to connect the enemies
And easily distribute our targets
We have a lot of people in our class who can connect the enemy
That's why it would work
I see
And the truth is, throwing swords is just so stupid
You need to immobilize the enemy
It's not such a simple test, as it seems
Quiet, do you hear?
They're close
What are we going to do?
I'm going out
What?
I'm going to distract them, and you're going to immobilize as many people as possible
Your tricks are perfect for this
So it's a bait
We need two of them
Six people?
I understand
What?
Let's do it, Seru!
Okay
I believe in you, Daiko
Especially after what you've done
Great, let's go
Let's go
We are students of Shiketsu
And we are obliged to wear our uniform with dignity
Why?
Because the pride of the entire academy lies on our shoulders
This is a demonstration of strength
I want to show the difference between those who carry pride in their academy
And those vulgar blunders who didn't even move a finger for their self-improvement
I hate people like you
What did he say?
I don't understand a word
He said my eyes are so narrow that I don't see my enemies
My eyes are beautiful and big
This is his complex
Maybe we shouldn't provoke him like that
The U.A. Academy is worthy of my respect
I'm proud that we are considered equal
But your dignity has been useless lately
What the hell is this?
He's attacking
Shut up
Responsibility? Pride?
You repeat the same thing
Maybe you'll show your strength, huh, dear?
You're the worst, Bakugo
We need to provoke the enemies and make them get together in one place
Do you want a gum?
A gum that hits your fingers?
I don't want it
It's a pity that you can't see who got through and who got out
Shinda's earthquake didn't help much
Huh? What? You're worried about them?
Watching this class, I noticed something interesting
In the class itself, you still haven't understood
But there are two students who wake up to the actions of others
Not to say that they are leaders or popular
And they don't get along with each other
But...
When something serious happens, they are always at the center of the event
Joke, I'm not worried
I expect
Even if they are far from their comrades, they lift them up on their feet
I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid
Even if they are far from their comrades, they lift them up on their feet
Have you fallen in love with them?
I'm jealous
That's my class
Class 1A
