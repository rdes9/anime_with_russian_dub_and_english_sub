Wow, Chaco, you have a new suit! It suits you very well!
Yeah, and it's really great!
Really? I'm so happy!
Oh, is this a new bag?
It's heavy!
It's because of the wires.
With my magic, a big weight is not a problem.
Although the suitcase is heavy.
What's here?
Ah!
What's this?
I knew it!
Everything is wrong, Ashida!
Honestly, everything is wrong.
What?
I just keep it with me.
I take care of it.
What?
Did you get used to that crazy thing?
Yes.
Seriously, how fast?
You mean that thing when black shit flew out of your hand?
Yes, I called them black whips.
Wow, that's so cool!
Yes, training with hero number one is another level.
You are developing faster.
I still release whips only for a moment.
The application is limited, but they are powerful.
Midoriya!
Bakugo, what are you doing?
I'm getting angry.
Oh no, his spinal-brain fluid is leaking!
Midoriya!
The most important thing is that the body can withstand it.
I'm here!
Weird, with sweet cotton!
The feeling of speed is completely different, so...
Guys!
I put everything into this thing, and you just passed by!
All-powerful!
I'm here!
Weird, with sweet cotton!
I'm here!
And where is Aizawa's teacher?
He just got some serious business.
Can't you do it faster?
I'm already in a hurry, calm down!
We fought in the NK.
He didn't behave himself so close.
It all smells too bad.
I don't believe him.
I'm sure Tsukauchi and others made a mistake.
As you know,
Nomu is a genetically modified body of people.
Such people can withstand several miracles.
However,
they are not people.
Nomu is just a puppet.
They don't have their own will.
More precisely, that's what we thought.
Grontarino,
for this reason, we left the lessons.
Please, make it shorter.
Aizawa!
Calm down!
Calm down!
Calm down!
Calm down!
Calm down!
It's important to tell.
Let's do it right.
For the sake of the right mood.
He is one of the main members of the villainous league.
If we talked to him,
it would be a powerful blow to the league.
Unfortunately, he doesn't tell the important things.
He talks about nothing.
And when it comes to what will hurt the league,
he suddenly stops answering and seems to switch.
And what's the conclusion?
It's a difficult question.
And it took a lot of time to realize.
It turns out that many factors were mixed
to create one new miracle.
And the factor that lies in their basis
is connected with the person
you knew at the U.A. school.
As far as we know,
he died when he was still young.
We found out that his miracle
is similar to the power of Oboro Shirakube.
Once we all tried to become heroes together.
Shota! Hizashi!
Let's create our own agency after the release.
I consider the three of us to be capable of anything.
And we are three.
Even if one is wrong,
two others will cover him.
I already said that Shota is a master at marking small things.
And Hizashi is a master of negotiations.
What do you say?
Let's do it.
There's nothing to add.
That's decided.
Yes, Shota?
I...
I haven't agreed yet.
Oh, come on!
Let's do it!
Oboro Shirakube died
during our joint internship.
He was stuck in a falling building.
A sudden death.
We wanted to establish our agency.
He died shortly after those words.
So...
Kurogiri Nomu
is also highly likely
to be based on Oboro Shirakube.
We were called the three idiots of Class A.
I don't understand anything!
Why are we attacking the UAE?
The answer is obvious.
There are a lot of amazing things there.
It's logical that this is our goal.
It's like looking for pieces
in a middle-class restaurant.
Probably,
they replaced Oboro Shirakube's body
before it was cremated.
They made a crazy toy out of it.
Nomu, don't try to understand what's going on.
There's only evil left here.
I don't understand!
So far, we have cornered him
so that he doesn't take advantage of the miracle.
Why are we here?
Are you hoping for a miracle because of our old friendship?
Have you watched the movies?
It's possible.
Remember Nomu,
who was defeated by Starate in Kyusyo?
According to the reports,
he had his own character.
That creature interfered with strong people.
DNA analysis showed
that Nomu was created from the body of Gromila,
who earned his living
by participating in underground battles.
So, he saved the rest of his personality?
I'm sorry,
but I've already fought Kurogiri in the UAE.
He spoke in a completely different way,
and didn't pay any attention to me.
It could be a test.
Maybe he studied the influence of the changed
or even erased memories
on the execution of orders.
I repeat,
there will be a big step forward
if he speaks.
A moment of silence.
Wipe your head.
I hope you'll wake up
to the past connections of Oboro Shirakuma.
How do we wake up to the connections of Shirakuma, damn it?
Talk about the old days?
Yeah, try it.
What about his family?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
It isï¿½ you.
If you fail,
we will invite them here.
Damn it, I will give his parents
to find out about this nightmare.
He woke up.
Go ahead.
Come on.
I didn't think I'd see you again.
You don't often see guests from the UAE.
The fog doesn't even go away from the look from three heads.
That means it's his real face.
Looks like the locals made a mistake.
There's nothing left of Shirokuma in it.
How's it going with Omura Shigaraki?
Maybe he was caught?
How do I know?
I see. It's a shame.
You think about Shigaraki?
Yeah, I'm gonna have to take care of him.
Shit, it's not an obligation!
Damn it, I'm gonna believe that you're gonna have to take care of such a nasty...
It's not hard for me.
I'm not one of those who rejects someone.
Shirokuma
Once upon a time...
He was a good guy.
He was brave enough to take a kitten.
I didn't look at him on purpose.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Why did you come here?
There's no reaction.
At that time, I was full of contradictory feelings.
I changed my opinion about everything.
Aizawa Shota, right?
Yeah.
And I'm Shirokuma. Nice to meet you, Shota.
Shota, they'll take up all the places in the canteen.
Take my protective glasses.
That way your eyes won't get hurt.
Now we look alike.
That's who I was.
And you always pulled me along.
Is that a confession?
Maybe you confused this place with a church?
You were a joyful optimist.
Always moving forward.
Not thinking about the consequences.
You didn't realize that if you die, everything would end.
We?
Yamada is now a teacher.
I'm very strict with my students.
They say you excluded a lot of them.
Formally, yes.
What?
Hey, have you seen the face of the old man with three heads?
Yeah, I saw. It's scary.
He's always like that.
This time it was worse when he excluded us.
Oh my God, I still have nightmares about it.
I thought that was it.
Well, on the other hand.
Thanks to that, we got better.
Not at all.
You can't make a warning of exclusion.
Because of this, everyone in Class 2A has a mark in their business.
Give you the right to exclude and take back?
Yes.
Sacrificing oneself and selflessness is not the same thing.
If the young people confuse the concept, I will give them death, as they want.
And then I'll take it back and force them to strive for even greater heights.
Please, give me the rights.
Youi is famous for his free school spirit.
I didn't want my students to become like you.
Heroes who devalue their lives for the sake of justice.
After all, the best heroes...
...should live long.
Shirakuma!
If you're still somewhere there...
Come on, let's become heroes!
To the hero!
To the hero!
To the hero!
To the hero!
Come on, let's become heroes!
To the hero!
To the hero!
To the hero!
Brain activity!
What's wrong with it?
It's disorderly!
Who creates NOMU?
Where's Shigaraki?
If I take for granted that Shirakuma's dead body is in front of me...
...then it's for those...
...who will never return my actions to him.
Tell me, who transferred you?
Where did your brain go wrong?
I... I...
That day...
...did you see me and feel nothing?
That day...
...I don't know what you're talking about.
Shirakuma!
Answer me, Shirakuma!
No, I'm...
...Kurogiri.
You studied in Class 2A, Yui School!
We were going to become heroes together!
You're a fool, Shirakuma!
What...
...are you talking about?
I'm Kurogiri.
Shigaraki Tomura's defender.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Shirakuma!
His activity!
Quiet!
You...
No...
What?
Do your best, Shirakuma!
Shirakuma!
Listen!
We are three of us.
Even if one makes a mistake,
two others will cover for him.
N-n-noses!
What?
I am...
Bald.
Sh Whatsapp.
Well done.
Hey, how are your eyes?
They're completely dry.
So it's a hospital.
I think we're closer to something more specific.
Sorry we couldn't help you.
Don't worry about it.
How's Kurogiri?
He's gone deaf, as if he's been locked up.
Still, it's a significant progress.
You used to be students, too, who used to go to your dreams.
And I made you remember the great pain.
I will definitely pay you back for that.
What is it, Nobu?
Why create such a thing?
I don't hope you'll understand.
It's like wine.
In order to survive the juice, you have to trample on the berries.
And I just want to enjoy this taste even more.
I don't know.
All we have to do is not let the victim go.
We'll do what we can.
I hope we really did help.
We need to get the information out as soon as possible.
The hospital doesn't help us on its own, but it could be a starting point.
I see.
Great job.
There's a hooligan in Wakaguma's hospital.
Do you need help?
I'm busy, so I'm going to give up.
What's going on?
They're all talking to me.
About the hero's business?
Yeah, I'm their hero number two.
Oh, cool!
It's all bullshit!
I'm going to buy some drinks.
You want some?
Black coffee!
With milk and sugar!
Okay, okay.
Hospital.
The picture's done.
All that's left is...
A man with a perfect ego and unlimited power.
The same masterpiece that we all wanted to be.
All for one.
Great job, Tomura Shigaraki.
Everything's going as planned.
Even better than I thought!
THE END
THE END
The next episode!
Back to two months ago.
Then, before the League of Villains,
one of the guardians of all for one appeared.
The giant mahiya.
He checked if Shigaraki had become a worthy successor.
We, the heroes, are trying to become stronger.
Just like Shigaraki and the other villains.
Next!
My Villain Academy!
Lessons.
This is a deadly battle.
Go beyond the limits!
Plus Ultra!
