        <pre>The Russian university of UAE. Classes 1A and 1B go through joint fighting training.
Everyone has a third match by winning or losing.
Class A started with a blow with ice to the road. However, Hanenuki's miracle changed the course of the fight.
It seemed that the fight was developing in favor of Class B.
Oh, you bastard!
Don't be angry.
Your acceleration is not eternal.
You shouldn't have wasted it in the very beginning.
Well, I'm going to help Tetsu-Tetsu.
Not eternal?
It was a long time ago, muddler.
Ingenium rips anywhere,
at any moment.
That's why you need these legs.
All this time I was at full speed.
New style.
Turbo acceleration.
It was a long time ago, muddler.
It was a long time ago, muddler.

It was a living legend.
It was a real legend!
It was a real legend!
It wasn't a legend!
It was a legend!
It was a legend!
It was a legend!
This legend was uncalled for.
I'm in control of it to the very end.
It's a bad thing.
I don't want to fight it.
You're under arrest.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm not so stubborn to fight
in an unfavorable situation.
It's not worth leaving food at will,
because I'm going to capture him.
So I'd better hurry up to the guys
and help them with something.
The ice is slowly becoming normal.
He's hiding for a counterattack.
He must already understand
that it won't work.
He's gone to help the team.
What a speed, Ida!
Turbo acceleration.
Even faster than in the Grand Arena.
You were just talking about
your new style all the time.
And now you're working on your own style.
I'll ask him to teach me how to hit.
You'd better look at Odger.
Odger is irritated as usual.
Only Odger has changed.
You can do it!
Why does my chest hurt so much?
Do you know that one block
is not enough to win?
I'm hitting, and he's reflecting.
I'm defending myself.
These hard things on my fingers
are tearing me apart.
You're saying tough things, Gribar.
I got you!
Ida?
I'll take him to jail
and come back soon.
Odger, go to the others for now.
I think there's a mudguard there.
I'll be right back.
Okay.
He's talking faster.
Ida.
Stop it!
I'm just getting started.
Ida!
Stop it!
I'm just getting started.
Calm down!
I won't let the villain get away with it.
I've already missed Hananuka.
Did you see how hard it was for him?
Normal people would have run after him right away.
This is not a place for a one-on-one fight,
Ingenium.
That's what my brother would have done.
That's why I'm doing the same.
I'm going to make a compromise on training.
I'm going to go to battle, too.
You're a mess in the past.
Yeah, I've been told that a lot.
My fist!
He's strong,
that's why he moves easily
even when he's frozen.
He won't get away with it.
I'll give you an example, Tetsu-Tetsu.
You can blow up ice
but you can't do anything about it.
I'm going to break through the ice
with my fists of justice.
If that's the case,
I'm going to put a wall of fire.
Shoji,
the sanatorium is on you.
Got it.
Step back.
Don't you get it?
I don't get it.
Why am I against you?
Your spell
doesn't work on me.
His steel is hot.
But this time my steel
is hot as hell.
See?
Fight, Tetsu-Tetsu!
I broke the spell
like this.
Have you ever been in a melted stove?
Tetsu-Tetsu got his hands
and he won't let go of it.
At such a close distance,
his hands can't turn his punches.
The fire
doesn't work on me.
This is the highest level of steel
that I've ever achieved.
I've gone beyond
my limits.
Take the heat out of your body
and then
go beyond it.
You can do it.
You just don't try.
I'm going to beat you
until you cut yourself off.
Keep in mind
you've got power
that no one can compare to.
Why am I
remembering this now?
Damn it!
Hold your tears!
It doesn't matter if I use
ice or fire.
You've finally become
an improved version of me.
It's your power
as well!
Back!
It's hot!
More!
Stronger!
The heat has broken the camera.
Even stronger!
I can do more!
I'm going to burn you!
I'm going to become
who I want to be!
To the Road!
To the Road!
You're the firepower!
It's hot!
It's an incredible heat!
I understand everything, To the Road!
I get it! After all, I'm Jara Tetsu. There's a flame inside me!
I know it's hard for you.
I doubt you'll last that long.
Arasaka!
You can't refuse me in endurance!
Go beyond the limits!
You won't get away with such a simple burn.
Who doesn't risk himself for training?
He can't do it in a real fight either.
The limits are higher and the limits exist to overcome them.
Enough talking.
I've already gone far, but I still feel the heat.
I'm going to run back and help Jara Tetsu.
I'm sorry, Shepard. I've never seen an octopus in the ocean. I don't like them.
I'm used to being scared.
That's why I'm going to put you in jail and win the fight.
You can try.
Rage!
Octo-hit!
The end.
For you!
Thank you, Odger.
Fingwastop!
If you don't shoot them with your horns, they're not dangerous.
Oh, you managed to get away with me in such a simple way!
I'm going to put her in jail, and you help me with the roads.
Hanenuke!
That's it. I'm taking her to the sanatorium.
I'll take care of my friends.
If you resist, you'll get stuck even harder.
Oh, you!
Octo-hit!
Boat spin!
Octo-hit!
Boat spin!
Thank you.
You too.
Wow, what a spin!
I'm warning you before you do that, Hanenuke.
I won't let you go, even if you...
I don't need you to let me go.
Odger!
By the power of the four of my horns, I'll send you straight to the prison!
If you ended up in jail, it would happen.
It doesn't matter how.
Now the score is one to one.
What's the matter?
Are you slowing down?
Get out of the way!
You're slowing down too.
My head is spinning.
My body doesn't listen to me anymore.
I want to cool down.
But first, I need him to back off.
Get out of the way!
Tetsu, Tetsu, you're going to melt.
Hanenuke.
Damn it.
I'm losing consciousness.
Hold on.
I'm not going to miss this time, dirtbag.
It's hot.
No, wait.
You won't get away.
First, save him.
I saw a lost child.
I took him to the emergency department.
I think people like that are the best.
Stop, villain.
I have the priority of saving.
I'm going to get rid of him.
With one blow.
He said he couldn't handle the speed.
Well, it was a big mistake to leave Ida on the run.
Damn it.
Are we going to lose now?
If I disconnect, the softened stuff will be normal.
I can't even leave something to help other people
like Yoyorozo did.
I'm not even sad about something else.
There's only one thing in my head.
We lost.
Only...
I don't want my friends to lose because of my mistake.
It's all because of my mistake!
Tetsu, Tetsu, come here!
Wow!
All are defeated!
However, they are not considered exiled,
since they are not in prison.
What will happen?
Damn!
My left hand and leg!
It's hard!
One leg strength is not enough!
Forgive me, Todoroki.
I was not enough one step.
Just one step faster,
and we would both get out!
Ida is conscious, but he can not move!
I give up the clash with Kaibara.
It had an effect.
He fought before getting into prison
and helped weaken Ida.
Well done, Kaibara!
You are the best player of the team!
Your
comments became even worse,
teacher Vlad.
In both classes, one person is in prison,
and four more are defeated.
Only ...
Todoroki!
You can not let Shouji take them
and take to prison.
What can I do?
I can not overcome Shouji,
even with all my horns.
Since I can not beat all four,
then all the more I lose.
I'll put Todoroki there,
and then the score will be higher.
But it's hard to carry all three.
They will catch me earlier than I get.
I lose, we all lose.
She took them.
Well, if so ...
Come on.
I'll go higher,
where he can not reach,
and see what happens.
Maybe we will not win,
but we will not lose.
I'm sorry, Shouji.
I do not want to become
the reason for our defeat.
She took her guys Todoroki.
Shouji can not fly
with her magic.
She ran away.
Deku, what is
Klazbe doing?
Probably they have chosen
a safe path.
If Pony throws her,
Shouji will put them in prison.
But why take Todoroki?
If he comes to himself,
then even in the sky,
you can beat them with fire or ice.
So she ensured safety.
But the fight will not end
until they put the enemy.
You're right.
But it will end.
Time is running out.
20 minutes have passed.
The third fight is over.
Everyone has a draw.
This is a draw.
It's disgusting.
It's not fair.
In a real battle,
escape and wait for salvation
is a reasonable option.
Iida
is probably very upset.
Yes, but...
He was so cool.
Since many students
are unconscious,
they will evaluate their results later.
Get ready for the fourth fight.
Chimoki, chimoki.
Todoroki.
You finally woke up.
Here, eat a bar.
Ojiro has already eaten and left.
Todoroki.
We have a draw.
But it seems that I lost.
Well, you had a heat.
Let's repeat.
You can be quieter.
A draw.
If I were faster,
we could win.
Iida.
I'm still too slow.
I couldn't react quickly
to the flexible style of Hananuke.
But you saved me,
although I don't remember well.
And I made the first mistake.
If you worked with fire,
he wouldn't be able to do anything.
I'm just used to using ice first.
No.
You turned into a body.
You are fast.
I'm slow.
I made you worry
with my slowness.
I must become a hero
who gives peace of mind.
No.
I would never call you unreliable.
I will always run.
This is my conviction
as the successor of Ingenium.
To be honest,
I still have to work on the confrontation with you.
Shall we fight again?
Of course.
Guys, if you feel better,
then go back.
This is not a place for chit-chat.
Yes. I'm sorry.
Oh, you were pressed to the wall.
Both classes have a winner.
If you lose,
or there will be a draw,
then you will not win.
It looks like he has a trick.
How did I wait for this fourth fight?
Why?
Because Takagi is involved in it.
Right, Bakugan?
Let's go.
Setsuna Takagi.
Another student of Class B,
who passed the recommendations.
Dangerous girl.
Kachan.
Come on, what?
Seriously?
It can not be.
Enough.
You will see the devil in the back.
To the position and start.
The fourth fight begins.

Early birdie!
Did Kachan's fighting style change?
No, he changed it himself!
Go beyond the limits!
