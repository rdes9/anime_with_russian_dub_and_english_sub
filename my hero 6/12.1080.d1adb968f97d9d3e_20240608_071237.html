Sorry teacher, Mineta behaved disgustingly, punish him please.
What?
Yes, it was just a lucky coincidence.
And moreover, I risked myself to deceive everyone and the rest.
I believe Class B really lost today.
However, in the context of the event, we are not that we lost.
If I knew that I was faking Midori's magic, I would have come up with a plan.
It turns out that if we fight again, it is not known who will win.
And this will not happen, the lesson is over.
After all, at a certain point in the fight, Shoda's magic worked.
It means he touched me.
And it turns out that Monomask copied one of them all.
My magic is one of them all.
These are the physical abilities of many people, gathered together.
The unprepared body will not cope.
The limbs will break off, and the body will explode.
I was afraid that this would happen, but...
If I knew that I was faking Midori's magic...
What do you mean faking, Randall?
I wanted to add one more thing about this.
Monomask, come to Cary's breakfast.
He will come to Cary's?
Oh, you already know how to write?
Yes, I write letters.
Really? And to whom?
To you or Million? And to Deku.
It's hard for me to pronounce such a thing.
So I write in a letter.
How grateful I am!
What is it?
Are you scared?
Enough already! Seriously, it won't work!
Enough! You shouldn't do this! Calm down!
Such things are awakened in a moment of danger.
Well, we're learning to hold on to ourselves.
Midori, is everything okay?
You really didn't wake up.
There is no more presence.
So this is a miracle of the past owner.
One of them is developing.
Do you always communicate like this?
Yes, I didn't expect you to come too.
I didn't expect you to come too.
Yes, I didn't expect you to come too.
I invited him, since he is also aware.
All-powerful!
Did you know that this is a dark miracle?
What if it breaks out?
I also heard about it for the first time.
You say he was bald.
The bearer who was before my teacher was with black hair.
I doubt she knew that one of them contained the miracles of the previous owners.
So you're the first one?
You're a freak.
Don't call me.
Hey, do you know what caused this miracle?
No, if only.
He said the time had come.
Perhaps there is some connection here.
For example, a connection with everyone for one?
After all, one for all.
Originally, he appeared from him.
Many things have a common sense.
I see.
The similarity is obvious.
It's unpleasant truth.
Now, to prevent this, we need to find out about this power.
You're not scared enough.
If I hit harder, it will definitely work.
And when it happens, I'll beat you even harder.
While you're in such a ...
Shhh, you're so fast.
Let's say that one of them reacts to my emotions.
At that moment I thought ...
That soon I will be able to control such a power.
Yes.
I decided that so far it is inaccessible to me.
Perhaps that's why that miracle doesn't work now.
It turns out that if I figure out how to close and open this miracle, then I will first learn ...
How boring it is!
If there is no power, what's the point?
I'm going.
And I have goosebumps from your bum.
Maybe we'll finish for today.
Okay.
So he thinks this power is all for one?
Idiot!
That's it, stop whining.
Well, today you were clearly better than me.
I'm metal, I can stand the heat.
And at the same time, metal has limitations in strength.
And the more you beat, the harder you become.
Each of us is strong in its own way.
Yes, Tetsu-Tetsu!
We have beef for dinner.
Cool!
Class B is here too?
Yes.
Many are going to discuss training.
Midoriya, I was looking for you.
Tadaroki?
Did you also have two miracles?
What?
At the sports festival.
Attack with all your might!
You said those words.
I didn't think you were hiding part of the power.
No, it's not like that.
I think it's a response to my miracle.
That is, initially, I have only one power.
For the first time today, I was surprised myself.
I understand.
I sympathize, it's hard.
I'm sorry I doubted you.
I imagine how scary it was.
Smart and stupid at the same time.
Half-hearted.
And you were incredible, Tadaroki.
I didn't know you were now using fire like that.
I'm not that good.
In fact, we are in the same position now.
Therefore, I will strive for more.
It can't be that you asked me for this.
So, have we decided everything?
I will prepare the documents.
And you will study.
Thank you.
You used to be like Shinsa now.
Do you see yourself in him, Aizawa?
Or do you think about Shirakuma?
Say quickly what you wanted.
I still have things to do.
I didn't want anything.
I just remember.
The bad part.
Yui.
What does this girl say?
I told her that you were a bad part during the festival.
Actually, I'm a man in the midst of the way to righteousness.
Listen, what's going on here?
Oh, Midoriya Togato.
I'm sorry that I dragged you out.
I had a request to Monomi.
Unfortunately, they are too different people.
Why do you think so about me?
So, Monomi?
I was afraid.
I'm sorry that I didn't meet your expectations.
I see.
It's a shame.
Did you want him to copy Prichudere?
Why?
And why were you afraid?
You have the same type of Prichudere with her.
Yours also accumulates.
And I only copy the nature of Prichudere.
If for her you need to accumulate something and release it into the energy,
then I can't copy it.
I see.
For example, for Prichudere Zhurnajivachi, you need to accumulate fat.
After copying, Monomi will remain thin.
I can't cope with it.
It was the same when I copied your Prichudere, but I couldn't use it.
If the power of Monomi worked differently,
I would just tear it to pieces.
So, why copy?
Even if Prichudere works again, it can be dangerous.
Without knowledge of how to use it, everything can repeat.
That's why I thought that Monomi could copy her power and teach her how to use it.
Apparently, everything is not so simple.
I'm sorry.
You have problems because of me.
Because of my power, everyone is always bad.
It would be better if I didn't have her.
Eri.
Not everyone is bad about her at all.
Remember.
You saved me.
I think that's the way it should be.
Listen, it's like with knives.
They are dangerous, but the more sharp they are, the more delicious the food is.
So, in fact, your power is amazing.
After all, one of them all came from him.
Even if it's true, this power will become my ally.
Yes, I will try.
I will definitely figure out how to work with one of them all.
It's snowing!
Clean your mind!
Wipe the towels!
The towels will get wet.
Be careful!
Close the window!
Tsuya can't move!
Oh, sorry, Tsuya.
Let's see the weather forecast.
You don't know when the road will come.
I wanted to take a mango from him.
It seems to be six.
The last day of school for the license.
If they pass the exam, then everyone in Class A will have a temporary license.
After that, I won't have to see your face anymore.
It's great.
Are you ready?
Who is the unfortunate one?
Then let's get started.
Probably the exam is already going.
Will they be able to do it?
Yes, of course.
Daji Bakugov has been doing well lately.
Even though he's still angry.
I'll probably make them a cake.
Great!
The only thing I missed was that I got a temporary license earlier.
You talk like a loser.
Kaminari is a loser.
What?
Kaminari, you have a lot of good things.
Thank you, Shoji.
Incredible catch.
They stole my handbag.
Damn, the heroes will be here soon.
Is there a problem?
Where are the heroes?
It just started.
I think we'll need 30 seconds.
Then I'll go.
No, we have to check it first.
Surroundings.
Take care of the evacuation.
You can't fight, but we can.
Yes, but...
Boss, we'll collect much more by the weekend.
A muddy stream of wallets.
But you got them half an hour ago.
30 minutes.
Holy shit!
How much longer do we have to go before we become heroes?
So what is this?
Are you portraying the heroes?
Get out of here!
No, I'm omnipotent!
These wallets and bags belong to you.
Hey!
Are you seriously thinking that some kind of ice will stop me?
Me?
To get back to what we were doing today,
we thoroughly studied street patrolling.
We spent a whole month for this day at the end of the year.
When there are a lot of people on the streets and there are no heroes.
That's it, just for this moment.
You'd better find a job.
It's sad that your plans have failed.
Sad?
You're just a pathetic naive schoolboy.
What the hell do you know?
Listen, I'm in charge of urbanization.
I live for the sake of bright emotions.
You're much more important to me than you are to you,
going from school.
I'm in a better mood to run away without getting caught.
Damn it!
They turned off.
I just wanted to slow them down.
What, you didn't have enough determination, you moron?
Or did you just want to get hit in the face?
Of course not!
Strong!
Too strong!
Wow, snow and ice carnival!
Girl, come back!
Kill yourself in another place!
There's no better place!
It seems that there is no choice.
The flame wave!
Carbonized water settles when heated.
Hey, what was that?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Hey, what was that?
That's it.
I was holding back.
Are you hurt?
Of course not!
Are you holding me back for being a fool?
And that woman?
Of course not!
Hey, guys!
Are you all right?
Oh, and you're that cheeky kid from U.A.?
Are you trying to be funny?
Are you two trying to be funny?
They were stealing things from the passers-by.
We stopped all the villains we saw.
And what about the things?
I gathered them until they burned down.
Perfect! You're great!
I can't believe you're still in school!
Thank you, thank you!
You'll become the best heroes!
Give the rest to me.
Give the rest to Sliding.
The bracelets exploded.
That's it.
You can't take things from the black market.
You're just incredible.
Thank you.
That's it.
Let's go.
You look hungry.
I'll get some ice first.
I won't help you.
The End
The End
The End
The End
Why is it so dark in here?
Maybe everyone's gone.
You've got a license!
Congratulations!
And here's the art!
It's too big!
Tadoroki!
Congratulations!
Yeah.
Well done, Bakuga!
Now we're going to work together as heroes!
What kind of face is that?
Asshole!
I'm just...
There's nothing to be ashamed of now!
In the next episode...
Finally, Tadoroki got a license from the heroes.
Now everyone in the class can get down to business.
The semester is over.
It's December 25th today.
We're celebrating Christmas.
Next!
Merry Christmas!
But we didn't know...
...that a terrible catastrophe was about to happen.
Get out of here!
Plus Ultra!
