Get ready, Class A! Today we're going to decide who's stronger!
Heroic faculty of U.A.
Classes 1A and 1B go through joint combat training.
In the first fight, Class A's team won.
In the second fight, a collision of Kendo's planning and analysis of the condition made by Yao and Rose happened.
Barely, but Class B won.
And in the end, we have one victory and one defeat.
Class A won.
Class B lost.

Ah Are we going to work?
Okay
You heard her
You heard her
Please
ah
Why do we have to carry the wounded?
In the rescue instructions?
This time the damage is serious.
Not like in the first round.
It's like training at the Heroic Faculty.
Although...
I think it was too much.
Fuki-dashi! Kendo!
You know, but let me remind you to limit the destruction.
Yeah, sorry.
Vlad.
When will the mushroom mushrooms disappear?
In about two hours.
So we'll have to change the place.
Let's take a break for now.
In the second fight, class B won without a word!
Just like at the school festival!
As a result, the victory will be for class B!
But don't be upset, class A.
The difference in our abilities has become obvious.
Obviously! That's it!
Sorry.
He will always behave like that, right?
Why does he do it every time, knowing that he will be hit?
It turns out that in class B there are a lot of monsters.
However, just like in class A.
Fuki-dashi, I didn't know you could do that.
Because that's how the voice comes from.
I had to put up with it a little.
Obviously, it's not just about their miracles.
All the guys have grown morally.
And this has strengthened their abilities.
You write so much.
You grew up on your own.
I hope so.
But far from as strong as I am.
And where did you grow up?
Actually, I didn't talk about growth!
I also came quietly.
All-powerful?
Midoriya, my boy, come here.
Okay.
They are so close.
Recently, Midoriya is constantly hanging out with the All-powerful.
They say he helps with the training since the school festival.
Of course, Uraraka knows everything about what's going on with Midoriya.
I just heard it from someone!
Oh, sorry!
Don't turn the miracle into a fight!
You'll only waste your strength for nothing!
Parakeet, parakeet!
Tell me, have you still not felt anything strange in your miracle?
No, nothing like that.
I see.
My teacher didn't say anything about the sudden reaction of the miracle, so...
I was going to discuss it with Grant Arina.
Yes.
That would be great.
But be careful.
In the fifth fight...
You'll be Shinsa, who took down the remains of the All-powerful.
Yes, I'll be careful.
Hey!
You scared me!
You asked me not to tell you about your business, and you're leaving so suspiciously?
Obviously, you have nowhere to go!
Let's do it without this!
What happened to the All-powerful?
I don't know.
Well, in general...
It worked out all of a sudden.
I don't even know if it's a step forward or a step back.
I don't know myself.
How long are you going to obey him?
I've actually become stronger since our last fight.
I'm trying my best.
Are you taking care of your baby?
Why are you laughing?
You're pissing me off!
Stop it, you freak!
Or not.
Midori saw those who own one of them all.
And now he's going to kill Shinsa, who caused it.
It seems everything is connected.
Teacher...
What are you trying to do with the other predecessors?
I think your injuries will pass in about 20-30 minutes.
Say thank you to your body, which heals so quickly.
And the skin is so tender.
The third fight will pass.
Here, but to two eastern areas than the previous fight.
Great, let's continue.
Get ready for the third fight.
Finally, Tide's turn.
With him, Todoroki, who hits the square with fire and ice.
To add to this speed of Tide,
unsurpassed scouting of Shoji
and the skills of the close fight of Odger,
an excellent team with an ideal balance.
There's Todoroki!
Let's secure the victory!
You're underestimating the others.
I know without you!
Todoroki.
Takayami?
Has your throat already passed?
I took the prescribed medicine.
Everything is fine.
I see.
I was embarrassed at the fight,
so I rely on you.
And why on me?
I'm a stripper and a hard worker.
You and I were teachers in that last fight.
You must keep the reputation of number two and number one.
Yes.
In that last fight.
Plus Ultra!
Full...
...of...
...burning!
Shoji.
You're just a burden.
You're just obliged to learn this technique.
Don't turn away!
Don't dare to run away from yourself!
Get up!
Don't play the weakling!
You were so close.
He had more firepower.
However, he had a raid with him.
The weakling.
He himself was so close.
And you, Shoji!
Stop it!
The one who will implement this technique,
you will achieve what I wanted!
Todoroki.
Todoroki?
Are you all right?
You have a thoughtful look.
Really?
Yeah. What are you worried about?
Everything is fine.
Thank you.
Todoroki's face is always the same for me.
And you noticed the changes.
I have to take care of my classmates
and help them if it's hard for them.
You're so joyful.
However, as always.
Recently, my brother got better.
Oh, that's great.
Apparently, the story of the hero named Ingenium
will end on this.
Thank you.
Are you a brother?
You still need to lead so many people!
Therefore,
I leave this case to you.
Tell me,
will you take this name?
I also have to preserve the reputation
of my brother, Ingenium.
I watch over everyone,
but it means that everyone watches over me.
I was the third at the sports festival.
Now I will show everyone
the power of the will of the recipient.
The power of the will of the recipient.
What is the power of the will of the recipient?
People always treat me
like an idiot, but still.
I was admitted to the U.A.
I actually don't really
think I'm doing anything.
What do you mean?
I'm talking about you!
A bunch of useless guys!
Yes, that's right.
So what?
I'm talking to you!
What do you need?
What?
To compare this place with the Earth!
What an idiotism!
That's it, that's it, that's it!
Vlad said in direct text to limit the destruction!
Didn't you hear what I said at the beginning?
What's there?
The sound of metal cracking.
Most likely...
It's the case of the Tetsu Tetsu.
Tetsu Tetsu from Class B.
A miracle of steel.
The hero's name is real steel.
It turns your whole body into metal.
It can become the best spear or the best shield.
Here you go!
Take this!
There's no point in getting caught.
Get out of the way, Class.
We'll fight face to face to the death.
Did you forget that in that team, Todoroki?
I don't care!
You really don't think what you're doing?
Well, we can dance from this.
You're getting too easy, Juzo!
God, you can't keep us in the dark!
Pony spoke English!
She's angry!
Tetsu Tetsu didn't think of anything bad.
His approach is based on our strong sides.
And you got too easy!
Yeah, go!
Metal cracking continues.
Judging by the vibration, it destroys the buildings around it.
Apparently, the enemies are trying to fight us.
We're going to have a close fight.
It's going to be easier to handle.
Yeah.
Great!
Well done, Class A!
Third team!
The enemy is going for the fifth round.
He's heading to the port.
That's what we thought.
He's off!
Watch out!
You won't get away.
I'll capture the hostage.
Go!
Get out of here!
Let me go!
I won't do that.
All right, all right. Stop it.
I'll take it easy.
Great job, Tetsu.
What about the city?
Almost no casualties.
They probably decided to lure him into the deserted port.
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
What?
You saved us.
Thank you.
No one's wounded?
No.
Take care of yourself.
All right.
Good job. We've been called for help.
We'll do it as usual.
Yeah, make a list of requests.
Thank you, Fuyumi.
I finally...
I finally added Shoto to my friends.
I want to tell him something again.
Ignore my messages.
I've changed.
I don't care about your wishes anymore.
Don't turn around!
Don't you dare run away from yourself!
Get up!
Don't play the fool!
You're moving towards your wishes,
and I, as a good father,
will teach you that technique.
So stop ignoring my messages, Shoto!
Shoto!
The lesson has probably already begun.
Don't you think his shodamania is progressing?
Are you all right?
I didn't know you could catch a cold.
No, I think I'm fine.
They're almost here.
Let's act according to plan.
All right.
It's up to you then, Roki.
Tetsu, Tetsu!
The enemies won't take you and won't show up!
They'll think it's a trap!
No, I'm here for them.
Shodji will figure out what's going on.
Tadaroki will be the basis of the attack.
It's a strong move.
They'll think we're in an open area.
When he gives himself the will,
he's terribly strong.
That's not fair.
Now the ice doesn't block his view.
He worked on that.
No ice without Tadaroki!
Where are the others?
I don't see them.
Even if Hananuki tries to soften his arm,
it won't help,
since she's under the ice.
Now they've slowed down.
They can be caught at once.
Accelerating explosion!
Attack!
What?
Hitting the ice is a weak trick.
If you'd worked with fire,
he wouldn't have been able to do anything.
Hananuki Juzo from Class B.
Heroic name Grisevik.
Magic of softening.
It softens objects by touching.
It doesn't work on the living.
The secondary touch cancels the magic.
Thank you, Juzo.
I've set up a counterattack.
Not on the subject, but he's in Class B
according to the recommendations.
He started the magic before
he was covered in ice.
This speed...
I'd better step back and...
Found it!
I was softening something by accident,
so watch where you're going.
Class B is doing great
with the attack of Todoroki from the square.
Counterattack time!
Hananuki guessed the hit with the ice.
If so, the reaction is fast.
He's really good at analyzing.
The master is adjusting to the situation.
Well done, Juzo!
I'll deal with Odger.
Damn!
Damn, I can't take it anymore.
Kaibarasen from Class B.
Heroic name Spiral.
Magic of rotation.
It can rotate any part of the body
like a drill.
Odger!
What? Again?
The strength of your legs
depends on the strength of the soil.
It's soft under the ice.
That's why it's so hard for you.
I'll leave you here to drown in the snow.
Are you trying not to act as a team?
You're such an inventive villain!
He's in the role.
Now it's hard for them to move.
There are no master scouts in Class B.
But if everyone is gathered in one place,
this minus is leveled.
If the mass battle begins,
Todoroki's three miracles
will be twice as weak.
That's right.
That's why they just have to crush the enemy.
Considering everything,
neither fire nor ice
will strike to the full.
Go ahead.
But then no one will protect the scouts.
Shoji!
I believe that their scouts
Shoji will be in a safe place.
And there is only one place here.
Behind Todoroki!
Tsu-na-to-ri-po-ni from Class B.
The miracle is the cannon horns.
It can launch the horn into flight.
At the moment,
it can control a maximum of four
flying horns.
She has to take care of them.
They are much stronger than I thought.
Tetsu-tetsu!
Don't blow!
The hammer of the horn pressure!
You bastard!
You're cold!
Cold as ice!
You're freezing my steel, Todoroki!
Do you think you can beat me
with bare hands?
Damn it!
Tetsu-tetsu is already doing what I was told
only after the fight.
No, he's not that smart.
Hananoki provided him with an opportunity.
What is it?
Can you just turn around?
Take care of yourself.
You bastard!
Don't be angry.
Your acceleration is not eternal.
You shouldn't have lost it at the very beginning.
Why did I go to help Tetsu-tetsu?
Not eternal?
It was a long time ago, muddler.
Ingenium.
It's going to burst anywhere,
at any moment.
That's why you need these legs.
I've been at full speed all this time.
New style!
Turbo acceleration!
Come on!
Tenya,
congratulations on your temporary license.
Thank you, brother.
You're overloading your engine.
Mom, tell him.
His body has grown.
Can he do it now?
You're right.
But I think it's too early.
Engine tuning?
Yes.
You have to pull out the silencers and train.
Then new ones will grow
that withstand more load.
This technique came to us
from my grandfather.
Thanks to him, the heroes of the Ida family
are struggling to help even more people.
Pulling out the engines
is an incredibly painful process.
So be patient.
If you want to run more,
then...
I increased the acceleration power,
reduced the fuel consumption
to a minimum.
Ten minutes.
At this time,
I will not stop anyone.
