        <pre>The End
I didn't expect to see you here.
You're from the League of Villains, aren't you?
They say it was you who killed Snatch.
Snatch? Who's that?
Let's talk, since you've given us such an opportunity.
I'll do my best.
Don't stress out. I can handle it myself.
There are only a few feathers left, but they should be enough.
Come on, guys, I just came to take that gnome.
I have no reason not to beat two of the best wounded heroes in the world.
I saw the news and jumped in.
You're from the League of Villains, aren't you?
You'll get it now.
Damn, it just got fun.
It's fun.
We'll see each other again, Number One.
I'll give you some time to talk.
And until then, do your best.
Look where you die, Todoroki Enji!
I won't let you go!
It's somehow connected to what happened in Kamino.
Whatever it is, I think it's closed for now.
No.
It's just the beginning.
I want to keep asking endless questions
rather than looking for answers
that won't shake in this dark world.
I want to throw away the armor that I can't see
and protect myself from the wind that blows against my cheeks.
I want to see the sky that Number One pointed out
because I want to see a higher landscape than now.
Burn up your empty, dry heart
and set your future on fire.
Burn up your fantasy.
You told her something completely different.
What, really?
We should have talked better, Dabi.
You only have small feathers left.
You can't meet an unarmed soldier.
We were supposed to meet tomorrow at the warehouse on the shore.
And here, right in the center of the city,
looking for a different one.
It's obvious that he's on a completely different level.
You should have warned me about that in advance.
And I changed my mind.
By the way, I warned you about the test of Nomu's work.
You can make the same claims.
You said you would bring someone random.
Number One is not the best sub-experienced.
Did you think about the level?
I thought you'd be happy with such a serious injury, Number One.
I didn't break the promise.
You did it.
It was stupid of me to trust Hero Number Two.
How did it happen that no one died?
I obviously didn't expect that from the man who said he was on our side.
You can't stop me from being considered a hero.
The more I'm trusted, the more useful my information is.
Do you even know how to think in perspective?
I did it exactly because I was thinking about the Dabi League.
Well, whatever.
As long as I don't let you go to the boss.
We'll be in touch, Yastrip.
Let them take you to the League of Villains, Yastrip.
What? Wait, I don't understand anything.
You were gathering a search team with Grand Arena and so on.
Do you know?
That's what we want, Yastrip.
You have sharp eyes and ears.
In the Battle of Kamino, we had to think about the hostages.
We had to hurry.
As a result, we didn't have enough intelligence data and we didn't know everything about the enemy.
To eradicate this organization, we need more information.
Especially about those creatures.
Can they be done with one force alone?
If we don't find out about the League as soon as possible,
then we'll continue to make the same mistakes.
So, while I'm with them,
should I close my eyes to all evil?
We turned to you because you can do it.
You don't care about prestige and fame.
You can think in perspective.
We think you're the best fit for this.
Old man, forgive me.
I...
Ah, I remembered this Snatch.
Did you even think about the feelings of those you left behind?
I thought so much that I went crazy.
That's great. You were lying there for only two days.
It's good that you managed to save your left eye.
It's my fault. I'm very sorry.
How arrogant. I'm responsible for my own injury.
Can I say that too when I'm hurt?
If you're hurt, then you're hurt.
Listen, that Nomura came right after us.
He showed up and let us come.
Do you think it was an accident?
Well, two of the best heroes attract attention.
Maybe the enemy wanted to split up with us at once.
How sad it is.
I had to do something so that now the world would understand.
By the way, it's quite possible that the rumors about Nomura themselves are a bait for the heroes.
Let's get in touch with the search squad.
Be careful.
If you continue to investigate the case,
then find someone who can help with the threat of such a level.
And you don't care about that, do you?
I'll beat you up, you freak.
I'll come back to work as soon as the wings grow back.
That is, in a couple of days.
Hmph.
Caretaker, will you take a vacation?
Maybe.
See you then.
And this is really necessary.
This is a request.
We believe that the League will not be able to escape if it acts from the inside and from the outside.
They believe.
You say that this is a request, knowing that I cannot refuse.
How ugly.
Yes, ugly, Jester.
Fortunately, you could not get to the stone.
A child? Did everyone save a child there?
So you don't believe in that terrible accident?
Please find that child, urgently.
He has a natural gift.
He needs to become a hero.
Please allow us to help your entire family.
Cities of Secret Investigation.
If a dirty maid helps others live calmly,
I will do it with joy.
I am a jester.
A too fast person.
One day I will definitely get into a world where the heroes have too much time.
I'm going there at full speed.
Welcome back.
We haven't seen each other for a long time.
Why did you let me go for this?
I asked Aidzav to come too, but he refused.
In general, let's celebrate your successful and serious task.
You have a terrible scar.
Guys, you promised to celebrate today.
Dad will finally try to think of a family and all that.
At least don't show hatred.
I actually hear everything.
I'm sorry, sister, I can't do that.
To the father.
To the father.
If you want to say something, say it.
Say? Well, you give.
Actually, I only found out today that something loves Sobo.
You didn't want him to communicate with us.
Don't look there.
They live in a completely different world.
Mom and sister are suddenly ready to forgive you.
And for me, you are still a messed up goat.
It seems that you have changed.
But no, you deny us.
You became number one, defeated a strong enemy.
But I didn't forget anything.
I remember mom's screams.
What are you?
And what happened to our brother Toya?
You changed your views yourself.
And what are you doing only on your side?
It's disgusting.
From now on, I will buy wine with you.
That's it?
I'm sorry, sister, and thank you for the food.
To the father.
Damn it.
I knew nothing would come out.
Shota started seeing mom.
Dad made a compromise.
Mom started smiling.
I thought we could be a family again.
I was so happy about it, Shota!
Shota!
Sister.
I saw Natsuo for the first time so emotionally.
Two days have passed.
Opinions on hero number one continue to change.
I wonder how he is.
He was all in blood.
And the villains ran away again?
They've already caught a bunch of them.
Is it so difficult for him to deal with such a villain?
We hear anxious reviews.
Turn it off!
No.
Understand, he is now risking himself to save us!
Look!
I was a fan of the sharp shooter.
And now I became his fan!
I'm a fireman myself, so I'm very happy.
Remember that guy who said, look?
What kind of guy?
This boy was called, look.
That scream made many get involved in the effort.
This boy?
I hear.
I hear something invisible die.
It's obvious that you created it with your own hands.
Will this be the hero of the effort?
That hero of the effort was very cool.
Yes, he's cool.
But I agree with Natsuo's words.
I can't forgive you for what you did to Mom yet.
Therefore, as the head of the family,
I want to see what will happen next.
I know how small things can change people.
I became number one, not as I wanted.
I worked as a hero with shame and frustration in my soul.
What is this power for?
Why do you have to be strong?
Effort.
I'm sure the answer is incredibly simple.
When he said this, I had a simple feeling in my head.
I thought that we would provide them with a future.
If this is the task of the best,
then where is my future?
It's too late to ask for forgiveness now.
Dad, where are you going?
Fuyumi, forgive me for everything.
I shouldn't have said that to Natsuo.
It's too late, but I have to buy wine and return the future.
On that day, first there were regular trainings,
then one-on-one work.
I fell asleep without even taking a shower.
I had a dream.
I was in a dream.
I had a dream.
Next to me was a beautiful woman with a harsh expression on her face,
and behind her were strangers.
After all, I had already seen this dream.
No, I understood something more.
These are the voices of one of them all.
I can't believe it.
I can move with my right hand, but I can't.
There are two more behind me.
One develops the power,
transmits it to the other,
who also continues to develop it and pass it on.
This is the accumulated power that connects the voices of those begging for help
and the hearts of the brave.
Seven people, eight counting me.
We are all successors, one for all.
I am the eighth,
and the last.
Come with me.
My dear, stupid younger brother.
Why do you resist?
This voice, I will never forget it.
All for one.
Because you are wrong.
I won't let you do what you want, older brother.
Younger? Older?
So this is the first?
What cruel words.
I'm trying to compromise.
What, patience is no longer part of your concept of justice?
Now the whole world is plunged into chaos.
These forces are not for their own good.
And you think only about your pleasure.
I didn't notice at all.
Is this an event of the past?
Come closer.
His jaw has changed.
It seems that the fangs will grow forever.
He is a kind person who took care of old parents.
However, he was persecuted.
He was called a monster, sick.
Even his own parents keep away from him.
And he has no strength.
Once in the evening, on the way from work, he was attacked by those who had it.
His electric shocker turned out to be useless.
He was trapped in a trap made of hair similar to a syringe.
Don't! There is no way back!
Please.
Quickly!
If something happens, will you help me?
Of course.
Oh, mom, dad.
Me too.
I will not forget my duty.
What kind of world are you talking about, younger brother?
I see people and help them with my own strength.
Yes, of course.
You just added two servants to your collection.
I need reliable people.
If you deny me and my actions, then you deny their happiness.
This world has lost its human appearance.
And I will bring order to it with my own strength.
So who of us really thinks only about themselves?
And what kind of order is that if you use others?
You don't even remember how many people.
I will not allow you to insult him.
Oh, it's easier with him.
My brother is so fragile.
Poor thing.
He was born without a reason.
And without strength, he can't get along with anyone.
However, despite this, I love you, poor little brother.
You are my brother.
I give you whatever you want.
You just need to help me.
A choice for those who have no strength.
A mercy for those who sinned.
You didn't eat anything again.
It hurts to look at your sight.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
It hurts to look at your sight.
I won't be the one you don't want to see.
You know, they used their strength so aimlessly.
They created groups.
They interfered with me.
They opposed order.
That's why they were killed.
I didn't give any orders.
My numerous friends love me and did what I wanted.
I'm so happy.
I just wanted something.
They did it.
It's a dream.
Like the world from the comic book we read back then.
You only read the third volume.
You don't know the rest.
The world was ruled by the king of demons.
The king of justice was tormented and saved the world.
Brother, did you know that bad guys always lose in the final?
Dreams became reality.
In reality, these rules don't work.
In this reality, you didn't conquer me.
It's okay, I'll change it.
You're so dear to me.
Stop it!
I found a way to deal with you.
I'll use your body together.
Stop it!
You're the eighth, aren't you?
I wanted to show more.
But you barely got to 20%.
Be careful.
We've passed the point of singularity.
But don't be afraid.
You're not alone.
You're the eighth, aren't you?
I found a way to deal with you.
Stop it!
I found a way to deal with you.
You're the eighth, aren't you?
I found a way to deal with you.
You're the eighth, aren't you?
I found a way to deal with you.
You're the eighth, aren't you?
I found a way to deal with you.
You're the eighth, aren't you?
I found a way to deal with you.
You're the eighth, aren't you?
I found a way to deal with you.
You're the eighth, aren't you?
I found a way to deal with you.
You're the eighth, aren't you?
I found a way to deal with you.
You're the eighth, aren't you?
I found a way to deal with you.
You're the eighth, aren't you?
I found a way to deal with you.
You're the eighth, aren't you?
In the next episode!
caregivers
I am scared of change and me I am one for everyone,
This is a duel between A and B classes.
I can handle one of them all.
I'll definitely get the upper hand.
Next!
A and B classes clash!
What?
We're going to have a special contestant?
And that's you?
Go beyond!
Plus Ultra!
