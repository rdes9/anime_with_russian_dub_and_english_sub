Stop it! It's cold enough!
Damn, why are your hands so cold?
Who the hell are you?
Me? My face?
Damn, who the hell are you?
Yeah, you hold the head.
Shut up, don't let go of the trap.
And take Bubai Gavaro.
Bubai? What's going on?
You can't talk yet.
He deals with Toga and Bubai Gavaro.
With his superpowers he creates dolls.
Now he is busy with dolls in the form of Bubai Gavaro.
With the micro-transmitters of my company and his communication system, he is perfecting the control of the dolls.
We learned about the psychological trauma of Bubai Gavaro from your client data.
What, are you sad?
Agree, very much. We will kill Toga and Vice.
I can imagine how painful it is for Bubai Gavaro.
I can't break up.
Enough! Enough!
Damn it! Stop it!
Toga! Toga!
I'm trying to kill her.
The one who tied the handkerchief to me?
It's me!
Me! It's me!
Me? Who am I then?
Where? Where is the real me?
It's not me. I will break up.
No, I will break up.
I'm different. I'm real.
I...
Yeah, I think I can be heart-hearted.
I had a terrible dream.
I was hurt more than anyone else.
I said that it had nothing to do with me.
I ran away from the sight of God.
I couldn't be your shell.
I can't do it like that.
Holding my strength and weakness.
Now, it's just the beginning.
I'm standing by myself.
Face the world to grieve no more.
The carousel builds up and curves down.
The carousel runs and runs and runs.
Your existence is walking more than the one, the one, the one else.
Ready, go, run!
Pop it, go, run!
Always look at the inside.
I always yearn for you, but I can't get closer.
Die!
Fight!
I want to laugh at you more than ever.
And now it's around.
People were afraid of me because I have a terrible eye.
I'm alone.
I don't have a family.
I understand. I sympathize.
I made my critical misdeeds at the age of 16.
The man you beat up has a broken arm.
He jumped out himself.
I didn't even exceed the speed.
Most likely you will have a record of the lead.
But don't despair.
In life, even if you stumble, you can always get up.
That's just how everyone stumbles in different ways.
Some fall forever.
Jin, you beat up a man
who is connected to our important client.
We just got a call.
They said they would think about whether to work with us further.
Is that so?
You thanked me for working the roof over my head.
Damn it!
Get out, loser, and don't come back!
I was in middle school when my parents died.
I was involved in terrible crimes.
I didn't have any other close relatives.
So I was left alone.
All alone.
I wanted to talk to someone.
Hey, listen.
Did I make a mistake?
Well, even if so,
it's because you're not lucky.
I wanted to be trusted.
And to be trusted by me.
It was fun.
Someone whose life is falling apart
thinks only about one thing.
I want peace of mind.
That's right.
One thought made me make a mountain of mistakes.
And I didn't realize it until I fell to the very bottom.
Then I stopped trusting even myself.
I see.
You went crazy from the sight of how you kill others.
What's wrong with your head?
Are you worried?
If you don't close it, I'll split.
I won't split!
Ah, I see.
My copies disappear when I get a certain damage.
For example, you can compare it to a bone fracture in an adult.
I'm worried.
I'm not worried.
The robbery with your copies
led you to the national wanted list.
With such a miracle, you can take over the country.
Such a man and beyond life.
And what to do beyond this?
To gain trust.
Whose?
Comrades.
Soon one group will appear.
They will definitely need someone like you.
Don't worry.
There are a lot more people like you than you think.
Toga!
Hit him. F, G.
It hurts!
It's all bullshit!
Hold him in your arms.
Break it.
Do only what I say.
Nothing useless.
Damn it.
It hurts so much.
Damn it.
Toga is still unconscious.
We need to increase the power.
It hurts.
It hurts. It hurts. It hurts.
Yes, it hurts.
But I don't disappear.
I always tried not to get hurt.
Because I was afraid to disappear.
Yes, I lived like this all my life.
I was constantly making the wrong choice.
I would have understood everything a long time ago if I had tried to kill myself.
Instead, I ran away, stumbled and fell.
And that's where I ended up falling.
Toga, I'll save you.
From the road of the fake.
I will never kill a comrade.
You will still learn to be afraid of my miracle.
Be afraid of the double.
The army of liberation.
With my double miracle, I create two things from one.
At once, only two copies.
They turn out to be more fragile than the real thing.
Sometimes the second one turns out to be weaker than the first one.
Until the first one disappears, I can't create a new one.
It didn't work. I'm sorry, Shigaraki.
I can do it.
I need data and an image in my head.
And there are no data here and I can't imagine anything.
So it won't work to create Yakutza bullets.
I'm sorry I didn't help.
I'm sorry I'm bothering you.
I want to thank you for what you took to yourself.
I really want to.
I've always wanted to.
That's why.
Get to work, Twicey.
The massacre will begin.
We need to help the skeptic.
Don't kill Twicey.
Damn it.
The process of sadness.
The parade of sad faces.
I'll protect my comrades.
What's going on?
He coped with his psychological trauma?
Mr. Sceptic, I didn't expect this.
An unusual mistake for you.
Mistake?
What are you talking about, Redestro?
I've only made one mistake in my life.
Once in a lifetime.
Take your words.
It's not a mistake.
I'm just getting ready for the next step.
Well, yes, of course, skeptic.
He coped with the trauma?
Oh yes, doctor.
So you need it.
Now he can't stand anything.
And he's capable of everything.
At least you won't have any more advantages.
It remains the quality of Geten.
Yes?
Geten.
Your strength is not suitable for these conditions.
There is almost no ice left.
If you're not busy, help me.
Why would I help you?
What kind of indifference?
I mean, there are them.
Yes, Mr. Compress.
The crowd of Twices came to help you.
We will help you, yes.
Toga is dying.
Guys, are you alive there?
We'll do it again.
Stop yelling.
Stop.
What about the trauma?
Love and courage healed her.
I don't understand anything.
But this is very similar to the beginning of the hero's story.
And you're a villain.
Is it so strange to save friends with a villain?
That's right.
They are important to me.
Sometimes I say good things.
I don't have many friends.
So I value them.
Stop.
Am I stupid?
I do not deny.
You fight better than me.
Got it.
You have a gift.
Let's hit like this.
I'll give you a thousand.
I'll give you another one.
We will not be a league anymore, but a whole prefecture.
For the business of the villain's prefecture.
Wait.
If we beat the enemy, then there will be nothing to fight with the giant mahi.
Don't be shy.
Yes, Bi, go.
You burn them in packs.
And how about the massacre?
How long before the health caretaker wakes up?
An hour and five minutes.
I got it, I'll do it.
Now I need to help Toga.
Find out where I am and run.
Fight!
Is the ice a local feature?
How do you have too much of it?
I told you that I control the ice.
Ah, I got it.
And I control, including his temperature.
I can send water to the pipe and cool it.
It will continue me and freeze.
I would do it right away.
You weigh me.
In the future, to which the army strives, the power of superpowers will determine the social position.
And it means that in order to really live, you will have to enhance your abilities.
Oh, no, we are ...
Nothing will be more valuable than superpowers.
What a sad future.
Die.
You die here, guy with a flame.
Your body is already burning.
The ability to determine the superpowers of the enemy is the basis.
Your skin is about to fall off.
And without it, you won't have to fight for a long time, right?
Your flame burns your body.
With such deadly attacks, you hurt your own people.
By the way, this ice comes out of all the locals.
That's what you need for magic.
And there is nothing to try to cheat on.
If you die there, everyone will be very sorry for one thing.
Magic.
The host is trying so hard that he does not fall asleep.
The host.
The host.
Shigaraki, are you okay?
Asam, I was waiting for you.
If we hadn't come here, we would have been reported and we would have been caught by the heroes.
All options are bad.
Yes, you are right.
These bastards lured me into a trap.
Listen, Spinner, there is the tower.
Now there are more people here.
Their number is growing fast.
Twices?
A whole bunch?
Spinner, hi!
We lost a lot of people in the ice.
My knees hurt.
Shigaraki!
Hey, wait, are you serious?
You have even more?
Yeah.
Boss, tell me.
Am I helping at least a little now?
This is amazing, Twice.
Can you clear the way to the tower again?
They say that's where their leader and Giron are.
Perhaps this is a trap.
But the closer we are, the more enemies.
As if they are defending this tower.
We need to leave someone for the magic.
But the main thing is to kill their leader.
Okay, I got it.
Boss, get some sleep, I'll wake you up.
We'll split the whole army in half with just one man.
Oh, come on!
I'll give it to you.
Giron, I'm coming!
Maybe you shouldn't have taken Twice with you?
No, he loves Giron too much.
He shouldn't have dared to play with people's souls.
I will never forgive the Liberation Army.
Leader of the League of Villains!
It's a shame that we still allowed you to disobey.
Damn, I forgot about this politician.
People are not fragile at all.
There is strength in everyone.
We showed this celebration of rebirth.
How people fight with superpowers and evil.
Blood and flesh are the strongest of all.
It's time to get rid of the honorable guests of the League of Villains.
Let's free them!
Gather your strength!
Clear the way to a new era!
Prove to the world that everyone is a hero!
And that no one is a hero!
The rest is up to you!
His name is Hanabata.
Every word of his makes the locals more lively.
What can we do?
We can't drag Shigaraki any further.
All I can do is...
Oh, is that you?
Is that you, the bastard who destroyed our place?
Oh, come on, you got here.
Where are your hair?
Ugh, bald head.
Excuse me.
You're a coward.
Now I'm creating copies of myself faster than copies of something else.
Because I know you very well.
Pray for forgiveness.
Write in your pants, bald.
There should have been crowds of fighters on the stairs.
However, the skeptic is right.
Your superpowers are amazing.
Listen, people.
You're all copies.
Even if you die, you won't disappear forever.
Don't worry.
I'll dig out graves for you all.
I copied the boss to die here.
Repeat.
We're twins.
If we die, we won't die.
It will be easier for you right away.
No, it won't.
Who the hell is that?
The bald one is ahead.
The commander of the liberation army.
What?
Why are you making your copies?
Oh, right.
I didn't talk to you on the way.
I coped with the injury.
What?
So you're a twin too?
What do you mean?
I'm real.
What?
I'm real.
Shut up.
It doesn't matter.
Now I'll risk myself for everyone's sake.
And we'll all do the same.
What?
See?
He was a copy.
How fragile.
Guys, do you understand the meaning of the word hostage?
Did you see what he did?
Be quiet.
Bubai Gawara, if you make another twin,
I'll kill Giron.
This is not an official League member,
so I don't want to kill him.
Everything is fine, Twice.
Thanks to you, we now have one against many.
We have an advantage.
It remains to take him.
Stop!
Absolutely useless.
It's nonsense that we're fighting in the same ring.
Giron.
Giron.
It hurts.
Fingers.
They really cut them off.
Damn it.
Damn it.
On the right hand.
Fingers on the right hand.
You're smoking your cigarettes to her.
Damn it.
Damn it.
I'm so guilty.
He managed to get the information out of me.
What kind of agent am I after that?
Don't apologize.
Those who did nothing wrong should not apologize.
It's just a fight on the outside.
When there is a goal, such as organization,
unnecessary emotions interfere.
Disappear in front of our will.
It seems you have a worthy dream.
Are you still alive?
You say you have a worthy dream?
It's time.
I'll test you.
There was a woman who gave birth to a child with superpowers.
It was still during the times of strong prejudices.
Endless harassment.
Sea of ​​discrimination.
When people turned against the child,
she prayed to the world in a quiet voice.
This is a miracle of my child.
Please, let there be a world where he will live freely.
Only her prayer deafened the despicable laugh.
She never dared to speak again.
Why?
Because she was killed by superpowers.
I see.
She created the term miracle.
Do you think I'm stupid?
I'm sorry.
I thought you didn't go to school.
So, heroes and villains gained popularity.
The state began to improve the situation.
They learned about her prayer,
creating political measures.
Superpower.
Miracle.
Part of the personality.
Everyone is different.
This has changed the human opinion.
However, in fact, the implemented political measures
have crushed the superpowers like never before.
What's the point of changing the name?
People just avoided the use of force.
And if they are not used freely,
freedom is not real.
Destro believed that his mother wanted something different.
You need superpowers and truth to be considered miracles.
Mother?
For them it was an uncomfortable truth.
Do you understand why Destro wanted it so much?
I laid out a rebellion against the country.
True freedom.
I will fulfill Destro's dream.
I am his descendant.
His blood is in my veins.
I am Redestro.
Do you think some pathetic cutthroats
and their love for destruction
weigh more than I do?
Twice, get ready to soften the fall of Giron.
Soften?
After the first blow,
I grabbed the window
and then I saw him downstairs.
He's already here.
He'll probably touch the tower.
I would do just that.
At a fall of this height,
all people must die.
So you are their leader?
I have never heard the answer.
The kindness I've been hoping for
will someday become the kindness I've been longing for.
If I could connect with you
beyond the distance of one person,
I would see the line
that would never cross again.
Let's look at the flames
that have been cast
by the sadness
that has been thrown away
without any meaning.
It's not a lie.
It's not a lie.
The future from now on
is connected
with the future.
I will save you
who once was
in the abyss of a nightmare.
I can save you.
The next episode!
The villainous league has undergone a counterattack.
In the midst of the battle with Red Estro,
Shigaraki recalls a long forgotten past.
The sad past of Tenka Shimura
drove him straight to destruction.
Next, the roots of Tenka Shimura.
Don't forget
where the feelings that grew in you came from.
Remember their roots.
The limits. Plus Ultra.
