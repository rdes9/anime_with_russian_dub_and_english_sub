        <pre>Yes, I agree, there was too much unexpected.
Tell me in advance, I could work more productively.
You talk too much, you can't keep track of the call.
What are you doing? I didn't think of anything like that.
Yastrip is talking on the phone.
With whom?
With his girlfriend, but not this.
This is a secret.
So many questions.
Just believe me, that's all.
I'm one of them, so I'm careful.
Work hard.
You can't get rid of me.
You called me like that because you yourself know how important I am to you.
If I continue to talk, you will rather think about returning to Chimariski.
And you want to use me.
This is your last chance.
Well, that's it.
You will prove your loyalty not only to the League, but also to the anti-social view as a whole.
This time not with the number one hero.
Dabi called me again.
He still has suspicions about me.
They are definitely following our conversation.
From now on, we switch to the encryption system.
I'll try to tell you as soon as possible where Nobu is.
That's it.
See you later.
You don't usually come to me.
How are you feeling?
Much better now.
Couldn't you ask the old woman from the UAE to help?
She won't restore what was lost a long time ago.
It turned out that people can survive without an easy job.
How's the hero's job?
I plan to leave the shadows soon.
Too many are waiting for my return.
Right?
It's a pity.
I'm a little nervous.
The time has come.
I have nothing to do with him.
The Heroic Network also has no mention of the activities of the League of Villains.
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.
The Heroic Network also has no mention of the activities of the League of Villains.
Something has happened.
It's obvious that now they are behaving differently.
Are you feeling his determination?
The last day of the year.

Both level ones did not perform.

It was all somehow possible thanks to Uraraki and Shinsu's help, but that super power...
Mom! It hurts to hear things like that!
By the way, Mom, do you remember Sherry, the one I was talking about on the phone?
Well, yes. In general, she wrote me a letter.
That's great!
She wrote it while learning the alphabet.
I couldn't help her with almost anything.
She worked so hard on the letter. That's great!
Don't! The neighbors downstairs will think the roof is leaking!
You've always been an all-powerful since you were a child.
You said you'd save other people by getting hurt.
But you weren't very strong.
That's why I thought I had to protect you.
I thought that for a long time.
But now, for some reason, when I look at your face,
I feel calm.
Mom!
And then the New Year started.
Did you take your coat?
Yes.
Look, don't catch a cold.
Okay. And don't forget to wear a mask.
Good luck on your internship.
I'm going.
That's it. It's time to go to the labor agency.
I'm back.
I'm back.
Oh, did you go somewhere, number two?
For coffee. The local one tastes like toilet water.
You can't fly away when you're thinking.
We need permission for everything.
What?
Here, I'm higher than you in terms of rank and rank.
That's for sure.
Higher? Well, I don't know.
I've never heard of it.
Maybe you have the right to receive information.
But...
We need all the calls from this point.
Talks in real time.
What he sees.
A lot of micro-devices are connected to the hawk.
So, we'll find out everything about the heroes.
Warchin, like you, in the best case,
will only look at the hero's network.
But hero number two, the hawk, is capable of achieving more.
I was watching you.
I almost took the black coffee, but I didn't.
I love sweets.
Welcome to the labor agency.
I should have said no.
I've allowed you to go to the labor agency.
I've allowed it with all my heart.
Shota asked me to do it.
But he would be the best.
He's allowed it now.
Shota!
I also noticed on the courses that you have everything.
Shota!
Are you seriously friends with this guy?
However, it is only important for me to see the best heroes in the business.
Friends, you need to choose wisely.
Thank you for allowing me to go to your internship.
The fire hero is a laborer.
He has a frightening aura, but he is a reliable hero.
I was impressed by his strength at the sports festival.
To be honest, I'm even a little afraid of him.
But he has changed somehow.
Will you go to the laborer?
All three of you?
Great! Use this opportunity!
What about my training one for all?
I don't think there will be any problems yet.
Since the day you dealt with these black fools,
new miracles have not appeared.
Since you can close and open them,
I don't think you'll break again.
Okay.
I would blow everything up!
Well, yes.
This is a good time for you, Bakug.
What?
You and the laborer are somewhat alike.
It will be useful for you to personally look at what he is now.
Since you both have the best heroes,
then use this chance.
We will study hard!
On the work of hero number one!
You're not something, are you?
I'm not going to take care of anyone except for something!
Do you want to study?
Look carefully!
We are waiting for your instructions!
Look from behind!
I received a divine message from the universe!
Run!
Run away, people!
The corners of Pluto's lips reflect loneliness!
The time of your...
...fall is approaching!
Well, well.
A bad moment.
I told you to look from behind!
So we have to go after him!
He started to run even before the sound of the blow!
And it's not about speed!
I got it!
I got it!
I got it!
I got it!
I got it!
I received a divine message from the universe!
The stars of evil have converged!
We need to stop them!
This is a servant of the stars from the second district.
He got angry in the morning.
This is the country!
The darkness will soon be absorbed!
He pulled out the glass!
Heroes are dangerous here to wait!
Run, people!
After all, you are the one who will destroy the source of the darkness!
I will take you to clean water!
Come, ambassador of Pluto!
Fiery fist!
You control the glass, old man?
I see that you are capable.
But I don't understand.
Why do you need to do this in my place?
My body is burning!
Guard!
Evacuate the people!
It's time!
And one!
Exactly!
What?
Ah, your trainees!
Yastrip!
Alas, but I was a little faster.
It turned out that the laborers had problems.
Seriously, was it similar?
It was!
Say something!
Well, yes.
I asked to warn.
Oh, I just happened to be nearby.
We are just followers of the servants of the stars!
We must obey!
Let me go!
Let me go until it's too late!
I'll take care of it.
Thank you.
He is the source of the darkness!
The light from his flame will bring darkness and death!
We did it again without loss.
The city can sleep calmly while the fire burns in your eyes.
The light from his flame will bring darkness and death!
Hello!
I am a student of the Heroic Faculty Class A!
Midoriya Iizuku!
I know.
You hurt your finger.
Tsukuyomi told me.
Oh, I wanted to work with him again.
He works at home with my partners.
I have too many things to do.
I'm even ashamed in front of him.
I just found myself faster than you.
I'm not sure about that.
Well, Jastripp, what did you want?
Nothing like that. I didn't want to, but I'm a hard worker.
Did you read this book?
The Battle for the Liberation of the Superhuman?
What's wrong with it?
Well, there's such a thing.
Recently, it has become very popular.
It's strange, but it's predicted to be real.
If you give freedom to several people, you will notice negative consequences in others.
I highlighted the main points so that you can quickly read only them.
As you know, the head of the DESTRO liberation army really wanted one thing.
Society with full consciousness.
Very modern.
I'm sorry for the foggy hints.
I didn't understand anything.
If we get to the implementation of the goals, then we have a lot of time.
Follow me and watch.
So I can only say this.
Well, guess what, number one.
I just want to live calmly.
I want to create a world where the hero has plenty of time.
I have a feeling that something is wrong.
Why does he have such an expression on his face?
Be kind, read.
He is persistent with this book.
It's worth reading.
Maybe it's a secret of his speed?
And here I just captured it for you.
What kind of preparation? Where did he get them from?
That's right, it's time number two.
At such a speed ...
Are you beginning to predict events?
He even handed out books quickly.
Do you like this book so much that there are several copies?
I think they are for distribution.
That's right.
I advise her to all her friends and heroes in the country.
At least there will be works for liberating ideologies in it.
At least look at the parts that I noted.
I highly recommend the second one.
Good luck with the internship, guys!
Teach your trainees well, hard worker.
He's still young, but he doesn't look like us at all.
After all, he's only 22.
He's only six years older.
It's annoying.
Yes, indeed.
Society with full consciousness.
Welcome to the hard worker agency.
We are the burning partners!
Oh, this is the famous burning partner!
Bakugo Ishota!
You came to the internship for the first time, right?
Today you will work just like us, guys.
As you can see, the agency is large.
There are more than 30 partners here.
That means there will be no special opportunities.
Interesting.
We need to shut down the professional belt.
Exactly.
Ishota, don't expect a special relationship.
Even if you are a hard worker's son.
Look, don't get up.
There was a request.
Where from?
Area 37.
Contact the patrol immediately!
They are too far.
I'll go.
There's so much going on here.
But this is the agency number one.
We are either in the patrol or on standby.
We are waiting for emergency calls.
We are working with the guides.
We deal with hundreds of requests a day.
So we have to take up the case as soon as possible.
It's annoying that this duck got into our chase.
Did you call it so sharp?
I can see your mood.
Wait for instructions from the worker.
Say hundreds of requests!
And what is it?
Hatchan, stop it!
I don't understand.
You became number one, and I want to be your leader.
And then proudly say, don't worry about people.
It wasn't like that at all now.
Society with full consciousness.
Very modern.
He seemed to be speaking the opposite.
Yastrip said he thought with a proud smile on his face.
When I saw him, it always seemed like he was joking.
And now the other way around.
At least look at the parts that I noted.
I highly recommend the second one.
He usually doesn't say that.
Yastrip can't say anything to me, but he still tries.
The second part.
The second verse.
The second verse in each part.
They make up the words.
The commission was supposed to receive my encryption.
Although, of course, the effort of the workers was not enough.
I was not able to do it.
I was not able to do it.
I was not able to do it.
I was not able to do it.
I was not able to do it.
Although, of course, the effort was not particularly convincing.
Maybe my hints were too subtle?
Several heroes are in the army of liberation.
The commission does not want people to know about this.
To understand by facial expression.
It's terrible even when it comes to me.
But what did I have left?
Neither electronically nor written to send.
The enemy.
And this is the army of liberation.
They are already...
More than a hundred thousand.
In four months.
In four months.
That's right.
In four months they will make their move.
In four months they will make their move.

THE STANDARD
This is preview.
We are in training with the guys on the road.
We understand what we need to work on here.
We understand what we need to work on here.
We understand what we need to work on here.
It's important for me to learn to control my strength and act as best as I can.
It's not that slow. The main thing is that I'm moving forward.
Next! Step by step!
All this will make me the greatest hero one day!
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
