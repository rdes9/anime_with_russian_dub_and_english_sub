To be continued...
Dear my silly younger brother, why are you against it?
This voice... I will never forget it.
All for one.
I give you anything.
You just need to help me.
The choice is for those who have no power.
Mercy for those who sinned.
You didn't eat anything again?
It hurts to look at your vision.
I will not become the person you want me to see.
In reality, these rules do not work.
In this reality, you have not conquered me.
But it's okay, I'll redo it.
After all, you are so precious.
Yamero, stop it!
I found a power with which even your dead body can cope.
Let's use it together.
Stop it!
You're the ninth, aren't you?
I wanted to show you more, but you barely got to 20%.
Be careful.
We have passed the point of singularity.
But don't be afraid.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
I can't sleep after that.
Midoriya, did something happen to you?
No!
Nothing happened to me!
Health problems again?
Maybe I ate too little cheese?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Maybe I ate too little cheese?
Maybe.
I'm sorry I woke you up.
It was just a dream.
But I clearly remembered the moment
when our fingers touched.
That scene at the end.
Previous looks.
Did you see the first carrier's memory?
Yes.
There were other events
where everyone was involved.
Tell me, you too?
I used to see it.
I used to see it.
I used to see it.
I used to see it.
I used to see it.
I used to see it.
I used to see it.
Then you used to see the other remnants.
Then you used to see the other remnants.
Yes,
I shared it with my teacher
the previous carrier
and she told me about the predecessors.
That's why I understand
what you saw.
That's why I understand what you saw.
I saw the moment of the transmission of the miracle.
I saw the moment of the transmission of the miracle.
But then the first one said
that I barely got up to 20 percent
and something about the point of singularity.
Singularity. He was talking to me.
I didn't pay much attention to that during the sports festival.
But these things are connected.
The carrier talked to the boy himself.
I don't remember that.
And I told you the teacher's version.
So far, only one thing is clear.
You are the first one with whom this happened.
It was not a dream.
Remains.
Remains.
Teacher, what do you mean?
Apparently, this miracle keeps in mind the memories of the carrier.
The desire to do this or that.
The decision to become this or that.
Strength is always born from feelings.
If you grow them, they will become a part of this strength.
I believe in it.
It's like some kind of mystique.
An incredible dream.
Even if we die one day, we can meet inside one for all.
An incredible dream.
An incredible dream.
All-powerful.
All-powerful.
You say one for all worked by itself?
Didn't you get hurt?
No, everything went well.
That's good.
It became known to us that the patterns in the memory of the miracle changed.
But nothing is clear.
And what about Singularity?
Perhaps this is a reference to the theory of the ship's day in the concept of a miracle.
Passing on inheritance, miracles are mixed and evolved through many generations.
According to this theory, the power of the miracle will one day grow so much that it will no longer be possible to control it.
And then the carrier will not stand it.
Still not clear.
What served as a reason in your case?
If this is not an influence from outside.
Anything else?
I remember that I could not see the two ends.
They were so much blurred.
Maybe it's because I'm still a carrier?
I'm sorry.
I can't help you with anything.
However, this power is definitely on your side.
So, continue to investigate it.
Yes, I will try.
Oh, right, about your teacher.
She looks like a teacher.
What, my mom?
Yes, with a hairstyle and other features.
With a hairstyle?
A beautiful woman.
Tell me, then you have a combat training, run and get ready.
Yeah.
I'm also present.
It will be fun.
Think.
Hey, you two.
I see you are working as usual.
Aizawa!
You do not understand!
He came to me himself!
The more you justify yourself, the more suspicious.
Scary.
Well, what are you really?
Shinto, so you went to the teacher Aizawa now?
Kind of.
Hurry up and start warming up, Midoriya.
The day will be hot.
Yes!
Finally, the time has come.
You also do not sit still.
Listen, are you not cold, Hagakure?
Very cold.
Well, you give.
Look at my half-sleeve, right cool?
Yes.
Today is really cold.
All our guys have already managed to modernize their costumes.
Ida, I am amazed how you did not get hot in this armor in the summer.
Even Kachan changed clothes.
What are you doing there?
If you need something, tell me in the face.
Clever devils.
Do you really have a built-in heater in your costume?
This is to keep your hands always sweaty.
Class!
Do not lick yourself.
Midoriya, your costume has changed the most.
You have added a lot.
I'm just developing my wonder.
The gloves fit perfectly.
Although this is the second version.
Hatsume made them even more effective.
Oh, that's it.
Calm down!
Uraraka!
Hey, hey, you just look.
Have fun as if you went on a picnic.
Are we an empty place for you?
Appeared, then.
Otherwise, I'm already bored.
Yes, that's how it is.
Well, I'm in a hurry to get upset.
The winds of luck are blowing in our direction.
Get ready, class!
Today we will decide who is stronger.
Heroic faculty, Class 1B.
Ayusezu Abase.
Kaibarasen.
Kamakiri Toguro.
Kuroiru Shikai.
Kendo Itsuka.
Kodai Yui.
Kamorikinoko.
Shishida Juroda.
Shoda Nirengeki.
Tsunatori Pony.
Tsuburaba Kosei.
Tetsu Tetsu Tetsu Tetsu.
Tokage Setsuna.
Fukidashi Manga.
Henuki Juzo.
Bondo Kojuro.
Mono Maneito.
Yanagireiko.
Rin Hiryu.
You just look at the survey.
It's from the school festival.
I asked people to find out who was cooler.
Our class or yours?
Did you see?
We are ahead by two votes.
From the very beginning you stole all the attention.
But now the times are changing.
Seriously?
I didn't even know there was a question.
And now the moment has come.
Class A versus Class B.
The first joint training.
We will...
Shut up.
Mono!
Today we have a special contestant.
Try not to be embarrassed.
Special contestant?
Shut up.
I hope so, girl.
Let's give it our all.
He wants to transfer to us.
Shinsa Hitoshi.
General Faculty Class B.
Our special contestant will be Shinsa Hitoshi.
He wants to transfer to the Heroic Faculty.
He finally made up his mind.
Hey, he's got a bandage like Izawe's teacher.
What an unusual mask.
Good luck!
He obeys those who will answer him, right?
You'll get it and that's it.
Well, as far as I remember, Midoriya himself got out of control.
Well, that was an accident.
Maybe Shinsa's mind control...
woke up the rest of you one for all?
Or did it just coincide so well?
Or...
Shinsa, can you say a few words?
Come on, Shinsa.
Your magic is mind control.
You can do whatever you want.
You're making all sorts of mistakes.
And no one will know.
Just don't use us, okay?
Everyone says so.
I'm Shinsa Hitoshi.
Some of you have already fought with me at the sports festival.
But one fight doesn't make us friends.
Unfortunately, I don't have a similar sports spirit.
You're already far ahead of me, but...
I really want to catch up with you.
Someone so gifted won't understand.
You were born with a good magic.
You'll achieve your goal.
I want to become a hero...
who uses his magic for good.
You're obstacles that I have to overcome.
I'm not going to make friends.
Nice to meet you.
Oh, that's the mood.
We need to get together.
Just like in the first parts of Roki.
You think so?
Not bad.
Well, let's get started.
Let's start the training.
The battle will be between classes A and B.
The place of action will be the Hama region.
The fights will be in groups of four by four.
Four by four?
That'll be interesting.
Yeah.
There are 41 participants, including Shinsa.
That's a bad number.
How will you divide?
Shinsa takes part twice.
One time for each of the classes.
Otherwise, two fights will be four by five.
That's not fair.
As a result, it may not be fair.
For a team with an inexperienced Shinsa,
an extra person can be a plus,
or a minus.
Here's the situation.
The heroes are trying to surround
and tie a group of villains.
Your rivals are villains.
If you catch the four of them,
you win.
Yeah, villains can cooperate sometimes.
It's just not clear.
Are we heroes or villains?
How do we behave?
Why not stay heroes?
On the base, each of the teams
has a super cute prison.
Throw the enemy behind the bars
and the capture will be protected.
Are you kidding me?
It's better to fight as far as possible
from the enemy base.
Although it's unlikely
it will be so easy.
Catching the four of them
is a minus.
Yeah.
A team with an inexperienced
fifth person can lose
even if they don't
participate in the fight.
So you want to give us a ballast?
What do you want?
Listen, let's make it easier.
It's okay, I'm not offended by the truth.
And this one has already come to terms with what's going on.
So,
let's draw the lines.
Shinsa, draw.
You'll be the fifth in two teams.
Don't be afraid,
we'll do it.
Let's get out of here.
Tell us about your magic.
You're definitely popular, girl.
I can see that.
I'm glad to work with you.
Excellent! Great!
Let's mix the classes with dirt.
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's mix the classes with dirt.
Please don't pay attention to his words.
I'm glad to work.
I'm so glad!
Class B, team five.
Is this going to be his first revenge
against you since the sports festival?
Yes.
I still haven't figured out
the secrets of the remnants of one of them all,
but now...
I can't wait to see Shinsa's new tricks
with his magic.
Where did you get the notebook?
I finally made it
to the starting line.
Let's start at the base!
20 minutes to capture!
If no one catches the four of them,
we'll give the victory to the one
who has the most left.
Oh, the almighty midnight!
Are you going on a date?
Stop it, I'm younger.
Who are you going to bet on?
Let me think.
The class has become much stronger
after going through so much trouble.
However,
judging by the scores,
Class B went all the way up.
Maybe it's because
they didn't get rid of them all the time.
Their development is more consistent.
The classes have grown
in critical situations,
and Class B, who follows
the training program,
will see what happens.
So, the first fight!
What's already in your taste?
Yeah!
We know the abilities of the enemies,
but it's better not to split
and crush them with numbers.
Camouflage, bitch.
You can see it if you know where to look.
Guys,
can I just go
and bang on them?
You won't have time, they'll tie you up earlier.
It's better not to.
Yeah,
your shodzaki has landings.
Her charm is just a waste.
I couldn't get to her
and lost.
First, let's get rid of the most dangerous.
You got it too, Shinsou!
Anyone would understand.
Just like we think
about capturing Ibara,
they can plan
to destroy Kaminari.
Besides,
despite their inexperience,
Shinsou is a big threat to them.
Guys, I'm counting on you!
We need to create conditions
to use our skills.
Thank you.
Oh, you found them already? Where are they?
Shodzaki is on the left of us.
There's no one nearby.
She's releasing her lozies in all directions.
I don't want to
attack the girl, but...
Wrath of Anger!
Kirishima! Suya!
We've learned
that Kodo will start looking for us
with the help of birds.
And that your first target
will be Shodzaki.
By the time you get to her,
I'll be right in front of you.
By the time you get to her,
we would have greatly reduced
our chances of winning.
That's why we decided to attack right away.
I was following you by smell!
Shishido Jurota,
a monster,
turns into a monster,
increasing physical abilities
and strengthening all sensory organs.
But in this form,
he often flies off the coil.
You're not going to shoot
me, Denki!
I've come up with a new technique!
An air prison!
A soundproof chamber!
Great! Get rid of them, Shishido!
I'm coming!
Get him, guys!
It worked!
That bastard...
He's got a different voice!
So his mask...
Those are the second connections.
The voice change.
The yearning is not meant to destroy myself
I have to say goodbye
I cry out to become me
Why? Even if I get hurt
I'm looking for an answer
Goodbye, let's meet again someday
I pray to meet you
The footprints we leave
Let's meet again
Let's meet again
In the next episode
The first confrontation of classes A and B has finally begun
However, class B, which improved skills through training
Starts to gradually push class A
Next, you can Shinzo!
Shinzo's new voice change technique
Controls the course of the fight
Go beyond the limits plus Ultra!
