        <pre>How's it going?
Well, in general...
I'm fighting against the spread of ideology.
I noticed you're handing out one book to the hero.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Let's open one book.
Not only did you read it carefully, but also understood the message of Destro.
Obviously, you're in the right.
Well, thank you.
But I still don't understand anything.
Explain to me somehow, okay?
Okay, it's not particularly difficult.
With such a walking ad as you, the ideology of liberation will spread quickly.
It will be great if we lean towards those teenagers and 20-year-olds.
I will work hard and further.
Listen, Yastrip, you're working hard.
You're doing great.
You're evil.
Work with me.
Thank you all.
So far, the commission does not notice us.
They study the involvement of the League in the events of Deiko.
The troops are doing well.
And we're starting to gradually train the new generation.
Seriously?
What a coincidence!
Judging by that day, they didn't get much stronger.
Well, yes.
They're just schoolchildren.
Thank you for your work.
You can go, Yastrip.
Don't show the slightest signs of concern.
The wings of rage recognize the type of sound by vibrations.
Now I can hear you.
This is definitely normal, Spinner.
Yes, the troops should not fall.
We're about to get down to business.
Four months and bam!
Our Omura will destroy everything.
Four months.

More than 100,000. In four months.
I don't know how many heroes are here and what exactly Shigaraki is up to.
I can't walk freely, and with folded wings I can't hear sounds from afar.
I'm still not sure of any important information, but I've already learned the details, so that's it.
First, I'll give you a sign.
Is it really the Jester who is secretly studying the enemy?
You can't come here.
What? I was just looking for a table.
You can't come here.
Okay, okay, I get it.
If we surrounded this place...
No, we need a faster way.
I know the number of the Liberation Army and its location.
We also need to identify the involved heroes to gather them all together in one place.
Otherwise we'll lose the enemies we don't see.
And the civilians will suffer even more.
So...
In case of our failure...
More people.
Is that what you called me for?
Yes, that way the students will gain more experience with the villains.
And it will benefit you as well.
Please, study them carefully, the laborer.
The commission and Jester already have some idea about the enemy.
They are working in secret.
So, these interns are preparing for something like this?
I doubted that, but I wanted to insure the students.
No matter what, the laborer wanted to take only something here.
And the other two will probably have to work with us.
I came because I have to see the work of the number one hero.
And you will see it.
Kachan, calm down.
I was waiting for something else too.
I'll talk to him.
This internship is to insure our power.
It's a nightmare.
I'm against it, however...
Shota, Dekko, Bakuga, we will take care of you three.
Judging by the day, they didn't get much stronger.
It's good that you underestimate them.
It wasn't in vain that I stole the labors from them.
In fact, they would have coped even if I hadn't been there.
I'm not interested in teaching the new generation at all.
Seeing your persistence, I changed my mind.
I'm glad that it was you who came to my agency, Tsukuyomi.
You are strong.
Your friends are strong too.
You are constantly developing.
Much faster than me.
Much faster than me.
The villains will never get what they want.
Then sakura flowers will fall.
I hope we will all smile.
I will teach you.
However, first Dekko and Bakuga will tell me more about themselves.
Think about what you need to work on and what you can do.
I want to control my power and act at full power.
Your miracle is the power from which you feel pain, right?
Yes.
I already understood how not to injure myself.
However, after that time, there are still secondary things.
It seems that she began to manifest in a different way.
Show me.
I concentrate and release as much as I can.
For now, this is the maximum.
If there are fluctuations, it will flow out more and I will not be able to cope.
Explain to me what it means for you to act at full power.
This flexible force is like a knot.
I want to pose a danger to a useful weapon.
So far I am looking at whether it can be controlled as the power of the air.
Oh, you don't know about it.
This is a long-range attack by air pressure.
However, it requires more power than I can withstand now.
At the moment, if I don't overload my body, I can give out 10-15 percent.
And for the power of the air, it is necessary to give out 20 percent.
So a little is not enough.
For now, if it is not an injury, then there will definitely be a pain that hinders me.
Therefore, I learned to release the power and immediately remove it.
If this happens with these black hair, then I can use them.
However, first I work out a new force in motion and adding a new factor is difficult to lay in my head.
I learn to do everything at the same time, but so far I'm not doing well.
So long that nothing is clear.
He is studying himself.
Shut up!
That is, you want to be able to constantly adjust the force back and forth during the fight, right?
Yes, you understood.
No wonder you are number one.
I watched your fight.
You have a great miracle.
Such pressure from a simple click of your fingers.
From the point of view of strength, you can be compared to the Almighty.
You also had problems with the miracle.
You were exactly the same as we are.
Next, what do you need?
I came to find out what I am capable of.
What a pathos!
Shut up!
And why are you even sticking out here?
Where I want to, I stick out there.
I actually asked seriously, damn it.
So far, I did everything I wanted with the help of my explosion.
Even with one single miracle, I can become the strongest.
Only I found out that I just have little strength to become really strong.
I came to find out what I lack to surpass the number one hero.
Interesting guy.
Great.
Then let's go.
I haven't answered yet.
What?
Didn't you come to learn the fist of fire?
I turned to the methods you used on me as a child.
This is for my right side.
Now I understand that before, my mind was filled with senseless hatred for you.
I studied in the U.A.
The time with them and the competition opened my eyes.
Effort.
In the end, I do what you wanted.
Yes, that's enough for now.
But soon you will reach your goal.
Come work for me after the release.
I will guide you on the path of power.
Just remember one thing.
My idol is the person we watched on TV with my mother.
I came here as an inexperienced youngster to become worthy of the title of a hero.
I came at my own will.
I came to use you.
Forgive me for being here out of convenience.
And I have nothing to grumble about to my parents or my friends.
The hard worker has always been an amazing hero.
He is still like that.
But I didn't forgive you for how you behaved with your mother.
So, as a father, you are a hero.
So, as a father, you are...
Let's see how it goes.
He decided to work here himself, and I thought he had softened up a little.
But it looks like I was very wrong.
Okay, got it.
From this day on, I will raise you as heroes.
Salvation, evacuation and battle.
These are three typical requests to heroes.
In most agencies, heroes are focused on rescue or combat.
And I believe that all three tasks are important.
I know every corner of the city and notice any strangeness.
In case of an accident, I will rush to the scene as quickly as possible.
I keep the Zivak away from the fire to reduce the number of victims.
This is the basis.
Parallel execution and quick reaction.
This should be the norm.
Parallel execution.
They accumulate different things everywhere.
It's hard work in UA.
And here you will get experience.
Get as much as possible.
What you want to work on, get used to the experience.
I'm waiting for the winter.
Can you catch the villain faster than me at least once?
Stop!
Quick reaction.
It's not that I'm in a hurry.
I got my magic at 15.
When everyone was wondering where to put their arms and legs,
I just learned to use them.
I mastered full coverage and was able to control one of them all.
But I had to teach the body to use them reflexively.
Listen to me.
Over time, you will have another six spells.
We need to get the name right as soon as possible.
The escaped suspect turned to the corner.
Roger that.
He didn't slow down.
On the turn.
Stop!
Damn.
Suspect caught.
You're late.
It's hard for me to warm up in winter.
Bakuga, did you notice?
You think I noticed something I wouldn't have noticed?
What did you notice there, huh?
Shame.
The striker used his fire in a hurry.
Do you remember the fire in the battle with Noma?
I think he transformed it into this way of promotion.
I know this because I have the same miracle.
A huge speed at high temperature.
And you still need to control the flame.
He copies my explosion.
And you noticed it only now?
Yes.
It took me a long time.
I'll add something else.
There's a wide road ahead.
I got it.
The striker blocked the way with the fire he scared the suspect with.
Go ahead.
We'll figure it out here.
Guys, he usually doesn't teach anyone anything except shot.
So keep that in mind.
We'll catch up with you.
Fire is like a means of movement.
Control.
You won't work with your partners.
In Kyusyu, we shared our duties with the striker.
But ordinary heroes should be able to cope on their own.
By the way, that day I noticed a hand-made glass villain.
I'm sick of it.
Kachan.
Bakugo, do you want to know what you're capable of?
Yes.
You move fast.
You're good.
But only for the newcomer.
However, you just saw that you can't beat me.
And if you can't handle it, you'll be justified.
This is not a lesson for you.
If you can't handle it, you won't lose points at all.
But a man.
Are you okay?
Yes.
Shota.
Bakugo.
You two will have one homework.
Why do I always get together with him?
This is related to the study of the fist of fire.
Save and set it on fire.
Increase your strength.
You must be able to give out the maximum power at once and focus on it.
Repeat these actions until at least one of them starts to work out by itself.
Kachan, it's like your armor-piercing shot.
How do you know about it, bastard?
And don't come to me at all.
You're already halfway through both points.
Start working out the accuracy.
You're already in control of the ice form.
So do the same with fire.
Deku.
You can release your strength at once, right?
Yes.
Can you do it without thinking?
Yes.
It comes out with full coverage.
But you have to think with the power of the air.
So work on the topic to do it emotionally.
And forget about secondary abilities for now.
But what about parallel execution?
All people constantly do something with parallel execution.
Unconsciously.
For example, a person drives a car.
Initially he did not know how to drive.
Turn the wheel, press the lever and the pedal.
Turn the mirrors front and back.
He learned every step to be able to do everything at once without thinking.
First, learn to do two things mechanically.
When you manage, add the third.
No matter how powerful the force is, the point is to accumulate it gradually.
There are exceptions.
But the rest have to accumulate strength.
Or am I the one who does not know other ways?
Although you work out the same thing, school and work experience are different.
Take the school knowledge and let the body use it here, in the best conditions.
I got so much from the Almighty.
I went through so much while studying in U.A.
As if I was constantly being pulled forward by force.
But I don't care.
Well, what are you doing?
Don't be afraid to fail.
The successes and failures of the three of you will not affect my work at all.
Yes, I'm moving forward.
I'm going forward as fast as I can.
Beyond the limits.
Step by step.
Forward!
As if you were able to move forward.
Forward!
Beyond the limits.
Step by step.
Forward!
Forward!
Forward!
Step by step.
Forward!
Forward!
I don't know what to say, but I don't know what to say, but I don't know what to say, but I don't know what to say, but I don't know what to say, but I don't know what to say, but I don't know what to say, but I don't know what to say, but I don't know what to say, but I don't know what to say, but I don't know what to say, but I don't know what to say, but I don't know what to say, but I don't know what to say, but I don't know what to say, but I don't know what to say, but I don't know what to say, but I don't know what to say, but I don't know what to say, but I don't know what to say, but I don't know what to say, but I don't know what to say, but I don't know what to say, but I don't know what to say, but I don't know what to say
