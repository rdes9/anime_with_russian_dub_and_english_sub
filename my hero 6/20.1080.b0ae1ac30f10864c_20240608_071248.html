        <pre>Great, Shigaraki Tomura. Everything is going as it should. Even better than I thought.
Shigaraki Tomura, we all lost for one thing and now we are very weak.
To achieve something great, we need to reach a new level.
He left us for this power.
Give the order, then I will go and get this power for us.
I was looking for it and finally found it.
So it's you, the one and only heir.
Shigaraki Tomura, we all lost for one thing and now we are very weak.
Give the order, then I will go and get this power for us.
The one and only heir.
Shigaraki Tomura.
Shigaraki Tomura, we all lost for one thing and now we are very weak.
Shigaraki Tomura, we all lost for one thing and now we are very weak.
Shigaraki Tomura, we all lost for one thing and now we are very weak.
Shigaraki Tomura, we all lost for one thing and now we are very weak.
Do we have that power that left us back for one thing, Kurogiri?
Why is everyone for one?
I can't do that!
For what, master?
He's too weak!
Looks like you have some trouble, Shigaraki.
Doctor...
How are you feeling?
I'm fine.
But I can turn into minced meat.
No!
I can't do that!
I can't do that!
I can't do that!
No!
I can't do that!
I can't accept this guy!
In front of you is the giant mahi.
He used to be a bodyguard.
Everyone for one.
The giant mahi is incredibly tough.
And he's able to handle
a few things without any improvements.
Everyone for one.
He hid him.
In the fear that the almighty
will once weaken and overcome him.
A fundamental job.
Everything was revealed
a couple of years after your arrival.
Thanks to your dreams
and willpower,
he continued
despite what was going to happen to him.
I think he doesn't look
like a pleasant gift.
You're careful, Dabi.
The giant mahi is so loyal
that he's now in despair.
He's torn apart
between the former master
and Shigaraki.
Do we have to work hard
to get him?
That didn't help, Dabi!
The mahi.
The mahi.
This is the recording of the voice
of everyone for one.
He's got it there, right?
I don't need it.
Really?
Do you still think you'll get
everything you want?
You've been in Kurogiri for too long.
Come to your senses.
Doctor, what kind of relationship is this?
Wait a minute.
Everything's ready.
What is it?
The old man's making some kind of mess.
Din, come on,
it's disgusting.
What is this?
Everyone used this stone
for one thing.
Where did it come from?
I don't understand anything else.
Now let's
have a little chat.
Disgusting!
Where are we?
What's this?
Nomu?
They're a little different.
It's not for nothing
that I said you were careful.
You're right,
they're different.
These kids are really different.
They're advanced.
Super Nomu,
who's the closest
to the masterpiece.
I was just looking for
you for some reason.
I need the second copy of something.
Your hair has grown so much,
Shigaraki.
Is your father all right?
What?
I didn't want to reveal
my location,
so I brought you here by teleporter.
Like the giant,
I was a close assistant,
all for one.
My name is Daruma Ujjik.
I just came up with the name.
So, Shigaraki,
I brought you here
because of the compromise
that I went for all for one.
My life,
my abilities,
and these kids are all dedicated
to the great all for one.
You relied on small pieces
of everything
not because I didn't like it,
but for my own good.
I want to make sure
that you deserve
my full self-reward.
What can a 20-year-old
7-year-old
who hasn't achieved
anything yet
do, Shigaraki Tomura?
Don't, Tenko!
I don't really remember
what happened
before I met you and the teacher.
Yeah, I know.
And at the same time,
when I put on
everyone's clothes,
I'm filled with rage.
I've been thinking about it
for a long time.
Since that very day.
What?
No one's helping, huh?
It's a shame, isn't it?
Shimura Tenko,
I see you're scared.
You're in pain.
You probably ran away
to find help.
It's so terrible.
The hero will help.
Sooner or later, the hero...
That's what they all think
and pretend they don't see you.
Who turned our world
into such a place?
Now everything will be fine.
After all, I'm with you.
My memories
begin with the teacher's abduction.
And since then,
I've been empty.
I'm sorry it's so cramped here,
but now it's your room.
From now on,
I'll be your teacher.
Teacher?
What are you going to teach me?
Doctor.
Yes, I'll bring it.
That's all that's left
from your family.
You're a kind of mutation.
You didn't know about the existence
of such a miracle,
and you broke your whole family
on her nerves.
Do you remember?
At that moment,
my mind was filled
with scattered pictures.
I felt a disgusting
and unclear irritation.
Will you take care of them?
No.
That's all.
Those feelings live in your soul.
I want to teach you
how to direct these feelings,
including
this irritation.
When I put them on,
it's so strange.
It becomes terribly stuffy in my head.
But at the same time,
my heart calms down in its own way.
It's strange, isn't it?
You only have those scattered pictures.
At the same time,
a heavy burden
is sinking in my mind.
From there, I feel angry
endlessly.
I never have peace.
Even if
the society of heroes fell,
even if I ruled
from the shadows,
this heaviness wouldn't disappear.
Yes.
Apparently, I have to hate everything.
Everything that breathes
irritates me wildly.
Then let everything collapse.
Then you will see
the most beautiful horizon
on the entire planet.
Help me, doctor.
I will show you
everything, from heaven to hell.
Well, you've set up
the air castles.
I'm not so indignant about them yet.
Why not?
I will help you,
Shigaraki T≈çmura.
I will try.
You're a villain.
You're the one who makes up
all kinds of nonsense.
I didn't know that you thought
about such dangerous things.
And you will also destroy
what I like.
I take into account the desire of my comrades.
Live as you want.
Hooray!
You're even worse than I thought,
Shigaraki.
I was going to work with you
from the very beginning.
I prepared some strength for you.
However,
I will not give it to you now.
Your guys are too weak.
First,
reach the minimum possible level.
That guy is pretty simple.
And unlike me,
he denies you with all his heart.
Go and try to fix
yourself a giant mahi.
Then I will be ready
to devote myself to you.
If you need it,
do it yourself.
Yeah,
we had a very long
consultation.
I will not help.
It's just that your flame does not work on him.
Go away, psychopath.
I just want to go now
and bring us a good ally.
Is it coming?
Come on, I'm counting on you.
Let Dabi help me
with the advanced tests.
Besides, they have a similar
aesthetic taste.
They will work.
Did you hear me at all?
Then bring us back.
I suddenly caught fire.
Now you will use this
to communicate with me.
Come on,
little John.
Send the guys to the giant mahi.
Oh, master.
Hello.
Your future
king is back.
Slabak!
There is only a chance in the air.
Slabak!
The future king is in trouble.
We have nothing new.
To make Dr.
Ujjik cooperate with us,
we need to somehow
pacify the giant mahi.
It's been a month and a half
and the giant mahi
is still against
Shigaraki.
He continuously attacks
for 48 hours
and 44 minutes.
Then he falls back
for about three hours
and starts the fight again.
His body grows
during the fight.
And the giant mahi
always finds Shigaraki
wherever he is.
During these months,
Shigaraki didn't sleep well.
His life is in the hands
of a huge creature,
and for some reason he smiles.
If we ran away
from the battlefield,
he didn't chase us for a long time.
After all, his only goal
is the heir to the master,
Shigaraki.
Therefore, everyone, except Shigaraki,
is resting leisurely.
We dedicated ourselves
to Shigaraki,
and he provided us
with minimal funding.
It took a long time
and I bought myself
a special jacket.
It's comfortable.
When I'm cold,
I move slowly.
I love the trapezoid silhouette.
You're here
because of your love for Shigaraki,
and you don't indicate
that he's still in the league.
I love the tongue.
I love the eye.
I love that I can love so many people.
What freedom!
He finally fell asleep.
Does this creature ever eat?
Tomura, are you alive?
Yes.
He barely moves.
I think I'm closer to the goal.
I swear,
Tomura is bowing to me.
He looks like a young man
chasing his dream.
Oh, it's Giron.
I called him so many times,
but he never picked up the phone.
Ask him about the insurance.
He's worried about me,
although he's already introduced me to the League of Villains.
He's so good.
Hey, why don't you answer the phone?
Mr. Compress, huh?
Well, what a creature you are!
Well, it's because of us,
and he's not guilty of anything.
You are Din Bubaygavora.
The villain's name is Weiss, right?
The voice mask?
Who is it? Where's Giron?
Can you turn on the news right now?
Urgent news.
As yesterday, another finger was found today.
Finger?
Previous ones were found in the house of the head of the group of villains
of the 8th covenant of death.
In the Khosu airport,
on the Tuyo highway,
and in the epicenter in the Kamino district.
A new finger was found
in the center of Fukuoka.
These are all the places where we visited with you.
Who the hell are you?
I am the supreme leader of the Liberation Army.
Red Estro.
First Yakuza,
now the Liberation Army.
This is some kind of retro boom.
They say you sold a lot of books.
You shouldn't investigate
for this interference.
On the contrary,
it was us who caused the interference.
What about Giron?
And what do you need?
He's a great guy.
Well, your man is here.
He's alive, of course.
We want to free the superpowers,
lower the current cost
and set up a world
where people will be people,
and the abilities will be used
100%.
But this is not in line with our goals.
They want to cover with our name again.
Let the agent go
and call back later.
We are very busy now.
When we sort it out here,
I will listen to you.
Well, then, have a rest
and listen.
First of all, I will not let him go.
Now he is a hostage.
I heard you are all very united there.
And the guy deserves respect.
Such a strong
labor discipline.
He must have been hiding in the dark,
considering the all-seeing eye
of the heroes and the police.
Therefore, he was persecuted
from the same dark.
It is worth praising him.
After all, he managed to get rid
of the list of clients.
He did not give anything out
and handed over a single stone,
even when his fingers were cut off.
And then we restored
the deleted data.
Let's praise him for the defense resistance.
We, the soldiers of the liberation army,
were preparing for the coming day.
We have endured
for generations.
We have endured.
Let the roots be prepared.
A circle of rebels?
I don't like such jokes.
There are 160,560 soldiers
hidden all over the country.
We are ready
to make our move.
Are you kidding?
It's not bad, is it?
Why are you somewhere in the mountains?
It's late.
We have already brought a satellite camera
to you.
Wherever you go, we will find out.
We will find you,
wicked villains.
Remember about Staratele,
Yastrebe,
Mureka,
and Korya.
If we tell them about you,
they will rush.
The liberation army
is supposed to be destroyed.
You guys have managed to get famous.
We will crush you
and thus announce
the revival of the liberation army.
Our fingers were only sworn.
We don't need
all sorts of pitiful negotiations.
Very soon
we will start the battle
for the liberation of the superhuman.
Come to Aichi,
in the city of Deiko, in an hour.
I will let Giron go,
and then you have to choose.
You will fight us and fall,
or you will be caught by the heroes
and you will fall.
Decide, Shigaraki Tomura.
Do we have to get to Aichi in an hour?
He has his own satellite camera.
Yes, it's terrible.
We were made.
What to think about here?
Nothing. The scarf looks like guts and round glasses.
Only he has such a bad taste.
Thanks to Giron,
I found my place.
We need to save him now.
He could already be killed.
It could all be a lie.
After all, he was just talking.
If there is at least some chance, you have to go.
Without thinking about the weather,
go away.
Since when are you so involved with friends?
So I'm a scoundrel.
I came up with something.
Doctor, are you listening?
Yes.
I didn't know that the Liberation Army
is still somewhere around.
I see you really got angry.
I'm upset.
How long until we wake up the healthy man?
If everything is as usual,
then two hours and thirty-five minutes.
Doctor,
where is Dabi?
Well, now he is
on the border of Miyo and Shige.
Great place.
Okay, we need a transfer.
Okay, let's go.
What if they are right?
A hundred or more thousand.
The giant of magic is invincible.
I've been fighting him for a month
and I know it.
He lost a lot of health points.
Wherever I am,
the giant of magic will find me
and come.
I'll throw this gromila
at those 100,000 people
and let them fight.
Even a big guy like him
will get tired after that.
You're so cunning.
What will you do if you get caught?
There will be one dead fool.
You'll go anyway.
I said so.
Okay, now I'm alone.
I'll wipe them out.
The kindness
that I've been hoping for
will become
the kindness
that I've been waiting for
one day.
If I'm connected
with you
I'll see the line
that will never come again.
The meaningless
that someone tells me
and the sorrow
that was thrown away
I'll see
the fire
that was put out.
It's not a lie.
It's not a lie.
The future
from now on
will be connected
to you
no matter where you are.
I'll see the line
that will never come again.
It's not a lie.
It's not a lie.
The future
from now on
will be connected
to you
no matter where you are.
It's not a lie.
The future
from now on
will be connected
to you
will fight for the freedom of the monster
by eliminating the current social conditions.
Their Supreme Commander Redestra is going to destroy the League of Villains
and create a new society.
Together with 110,000 soldiers,
he is starting an exuberant party.
Next is the Day of Rebirth.
Evil will fight against evil.
Go beyond the limits, plus Ultra!
