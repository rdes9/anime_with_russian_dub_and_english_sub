D-Mail
So, where are you?
If you lie here, you will get a heat stroke.
You sleep on the roof of the laboratory yourself.
Besides, it's cloudy today. Did you see Mayuri?
Hashida said that he had not found her at Komimi.
Yes, I met her after that.
Clear?
Listen, Okabe.
What?
Clear.
Hey!
It's raining.
What's going on?
Couldn't you have warned me earlier?
I was soaked to the last thread.
I told you.
It's your own fault that you didn't listen.
You pervert!
It's nothing like that. I didn't mean to spy on you.
And you don't have to wear such thin clothes.
I just forgot that you are such a pervert.
Who dared to look at your fat face?
If you say anything more, I'll put your brain in a flower pot.
Hey, what kind of threats are these?
Don't come near me!
And what is this?
Did you break somewhere while I was looking for you?
Rascal!
I treat myself like a mad scientist.
Come on, come on.
You're such a pervert.
Give it to me.
I have a sewing set with me.
I'll sew it up.
Sewing set?
I think I'm more oriented to a different family than most people.
Come on, take it off.
And for clarity, it's dark here, so don't wait too long.
And get ready for the fact that you will find out the color of the thread after we leave here.
Black, red or pink.
The probability is one to three.
I will pray that I don't get pink.
Don't sit down.
Don't worry.
I'm not interested in such a sharp body.
I warned you, it's a flower pot.
Damn.
Where did you find out that you tore off such clothes?
Today I was in the laboratory.
In the laundry room.
On the streets.
And then.
In your hotel.
Hotel?
Why?
It's all because of you.
You didn't answer the phone.
You didn't answer the phone.
No way.
You were worried about me.
I'm the head of the laboratory.
I'm the master of the lab.
This is my job.
You're not ready yet?
Wait a minute.
Here.
Damn.
Come on.
I'm not interested in such a sharp body.
I'm not interested in such a head of an insane scientist.
Hey, it's somewhere here, isn't it?
The place where I was killed.
How did you know?
More desperate.
Too real to be a dream.
Kurisu.
Wait.
Do you want to say?
I have sad memories.
Weak.
Almost unreachable memories.
Not just about the murder.
I still remember you.
Sad.
In what despair were you saving Mayuri?
How did you continue your attempts?
Despite the struggle and loneliness.
You did not return to the original lines.
But continued to try.
Continued to call her.
Continued to cry.
Repeated attempts to save her.
Every time I saw your face.
I thought about how important she was to you.
And maybe someone is really.
Someone else cares so much about someone else.
That's why I wanted to work with you.
That's why I wanted to help you.
Hey, Okabe.
Save Mayuri.
You have to save her.
If we return to this line.
You will die.
But this is the only way.
You better understand it all.
There is only one way.
You.
You tell me to leave you.
Is there another way?
Since yesterday, I think.
Maybe there is some other way.
Can't we do something else?
But during this time.
I did not find an answer.
Except for returning to this line.
Okabe!
Okabe!
I refuse to accept this.
I do not give up.
I can not.
I can not leave Kurisu.
I can not live knowing when she will die.
This can not be.
I.
I.
You can run away.
You can run away, but it will only get worse.
Shut up!
It does not matter how many times you move.
It will not exceed one percent barrier.
We will not find out if we do not try.
You will just see how Mayuri dies.
Again.
It will break you.
It will break you.
It will break you.
It will break you.
It will not break.
It will not happen.
How many times have I seen her death?
I saw her again.
And again.
And again.
And again.
And again.
It did not break me.
The amount does not matter.
Do you hear yourself?
Mayuri will suffer and die.
How can you say that it does not matter?
If it does not touch you.
So your heart is already broken.
Stop.
Otherwise it will break you.
I know.
And for a long time.
It does not matter how many times Mayuri died.
I stopped being surprised.
I am more fervent.
I do not even notice it.
Sometimes before the jump I was just waiting for her death.
Just to find out the time.
And once.
It just stopped touching me.
In the depths of my soul I calmly told myself that I could stop it.
Save Mayuri.
If you do not save her, it will kill you.
If you give Mayuri to die, then you will regret it.
We went so far with one desire to save her.
If we stop, we will regret it all our lives.
But if we save her ...
I'll just go back to the original world line before sending the e-mail.
It will be better for me and for you too.
Mayuri.
How many times have we argued over these 12 days?
It was always fun.
To discuss our problems.
When I was driven into a corner, I turned to Kurisu.
Kurisu was the one who listened to me, believed in me.
I was Kurisu.
A genius who was published in the Academy newspaper at the age of 18.
Always calm and decisive.
So proud and curious.
But at the same time kind and cute.
Her theories constantly amazed me.
And I remember every word she said.
Every move she made.
She is not just a member of the laboratory.
For me, Kurisu Makise ...
I ...
I can't save you.
I'm sorry.
Thank you.
Thank you.
For worrying about me.
Why should it be you?
Why you?
Hey, what does it mean to change the world line?
What if you go from here to the beta line?
You just disappear from this world.
Maybe you will change places with that Macabre?
No matter how it is.
It doesn't matter.
It's not like that.
And I will not die.
Even if I die in the beta line.
This does not mean that I will die here.
There is another me.
On endless world lines.
And our minds are connected and make up me.
Do you like it?
Don't you think it's great?
To be everywhere.
In every moment.
In one place.
To love someone.
To believe in something.
To wish for something.
If all this exceeds time and creates you.
Isn't it great?
So don't think that you're leaving me.
Even if the world line changes.
Until you remember me.
I exist.
So.
I will never forget you.
I will not forget the one who is the most indifferent to me.
So.
So it is.
But it's so unexpected.
I love you.
What about you?
What are you talking about?
I want to know your answer.
What do you feel about me?
Do you want to know?
Yes.
Your face.
Close your eyes.
Why?
Don't ask, just close them.
Actually, I didn't want to do it.
I see.
But impressions like your first kiss are stored in the hippocamp with strong memories that are difficult to forget.
So.
Then it's all in vain.
It was not my first kiss.
The actor is a return girl.
Shut up, girl.
My first kiss was not so romantic at all.
So.
In general.
The impressions from this are too weak.
One more time.
I don't want to forget it.
So I'll take care of the fixation.
Okay?
I think there is nothing wrong here.
Just kiss.
Time flies so fast.
Time flies so fast.
Now I feel like Einstein.
You know, Akabe.
Time flies so fast or slow.
It depends on how you feel it.
The theory of relativity is so romantic.
And at the same time so sad.
So.
Are you sure you don't want to say goodbye to my Reidaro?
Any extra escort will only make it worse.
And if you're the only one, I can leave Japan without any problems.
I'm kidding.
A gift.
Catch it.
Thank you.
I upgraded it to version 2.67.
I'm so happy.
But I'll still take it.
Bye.
Kurisu, are you sure?
This is for you.
Why are you shaking so much?
Take it.
Okay.
Akabe.
I'm sure no matter how it turns out, you will suffer.
Only you will remember me.
In that world.
And no one else.
You care about your friends more than anyone else.
That's why it will hurt you a lot.
I'm sorry.
But in some sense, I'm happy with this pain.
To be in the lab.
Or when you drink a bottle of lemonade.
Or when you walk around the city.
Or when you kiss someone.
Let it not be every time.
Let it be once in a hundred times.
I would like you to remember me.
Because I was there.
I was there, behind the 1% barrier.
Akabe.
Akabe.
Okabe.
Akabe.
Akabe, I found it!
That's it!
If we remove this, the mission is completed.
Akabe, are you okay?
I'm fine!
Now we start the final stage of the vernal operation!
The victory is near. We have overcome all the enemies.
We were devoted to our ideals to the end.
And in the end, we entered the battle for Ragnarok.
I express my gratitude to those who worked hard with me to win.
I am grateful to all those who I sacrificed what will be in the world, what I want.
This is all a choice, Bratsteiner!
The world will be restored!
I'm sorry.
Akabe!
Akabe!
Akabe!
I love you too!
Bratsteiner!
I love you too!
Akabe!
Mayuri?
Hmm?
Who is Laborant number 004?
004?
Hmm...
We don't have such a number.
So!
The battle for Ragnarok is over!
I, the mad scientist and chemist Akabe, control the time!
I broke the plans of the organization of the Excerpt and achieved complete victories!
The structure, which ruled the world, is defeated and the future chaos is postponed!
This was the choice of Bratsteiner!
Akabe!
Everything is fine!
What are you saying?
I just received a declaration of freedom!
You don't have to say that anymore!
Is everything all right with Mayusha now?
So, Akarin, you can cry about yourself.
We don't need a microwave phone anymore.
Because of him, I met Kurisu.
But because of him, so many people were hurt.
Just like the dead chemist Akabe, the microwave phone and phone must disappear.
It doesn't mean that life should burn down.
This is for the best, isn't it, Kurisu?

Who is it?
Dad?
Whose?
Akarin?
Akarin!
The spell girl wants to talk to you!
Who is it?
Please, come to the roof of the radio station now!
Who are you?
I arrived from 2036.
I'm Hashi Daetaru's daughter.
Amane Suzuka.
Suzuka?
Wait a second!
Suzuka!
What are you doing here?
Please, believe me.
You have to prevent the Third World War!
The End
