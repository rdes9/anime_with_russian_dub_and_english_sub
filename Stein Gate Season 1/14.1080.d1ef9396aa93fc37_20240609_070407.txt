After that, I duplicated myself over and over again, trying to save Mayuri, but no matter what I did, Mayuri died.
Even if there was no Mayuki and Serna, it would seem that fate itself continued to kill her, as if it was the end of the world.

The cars are not moving. The trains are stopped. Hurry up! Go around the traffic jam!
It's impossible.
What? My watch is stuck.
Strange, I recently started them again.
Again?
Mayuri!
Only Shino Mayuri died.
Akabe, that is, Akabe Renter was captured.
What am I supposed to do?
What am I supposed to do?
No matter how hard I tried, she died.
This is not a world of us.
I see, this is...
That can't be!
Kikuno! Steinsteiner's Gate!
And fate!
They do not exist!
No!
Steinsteiner's Gate!
And fate!
And fate!
And fate!
And fate!
And fate!
And fate!
And fate!
And fate!
And fate!
And fate!
And fate!
And fate!
And fate!
And fate!
And fate!
And fate!
And fate!
And fate!
What are you talking about?
Explain!
I went to the end of a personal character.
I better save it, or I'll do it myself.
Of course! Bye!
Mayuri has already left.
Already left?
Mayuri has already left.
Mayuri has already left.
Paranormal
Mayuri has already left.
Everything repeats!
No matter how much I tried to save her, in the end, even the message is the same.
Message.
I have new information about the time machine. I wanted to talk to you alone.
Don't move. Raise your hands.
Who the hell are you?
I'm replying to the Ark. I know that you are planning to attack the laboratory and kidnap us.
Where from? Because I'm from the future. Do you understand? Now answer.
Sotova.
No.
Now answer.
Do you work for the sector?
No.
Do you understand? Now answer.
Sotova.
No.
Now answer.
Do you work for the sector?
Not quite.
Not quite?
Our goal is to return IBM 5100.
But you stole it.
I don't know anything.
Don't pretend.
You sent an e-mail.
I see. The reality has changed. And now she doesn't remember it.
Why do you want to attack the laboratory?
There is no more IBM 5100.
Too late.
Answer.
Three reasons.
First.
You found out what you shouldn't have known.
Second.
You created a time machine.
Third.
You wanted to publicly declare this.
You knew all this.
And CERN knows?
I obey FB.
FB?
Is this a division of CERN?
FB is everything to me.
Where am I?
Don't move.
Are you John Titor?
John Titor.
You are the only one who can be him.
Titor!
Where am I?
The threat of an explosion has stopped the train.
As planned.
Capture Kurisu Makisa and Hashi Daitaro.
No one else is needed.
Stop!
Wait!
Please, don't kill Mayuri!
I'm sorry.
I was wrong.
I never wanted to fight against CERN.
I'll give you a time machine.
I'll never tell anyone.
Start the operation.
Please, I'll do anything.
I'm sorry.
It was just curiosity.
It was a game.
So...
Spare Mayuri.
It's too late.
Mayuri!
Mayuri!
Shut up!
Mayuri!
Mayuri!
What happened?
Did you fall asleep?
Again.
I can't do it anymore.
Akabe!
What happened?
You don't have to destroy it.
We decided not to carry out the experiment.
What did you find?
Are you going to the store to buy something for the party?
Party...
Wait, Akabe!
It's a high-speed train.
No, it's a white high-speed train.
Akabe!
Akabe!
Where is Mayuri?
Mayuri has already left.
I know.
She came to invite you to the party.
And now she went to her cosplay friend.
After that, she's going to the party.
I know everything!
I'm sorry.
But I...
But I...
What are you doing here?
Kurisu.
You called me by my name for the first time.
What happened?
No, what should happen?
You doubled yourself, didn't you?
It's all...
It's all my fault.
Akabe.
It's all my fault.
I shouldn't have persuaded Daru to hack the core.
I shouldn't have asked Daru to finish the time machine.
I shouldn't have invited Mayako to the lab.
It's all my fault, Mayuri.
You're going too far, idiot.
We don't know how safe the time machine is.
You could have lost your existence.
At the basic level, people are temporary creatures.
Heidegger, I just wanted to say that.
I learned this phrase from you.
It's a little creepy.
As if you looked into my head.
But it seems to me that these are the usual consequences of duplication.
What should I do?
How long will they attack the lab?
After 730.
I can name a few reasons leading to her death.
But we don't have time to chat.
Let's go.
Mayuri is very dear to me.
I want to save her too.
I'm sorry.
Don't apologize.
I want to help you.
I owe you...
Hey, you crazy scientist.
You're going to change the world, aren't you?
Of course!
Right?
I set the time for 5 hours ago.
At the time the time machine was completed.
If you go further, it may not be completed.
You go back in time.
As soon as the time machine is ready, send everyone away and tell me what we talked about.
If you say that you are from the future, I will surely believe you.
How do you know?
I know myself well.
I built this machine myself.
Everything will work out.
Are you sure about that?
I think so.
When I saw you, I immediately understood that you were duplicating yourself.
In any case, let's come up with a keyword.
What I want most is my personal fork.
Do you want a personal fork?
Yes, I already have my own spoon.
It's good to talk.
Let's start.
Okay.
5 hours ago, I will not remember that you called me by name.
You can hold it like this.
Yes, keep it straight.
Beautiful ribbon.
Right?
Do you want to try it on?
I still have one.
Cosplay, huh?
Are you interested?
Not at all.
I can't put on something like this in front of others.
I see.
5 hours ago, Mayuri has not left yet.
As it is now, they will finish at the same time.
Done!
Ta-da!
Victory!
We had a race.
We lost.
But we also finished.
Now everything is ready.
We will not conduct an experiment.
Not too unexpected.
What are you talking about?
You are all tired.
Let's talk later.
Today we finished.
I'll take a plate.
One plate.
What are you doing here?
I was going to eat when I received your message.
Didn't you think you would often dine here?
Not often at all.
Mayuri told me about this place.
What did you want to talk about?
You told us to get out of here.
Then you suddenly sent me a message.
Do you see?
I came from the future in 5 hours.
What?
You're talking nonsense that I've ever heard.
Hey!
You said something else!
You told me to believe!
What are you talking about?
I'm sure I'll believe you.
I wouldn't say something so illogical.
But you said!
I'll build this car myself.
Everything will work out.
You looked very stupid.
Are you an idiot?
Yes, I believe.
How can I prove it?
Most of all in the world you want my own fork.
Well?
Did I really tell you that?
Me in 5 hours?
You said you had a personal spoon.
What would you be me in the future?
Now you believe me, right?
So...
As I thought, the car is working.
Great!
Here's your plate.
I see.
It looks like things are getting worse.
Yeah.
To get Mayuri to run away, you tried to stop Maek.
You call them traitors?
You tried to stop her and her group?
Yes.
But I couldn't prevent Mayuri's death.
I see.
In this case, there must be some reason.
It will lead to death.
Usually, death leads to some phenomenon.
For example, an accident or illness.
We can't determine the exact cause.
Most often the cause is the carrier.
But the real cause is probably different.
Proof that without carriers, Mayuri still dies.
The cause of death.
So what's the cause?
I don't know.
It's possible that the cause of Mayuri's death...
...is her own life.
You mean her term is over?
It's a fatalism.
Of course.
So I reject this hypothesis.
The cause must be what leads to these series of incidents.
It will.
Maybe if it doesn't end, Mayuri...
Wait!
It's too dangerous to make such conclusions.
But Kurisu is right.
You...
Do you know something?
You are more or less right.
To fix all this, it is not enough not to complete the machine in time.
To save the world.
You need to get into the beta direction of reality.
You must overcome the 1% barrier of divergence.
Divergence indicator determines the location of the line of reality.
And this can help us...
...to measure the divergence.
Gas discharge indicator.
No matter who made it, it has a good taste.
But of course, you made it.
Me?
You can save memories.
Traveling along the lines of reality.
In the future, you will make this meter...
...to indicate the difference between this reality and the previous one in digital form.
0337187.
This is the indicator of this line of reality.
The line of reality is similar to the weaving of this rope.
From afar, they look like one line.
But in fact, it consists of threads that are thinner.
These threads are the lines of reality.
They never intersect.
But they all lead to the same place.
In other words, they all lead to the death of Mayuri.
But if you change the reality too much...
...by going from our alpha direction to the beta...
...by overcoming the 1% barrier of divergence...
...everything will end differently.
You get on this.
Wait, I can't get on it.
Okay.
Just wait here.
Who is she?
Definitely a professional.
Or something like that.
Let's go.
Hurry up.
Alpha and beta directions of reality are very different.
In other words, the future is a different world line.
But it's okay, it's possible to move between them.
If you change the past...
...using time duplication or DMAIL, then nothing will come out.
But once important events occur in the world for several years...
...and the choice of splitting the lines of reality into many new ones.
The last ones were, for example, in 1991 during the war in the bay.
In 2000 there was the problem of the millennium.
And in 2010 the invention of the time machine.
This is...
When splitting occurs...
...there is an opportunity to travel between the directions of reality.
How to do this?
How? Wait.
First...
Tell us who you are.
This is...
The time machine.
I'm from 2036.
Suzuka.
