Can you understand him?
You thought he was confused by this surprise?
I have an emergency.
The office is still in the laboratory,
as the agent said.
What?
Is this also the order of Wratstein?
Wratstein?
The idea of the Alkarine,
in fact, does not mean anything.
She did not doubt.
She blinded the Kolesi with foreign words.
Understand!
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm used to living in America.
Nice to meet you.
I'm Kurisu Makise.
You can't even shake hands?

It's written on your forehead that you want to kill me.
It's written on your forehead that you want to kill me.
You decided to show me your kung fu.
Where are you going?
Actually, I came here to find out
if you really said that I was killed.
Or did you justify your help?
But this thing will be more interesting.

Paranoia of parallel processes
Paranoia of parallel processes
The spiked line is intact.
It doesn't look like a trick.
She can put a bomb in.
Don't look down on her.
She won't put anything in.
Do you have tweezers? No.
Okay.
Go inside.
Tasty.
You're a zombie.
If you want to eat, then tell me.
I'll give you a banana.
Who needs a banana?
Who needs a banana?
You came from nowhere and you took my paw.
Makise?
Yes?
Can you tell me who needs a banana?
Can you tell me who needs a banana?
Once again.
If you can, with a sad voice.
Sad?
What's going on?
Did you imagine something?
Admit it.
You're our genius.
Tell us what the genius girls dream about.
Tell us.
I see.
You're both worried.
It's not a compliment.
Here's who's worried.
You're a worried genius.
Who's worried?
Okay.
Honestly, you've done enough
But I'm not.
Tell us more.
The banana was in this microwave.
It has something to do with the microwave.
It's a secret.
Fantastic trick.
Microwave phone.
Our secret weapon.
Makise, could you explain
how this shit works?
It's all right.
We'll figure it out ourselves.
We'll figure it out ourselves.
But this is
This is our...
Listen here.
Are you Christina?
No, I didn't say that.
I'll tell you the secret of the microwave phone.
But only under two conditions.
First, you have to become an employee
of the lab of the laboratory.
Do you want me to join you?
But I'm returning to America in August.
And second...
And second...
Forget that I worked for you.
Doctor!
Oh, Akarin, you're small.
Very small.
I adore you for that.
Shut up.
But the conditions are not bad.
Not bad for you.
Oh, my God.
My brain is already boiling for you.
So what, Christina?
Are you going to call me Tina?
Then you'll be a zombie.
Say my name normally.
What?
You're a genius.
You're a genius.
Shut up, you're a genius.
Okay.
Great. I agree.
No more geniuses.
And I won't call you that.
Great.
From now on, you're an employee of the lab 004.
Christina!
Tina is not there.
Do you think this is a phone?
And here I am.
Let's not rush with conclusions.
What do you think it is?
At least not that juicy Jaguar.
He didn't teleport those bananas.
One, two, three, four...
We have a guest.
Hi.
I'm Kurisu Makise.
Sorry for not warning you.
Looks like I'm in your team now.
In our team?
Yes.
We have a girl in our team.
Is that so rare?
Yes, yes, yes.
You're the only one, not counting me.
I see.
I'm glad to meet you.
Yes, I'm glad too.
What? What happened?
We didn't hear from her.
Why didn't you tell me earlier?
Tell me.
Well,
something like lightning
flew out of the microwave.
Yesterday
you saw the satellite
and jumped out.
And then I connected
her phone.
So when I wrote to you
your mobile phone
was connected to the microwave
and you wrote to me
about Makise's murder?
It was a week ago.
No, I wrote it yesterday.
Where is it?
It's gone.
When it happened, what did you do with the stove?
I did regular tests.
I checked the reverse rotation.
Let's try to repeat the experience.
Mayuri,
bring your hot number here.
Okay.
Do you want to try?
I want to see
what will happen to it
when we rotate the stand in the opposite direction.
Daru!
Assistant,
send a message to my phone.
How long have I been your assistant?
And I don't know your number.
What a useless assistant.
Daru, give me your phone.
What should I write in the headline?
Let's think about it.
Kristina is worried.
Let's write,
Karina is worried.
What?
Well done, Hashida.
I'm sending it.
Let's wait until the message is delivered.
The food is ready.
Stop!
Wait!
What?
Are you okay?
Yes.
Turn on the fire extinguisher.
What happened?
Maybe the electromagnetic waves
are not stupid.
Electromagnetic waves
would never cut the table so quickly.
They burned!
And I just bought it.
What should we do
if the fire extinguisher
notices us?
Well,
July 27,
July 24,
11.30.
It was a week ago.
Did you figure it out?
Yes, I figured it out.
I've seen the answers
to all the questions.
Really?
The torn banana
broke again.
The message from the past.
It can't be.
You don't want to say it, do you?
The microwave phone is
the time machine.
The time machine.
13 messages.
Lightning.
Oh, right.
I forgot about the lightning-powered
set-up.
So much?
Are you sleeping now?
How long are you going to sleep?

I understand, but I haven't caught the essence of the message yet.
The evil is in my heart.
That's all.
Okarin, are you kidding me?
I have to find out what evil they are thinking and find out about the Time Machine.
Let's turn the microwave into a real Time Machine, or it will be dusting in our storeroom.
Now it depends on you.
I don't care about the consequences.
I don't care about the consequences.
You have 800 yen.
Okarin!
Are you sulking again?
Yeah, it's boring in the store.
There's nothing to do.
You'd better go to the store.
By the way, what are you doing on the second floor?
What are you doing on the second floor?
There are fantastic devices in this laboratory of yours.
How did you know the name?
The laboratory of fantastic devices.
Well, since you've discovered so much, we're fighting against an organization that doesn't rule the world.
And now we're breaking into the server.
Oh, so you're asking about the Time Machine?
How did you guess?
I'm sorry, I overheard your conversation.
Well, I was bored, so I...
The spies are after us.
I just heard it.
But don't worry.
My mouth is still on the lock.
Again?
What?
Did someone die?
Someone died?
I'm kidding.
Joke, joke.
Someone is chasing an IBM computer.
IBM?
You know about it?
Well, yes.
Did you also listen to it?
No, I read it on the Internet.
I saw it online.
Did you hear about the guy who considers himself a time traveler?
John Titor, I think.
Titor?
He was sitting on the edge.
IBM 500 was created before the appearance of BASIC.
So with his help, you can decipher your own IBM language.
Really?
Yeah.
And John Titor appeared in 2000.
In 2000.
You have primitive ideas about the nature of time.
Time is not just a movement from the past to the future.
Let's say I go back to the past and kill a person.
This change is called the divergence point.
And the world line flows into the world without a person A.
Accordingly, the memories of people change.
In other words, the memories of the line in which A existed will disappear.
And in their place will come memories in which A did not exist.
I'm interested in how the researchers from CERN turned into world dictators.
I've been asking this question for a long time.
Don't believe the words of CERN.
They have already created small black holes.
Imagine the revival of communism and the return of the life of the 18th century.
In 2036, the majority of scientists and technology will be in the hands of CERN.
And you need IBM 500 to see the future.
Exactly.
With the help of IBM 500, I will destroy their plans.
John Titor appeared in 2000.
I was saying the same thing.
I appeared 10 years ago.
I appeared 10 years ago?
I already said that, unfortunately, I was not in 2000.
But it is quite possible that you met in a parallel world line.
Interesting.
I would like to talk to you again.
Here are my coordinates.
Contact me and I will answer.
Almost done.
If I get the SQL table, the password will be spit out.
Good morning.
Mayuri?
Why are you so early?
We haven't slept for two nights in a row.
I brought you a snack.
Here you are.
Wow, a stew.
Great.
You can bring some more later.
I don't have enough money to feed you.
I still have to buy a Krainet sausage.
Are you looking for an oppo again?
So please help yourself.
There is also chicken for Daru.
This is not suitable.
He doesn't even listen.
I told him to rest.
Magma flows in the veins of a cool hutsker.
Don't call me a hutsker.
But stealing other people's secrets is bad.
We have to reveal the conspiracy of the Sern.
Anyway, I think Kurisu left because she got angry at you.
That has nothing to do with it.
She just left.
I wonder if she will come back.
Oh, what?
Oh, what?
I'll give you a tangerine and you'll give me meat.
It's better to share the eggs.
No, I'm almost like meat.
I love them.
I'll give you fish.
Well, I guess I love fish more than eggs.
We'll decide that.
Where is the meat?
I've already eaten.
When did you have time?
I was hungry.
I got it!
I got it, I got it, I got it!
Kurisu, open the door for me.
I got it!
Here's the login.
The task is completed.
Congratulations.
Kurisu didn't understand what to do.
But they broke in.
But without one, the access will be incomplete.
Oh, what a shame.
Zhenya, you're so old-fashioned.
Did you find anything?
There's a text here.
In English.
Where are my words?
Why is it in Moroccan?
They write, hello, Paul.
Don't use that expression.
Right?
The text is working well.
Capricious as a cat,
but surprisingly stable
What does it mean?
I don't know.
And about the time machine,
is there anything?
The phrase time machine
doesn't come up anywhere.
But the Z program
has been mentioned more than a hundred times in the last month.
Let's see.
Z program,
experiment protocol number 137.
I've already figured out the mini black hole.
I won't delete the report.
I won't delete the report.
Mini black hole.
Yeah.
And the whole world was told that the experiments failed.
Is there anything else?
The results of the experiment?
The man is dead.
Unluckily selected.
The man is dead.
The man is dead.
Someone
is dead.
Someone is dead.
Someone is dead.
Someone is dead.
