Now I will explain your task. Final mission. Scalp operation.
Change the result without changing the established past.
The past in which Makise Kurisu lies in a puddle of blood.
And Akabe Rintaro finds her.
Change the past without changing this event.
Dad, give me a screwdriver.
Why, dad?
Come on, hurry up.
It seems to me that it will only work once.
We only have enough fuel to drive back and forth.
So you won't be able to return to the future.
Actually, I wasn't going to go there.
Change the world line here. Change the future.
And I won't have to go back.
But...
If I fail, I'll stay here.
I'm going to live here.
I'll regret it forever.
Don't be stupid.
Uncle.
I'm not your uncle.
I'm a mad scientist.
And the one who destroys the world's control structure is a failure.
It is not considered.
Understood.
I rely on you.
So, let's start the search for the operation skills.
The time has come!
To be continued...
To be continued...
To be continued...
I'm in the lab.
Hurry up!
We can't leave the time machine unattended for a long time.
A fireball?
What are you going to do with it?
Thick red liquid. That's what I need.
Oh, so that's what's in there.
I see.
Are you going to replace this blood with Curisumakis?
Exactly.
On July 28, if I see Christina lying unconscious in a puddle of blood,
the past will not change.
That's why the Scalp operation is included.
I guess it makes sense.
However, isn't it too simple?
The future Ocarina said as if some terribly cunning option would work there.
I didn't think about it at all.
Oh, thank you.
It's always more dramatic if the plan is simple.
Idiot.
I see him through. I read all his thoughts.
I don't know if I should be impressed or not.
Our madman has gone crazy.
Listen, Ocarina...
Did Curisumakis happen to sit here?
Together with you, Mayuri.
She was very nervous and talked to Daru.
Mayusha didn't understand anything, but they had a lot of fun.
Ocarina and Curis were constantly arguing, but in fact they were very friendly.
Mayusha, what are you talking about?
Curisumakis is a genius scientist.
She would never have come to such a laboratory.
Strange, isn't it?
Maybe it's a dream?
Maybe she has the same reading as Steiner?
No, she doesn't.
However, somewhere in her subconscious, she remembers.
What happened in those worlds?
Everyone remembers. In your hearts.
Curis did everything she could to save Mayuri.
Mayuri, no.
We are all here now thanks to Curis.
Eh?
Listen, Ocarina...
Do you love Curis?
Kristina is my assistant.
My good friend.
And very dear to me.
Is that so?
And she loves me too.
I have no doubt.
Ocarina found a real girlfriend?
Then you have to save her.
No matter what.
You have to save her.
Yes.
Yes.
Look at me, be sure to bring her back.
Take Curis with you.
It will be done.
Amane...
If you are really my daughter...
Who is my wife?
I won't tell you that.
Again, huh?
Go!
We arrived at the same time as last time.
The rest is up to you.
I understand.
Leave the promise to the light dream, where I will tell you.
Leave it to me.
Change the result without changing the established past.
For that to work.
This is where you have to start.
I don't know all the consequences.
But if I take away the Iron Ufo from here...
It will make it impossible for metal seekers to react to this folder.
I think so.
There are not so many of them left in this series.
And Mayusha doesn't have coins for 100 yen.
Don't be a spoiled girl, Mayuri.
Even if we have known each other since childhood, I will not lend you money.
I will show you how cruel life is.
It's an Upo!
Is it rare?
The most ordinary, but still very cute.
There is. Next.
Oh, I'm sorry!
Kurisu!
Eh?
How do you know my name?
Have we met somewhere?
Kurisu!
Do you hear me?
What is it?
Answer me!
Kurya!
Kurya!
Kurya!
Kurya!
Hmm?
I will save you.
The press conference of Professor Nakanobachi begins in the conference hall on the eighth floor.
Wait!
Wait!
Kurya!
Kurya!
I never thought I would have to pretend to be myself.
Mayuri dropped the Upo.
Did Kurisu find it?
Mayuri.
However, the Upo is now not iron.
It means that the folder will not be noticed and it will burn during the fire on the plane.
It remains only to deal with Nakanobachi and guess the moment to knock Kurisu out.
The liquid has dried up!
That's right!
He was lying there for too long.
Hermeticity has been violated and the liquid has dried up.
What do you want?
Dad, I wanted you to look.
Think!
There must be something.
Something!
Nakanobachi's case will probably not be so complicated.
What is it?
Nakanobachi's case will probably not be so complicated.
Nakanobachi's case will probably not be so complicated.
It's not difficult.
But where to get the blood?
If there is something similar.
Shut up!
How dare you call it theft!
I found it!
Stop it!
Who are you?
I am the thirst for chaos!
I am the one who destroys the world-managing structures!
And I will destroy your ambitions!
Do you know my name?
I am...
Himer...
Kyoro!
Do you understand what you're talking about?
You're that kid!
I see.
So that's how it is.
You agreed to cancel my press conference.
You agreed to cancel my press conference.
Exactly!
Exactly!
Dad!
Run!
No!
What's next?
Why did you prepare this knife?
What are you afraid of?
Are you afraid?
Is my divine power really scaring you like that?
Don't get on my nerves!
What's wrong with you?
You're trembling with fear!
How long are you going to insult me and get on my nerves?
After all, you are a small, pathetic little man.
The one who is too greedy to please the talent of his daughter will not be able to kill me.
A small creature like you will never be able to kill me.
It's a secret!
What's going on?
I can't believe it!
I can't believe it!
He got what he deserved!
Calm down!
Almost there!
I can't believe it!
I can't believe it!
I can't believe it!
I can't believe it!
I can't believe it!
You scum!
I'll kill you!
I'll kill you!
I'll kill you!
Don't come near me!
Don't move!
Lie down! I'll call an ambulance!
Help!
Is this an ambulance?
Send someone immediately!
Me!
I told you!
I told you!
Who saved you?
I told you!
I told you!
I told you!
I told you!
I told you!
I told you!
I told you!
I told you!
I told you!
I told you!
I told you!
I told you!
I told you!
I told you!
That's exactly what I saw.
That's exactly what I saw.
Kurisu.
Kurisu.
Uncle.
Goodbye.
Wait.
You can wait a minute.
We don't have time for that.
You're bleeding.
Please.
Hey, is anyone here?
Good luck.
You've come to the beginning of the longest and most important life.
You've come to the beginning of the longest and most important life.
The longest and most important three weeks in your life.
The longest and most important three weeks in your life.
The most important three weeks.
You shouldn't have pulled.
You shouldn't have pulled.
You're not normal.
Why not normal?
You did it.
All I can do is stop the bleeding.
Let's go to the hospital.
It's going to be hard. Try to hold on.
Let's go.
This is...
Yes.
No one knows what's going on in Brad Steiner's line.
No one knows what's going on in Brad Steiner's line.
Suzuka.
But, if your theory is correct,
the document burned out and the race weapon is gone.
The document burned out and the race weapon is gone.
The third world war is just the same.
The third world war is just the same.
I can't stay with you.
I can't stay with you.
So I want to thank you now.
Thank you.
See you in seven years.
See you in seven years.
Episode 4
Akarin for Akabe Rintaro.
Akabe Rintaro-sama.
Akarin!
Huh?
This document could change the future!
It was a description of the Time Machine!
And it burned!
His words were not understood, and the Russian government decided to refuse.
Ryukakun, did Akarin come to me?
I can't find him.
When did he come?
This is the sign of the Labyrinth number 008.
When did I get up?
These memories are stored in your and another life in a parallel world.
What kind of letters are these?
Today?
You just left, didn't you?
I knew it!
Ferris, didn't he give you anything?
Let me remember.
This is the sign of the Labyrinth number 007.
When you need my help, press it and tell me.
I'm here like here.
Huh?
Akabe, what are you doing here?
My name is Mayuri!
Parampampam, Nae-chan!
Yeah, she works here from today.
I'm Kiryu Mayuko.
She helped me when you fell.
She says she's unemployed, so now she'll work for me.
I'm Mayuri's son.
Mayuri!
She's popular.
Akabe, when you see her, you'll fall right away.
Come to the lab whenever you want.
Wait.
Thank you.
Parampampam!
Welcome, Karin!
Welcome, Akarin!
Akase?
Where is he?
He said he was shopping.
I see.
And this?
He said these are the signs of the Labyrinth number 002 and 003.
And when he got so many Labyrinths, he said the last number 008.
Oh, this is Akarin.
Shina, Hashida, Urushibara, Ferris...
Who are M, K and A?
I don't know.
By the way, he took another one out of the box.
Labyrinth number 008 will join us in seven years.
Are you thinking again?
This is an inevitable future.
Your future.
Mine?
Seven years.
It will be fun.
Who do you think it will be?
In seven years?
I can't even imagine.
But I don't think the lab will change.
And it doesn't matter how many years it will take.
Where are you now?
Are you writing an article for an American laboratory?
Or are you working all night on some kind of experiment?
Maybe you're still thinking about your father.
You don't remember the three weeks we spent together.
But that's okay.
You're breathing right now, talking.
Maybe you're thinking about something.
That's enough.
You see the same world.
The same future as me.
This world and its uncertain future.
Finally!
Found you!
I've been looking for you all this time.
I wanted to thank you for saving me.
It's me.
Why is she here?
What?
Because I protected her?
Okay, okay, you're kidding me.
Well, that's their choice.
If that's their choice...
El Psy Kongro.
El Psy?
We met again, Christina.
I told you, I'm not Christina and I'm not your assistant.
What?
Welcome back, my assistant.
Max Chris.
No, Christina.
No one knows what the future holds.
That's why...
His potential is endless.
As this meeting shows.
This is...
Schneider's choice.
The End
