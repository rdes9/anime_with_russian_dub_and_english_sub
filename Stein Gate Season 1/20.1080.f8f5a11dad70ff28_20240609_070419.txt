You will die, abandoned, in anticipation, in 4 days, on August 15, the very reality has decided that you will die, it is inevitable. However, I will not let this happen. I am against reality, and I will save Yuri.

It seems that it is impossible until you return to the original world line. And in order for this to happen, you have to do everything in order.
He's so close. But now we have a lead.
Kiryu Moiko will do everything she is told by FB, right?
FB is her commander, isn't it? Then?
If I follow IBN-5100, then maybe I'll be able to contact him.
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
Bread.
I also want to see FB.
Didn't you avoid meeting him?
Because they hate you or something?
I want to know the truth.
What will it give you?
I don't know.
Do you think I'll work with you?
Well, I guess I can talk to you.
What?
What happened?
Nothing.
Kiryu Moiko is there with you?
Why?
She just came out like that.
If anything happens, I'll tell you.
Hey, wait!
Damn it.
Was that Akarin?
Yes.
Something wrong?
It seems that lately we don't talk to him at all.
Mayuri's sister!
Nae!
Hello, sister-assistant.
Kurisu's sister.
Hello.
I'm sorry for yesterday.
Tell her that the rent has increased by 5,000 yen.
Okay.
By the way, I didn't see him today.
Did he get sick or what?
They say that idiots don't get sick.
I think he's looking for something for his experiments.
Experiments?
What a happy guy.
A student in his room with friends like you who do everything he says.
He's really happy.
However...
Dad, if we don't hurry up, we'll be late for the sale.
Are you sure?
Let's go, Nae!
Bye, sisters!
Bye!
What do you want for dinner?
I don't know.
I don't know.
An FB message?
Can I take a look?
It seems that M4 was right.
To be honest, no one works as hard as M4.
M4?
That's where the name FB came from.
I don't know his name.
I don't know his name.
I don't know his name.
I don't know his name.
I don't know his name.
I don't know his name.
Nae, FB and I are the only ones who know him.
It's a secret.
It's true that you can be bad at communicating with other M4s.
But that's what makes you who you are.
Motherfucker, right?
.
That's IBM 500.
Then, it can be an FB.
FB is a woman.
I know him.
What's going on?
Damn it!
What happened?
I'll explain later.
Mr. Brown?
Have you ever driven a car?
No?
Please be careful.
Have you seen him before?
Never.
What does it mean?
I don't know.
4 days later.
15th of August.
The reality is that you're going to die.
It's inevitable.
5 days later.
A plane to France.
Right where CERN is.
Have you seen any woman who could be FB?
Can't you make one damn call?
I was busy.
Okay, you forgot about me.
But...
What about Mayuri?
If you think about it, it seems we haven't talked for a long time.
She said the same thing.
I'm sorry.
Let's go.
We have to ask him directly.
Ask him?
Someone we've known for a long time?
5 days later.
What brought you here so early?
Okay, come in.
What's the matter?
You came to pay another 6,000 yen that I added to the calendar?
Hey, hey!
You were supposed to say that it's over a thousand!
I want to ask you something.
What's so official?
You know who FB is, don't you?
You know, don't you?
We've seen everything.
And the IBM 5100 was taken away from here.
We have nothing to do with you.
We want to see FB.
Please tell me where he is.
You gave us all M4.
The code name that FB gave me.
Only I and FB know him.
It can't be.
Have you heard about Ferdinand Brown?
The Nobel laureate who invented Brown's body?
Exactly about him.
And what are his initials?
FB.
So you're...
It can't be.
And you were supposed to hide behind us from reality?
Let's continue elsewhere.
This city keeps changing.
Is it true that you're FB?
Yes.
But the messages...
The mails...
They're all written by me.
Why did I write them as a woman?
To trick you.
But you're not the only one.
I wrote to many others,
assuming that they needed the most.
People like you are the easiest to catch.
Why did you interrupt the contact?
Since she found the IBM 5100,
I didn't need her anymore.
That's why I stopped replying to her.
I looked for employees through SMS.
It's easy to get rid of them when the job is done.
Nobody will stop them.
I can't believe you're FB.
FB?
Suzuha...
It seems that Suzu took care of you.
I didn't take care of you!
How did you find out about Suzu?
Suzu didn't do anything for me.
Nothing.
What are you talking about?
Did anyone sleep in the sewers in the middle of winter?
I was a child.
The concrete was so cold that it was cold to the bones.
I didn't eat for three or four days.
And when I was lying down,
they came.
The rats thought I was dead.
They came to eat me.
And then they stretched a thread on top of me.
I eat like a web.
I had no choice but to grab the snake.
Even if I had to get my hands dirty up here.
I can't get rid of this thread.
I perfectly understand that I'm like a dog on a leash.
I can't run away.
Dogs that run away from their owners.
Betrayers always die.
And when you complete your mission, you will die too.
You called me a bitch, didn't you?
But I'm even worse.
I'm just a bum.
Sometimes I think about running away.
But while I have something important to take care of,
I don't want to drag them into it.
But failures do not forgive.
And if you run away, they will come for your family.
I failed too.
But Naya will not know anything.
If I die.
Stop!
Stop!

His phone!
D-Mail!

Kamu, M4, stop searching IBN-5100,
keep quiet and wait for further instructions, do not stick out!
Moeka
I no longer need IBN-5100, Moeka.
Moeka, you don't need him.
Boss said to stop searching.
Yes, it's Urushibara.
And Kyoma?
What? IBM 5100?
Yes!
It's him!
Daru!
Hashida is not here.
He said he was going to Komima.
Please, listen to my request.
I see.
To save Mayuri, we have to get rid of this Alpha Line of the world.
And return to the world line before sending your first D-Mail.
To the Beta Line.
No.
To achieve this, we need to get rid of information from the database of Xerna.
Mayusha is dying, and my daughter Amano is from the future.
If we think about it, then I think Akarin could become famous.
I would like it to be so.
Do you believe in this, Max?
As a hypothesis.
If possible, I prefer to rely on reliable, objective data.
But now there is no such possibility.
The time jump machine that you made works great.
Did you?
Yes.
Of course I did.
What else?
What?
No, nothing.
What?
I said nothing.
You need to know the parameters, but I think I can start in 10 minutes.
I count on you, Super Hutsker.
Super Hutsker!
The first D-Mail, right?
That's when I was cut or something like that, right?
What?
Did you say that to me?
The exchange of all D-Mails will return to the world line from the beginning.
The world line in which Xerna will not establish his order.
The line in which Mayuri will not die.
And on this line, Kurisu Makise will not die.
