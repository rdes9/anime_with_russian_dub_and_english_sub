This is the result of the experiment. A man died. Unluckily selected.
A man died?
Who?
Yeah.
Someone.
Died?
Well, yes. It turns out that so.
And then what?
More details in the Geleman report number 143.
Geleman report?
What kind of report? How should I know?
They have a damn lot of data in the database.
What is it?
Some kind of code?
Programming languages for teapots.
Daru?
I do not understand!
What nonsense is this?
Die! What's wrong with you?
Round up, guys!
I felt for the first time!
What does it mean to fail in the steps of victory?
Well, it turned out.
Take a break.
And without you I would have thought.
That's it.
Hold this shuankudaru.
Thank you.
Program code.
IBM 5100 was created before the appearance of BASIC.
It means that with its help you can decipher your own IBM language.
I need IBM 500 to destroy their plans.
Let's discuss this matter.
Here is my address.
If you contact me, I will answer.
John Titor, there is a question for you.
Brother Steiner!
What is it?

I want to protect your smile
And again, into the loop of time
The lonely observer is swallowed up
Into the loop of time
Introduction to wandering abstractions
How many clothes are there?
We worked with Daru all night
And we were not at home
And all the things from the T-shirt and duffel are huge
Baby Feiris!
Rintaro Kabe!
Shalom!
I warned you
First of all, my name is Chimera Rockavoy
Secondly, such a greeting is dangerous
Shalom, Suzu!
And you there!
When did you get to know each other?
We live in the same house, after all
At least we know each other in the face
Suzu gave me a card from Raineta
Gold!
And where are you going?
To the laundry room
And Karin and Daru made a lot of money
Assistant!
Go to work until I fire you
Well!
And you, Akabe, don't mess with my assistant
Did you think you were the only one who fell in love with her, Mr. Brown?
Will you say that to Nae?
I promise
I'll beat you up
Nae?
Oh, with that squirrel?
My daughter is not a squirrel
And yet, how did you manage to crash into a child?
I'm not a child!
I'm an adult, I'm a fighter!
That's better
A fighter at half a bet
Keep the mark and move on
Then one day you will be able to turn into a real fighter
Shut up already
It's worth opening your mouth, but I'm already a fighter
Why do I always get all sorts of mistakes?
Bye
It's time for us too
Oh, this is Mayuri's habit
I call her to shake hands with the star dust
I wish I could reach the stars
But they are not even visible
So what?
Even in the daytime, the stars remain in the sky
Mayuri's habit
There were powerful electromagnetic waves
No exception is the breakage of the probe
However, how to explain that banana?
Microwave phone is a time machine
Damn it, it's a time machine
Baby Fairies, why is he so with you?
I'm closing the lid
Daru is like the universe, it is constantly expanding
A silent setter?
What did the Titor think?
He asked to write to him
Tell me how to contact the Titor
Tell me how to contact the Titor
Tell me how to contact cool Hatzker
Oh, enough
New message
John Titor, are you serious?
Thank you for the message
Thanks for the message
If you believe the photo that you sent, it is in fact, our native language of programing, the IBM
To decipher it, you need the IBM 500
The Raptor Laboratory
It leads to the action of a secret, extraordinary plan!
Okarin, what's going on?
Wake up, Daru!
We're going to fight a huge organization that will secretly rule the world!
I'm angry!
They operate all over the world!
We're possessed by crazy ideas and they're preparing a terrible conspiracy!
The world needs a gloomy genius as ever!
We need to fulfill our mission and outrun them!
What are you talking about?
First, we need the IBM 5100.
Then we'll decode the mysterious program of CERN.
Get ready to perform!
But I'm working today...
Looks like I'll have to do it alone.
Maybe I should exchange information.
Assistant?
Wait!
What?
Come with me!
Hey!
Damn, my shoulder is cramping.
I don't know anything about this.
Nothing at all.
What are you staring at?
Nothing. It's none of your business.
Well, don't get mad at me.
Are you offended?
Mayuri was wondering why you could run away.
You're so mature, and you're behaving like a child.
Who would say that? But not you.
So, what do you want to talk about?
It's simple.
Enough, Dutsa. Come back to the lab, Kristina.
At least call me normally.
Learn to listen to other zombies.
And who needs to learn to listen?
Why did you just fall on my head?
I would knock on your head for your curiosity.
Again?
What? Are you tired of the message?
Yes, whether you believe it or not.
Maybe she's also from the office?
What kind of office is this?
The office is the office.
It's a secret society, and the truth is the destiny of the world.
Another conspiracy theory.
I might as well not try.
What happened?
Nothing.
It's true, nothing.
But if you ask, you'll get a bonus.
Now it's my fault.
Let's go.
We'll deal with Pratchichna and I'll give you a task.
And you think I'll go with you?
What? Pratchichna?
Where is she?
You don't have her in the hotel, do you?
The hotel is not bad, but Pratchichna is not.
However, I usually don't wear all my clothes in the washing machine.
Well, now you will know where she is.
Say thank you.
No changes?
Of course not.
And you thought something would happen when the drum would spin?
The answers are hidden in the most common things.
Who would have thought that a time machine would be obtained from a solar microwave?
This is not a time machine.
This cannot be.
Time machines are only in scientific fiction.
So this is without me.
But why do you deny what you saw?
I'm not...
It's not a child's trauma.
Yes, it all happened when she was five.
When Christina was walking along the green meadow of Arkansas, she was struck by lightning.
There was no such thing.
Then what's the matter?
I told you, this contradicts the theory.
All theories are just words.
Accept what you saw.
No.
Why are you so stubborn?
I said no.
I don't want to repeat the mistakes of my father.
Sorry.
I broke down.
Don't worry.
I made you angry on purpose to see your reaction.
Whatever it is, microwaves and phones are not a time machine.
I understand.
Sorry for making you go into the lab.
You can no longer come.
Well, here's what I'll tell you.
We will not have other employees 004.
This number is yours forever.
And what do you want to achieve?
What is it?
I made such a simple speech.
That's the point.
Stay here, you have a washing machine.
And I'll go.
See you.
What?
I didn't let you go.
Think about your rude behavior.
Yes, bye.
Wait.
Don't touch me.
Do you know anything about IBM 500?
Do you know something?
IBM?
An old computer.
And why do you need it?
Are you interested?
I see that you are interested.
Damn it.
Just a little bit.
IBM 500 is connected to the secrets of CERN.
CERN is engaged in time travel.
And in order to figure out their secrets,
we need special functions of IBM 500.
Well, are you surprised?
What a nonsense.
I wasted my time for nothing.
Hey, you, primitive.
Wow.
I'll prove it to you.
Just give me some time.
Just give me some time, Christina.
No, in my name, Tina.
CERN is engaged in time travel
with special functions of IBM 500.
Well, I thought she would be interested.
A computer?
Yes, an old model.
Is it worth 500 yen?
500 yen?
Maybe so.
Pampararam, Akarin.
Just listen.
I found something interesting.
No cell phones.
Fairies said she saw the computer you're looking for.
Stop talking.
Wait.
That's it.
That's not enough.
What the hell?
Hello, everyone.
And here I am.
Meowca Fairies.
The day-to-day stage of Fairies Cup begins.
Come on, try to beat me
and get a special cat omelet with rice.
What the hell?
Oh, Akarin.
Mayuri.
What's going on here?
Is it a space-time anomaly?
No, it's just Fairies Cup.
Fairies will play the Reinet Battle with anyone they want.
Oh, Himir.
And you decided to participate, meow?
I can play with 10 people at the same time, meow.
So...
No.
I want to know where IBM 500 is.
Where is it?
Well...
Will you play? I'll tell you, meow.
But...
Don't fool around.
It's about the future of the world order.
And you're playing stupid games.
Those who don't want to play can't be here, meow.
The maid is escorting her clients?
IBM 500.
I don't listen to you, meow.
Time is short.
It doesn't matter.
But I'll play with all my strength.
You're so confident, meow.
Akarin, you'll win.
Our Fairies is one of the best players in the country.
I'll win, Yuli.
You're worried about the Fairies.
I have a clever plan.
Plan?
Let's code it.
K.
M.
K.
Z.
Plan?
K. M. K. Z.
Sounds cool.
Let's have some fun, meow.
You can be happy as long as you can.
When I put my plan into action, you won't be saved.
That's why.
Are you serious, meow-himer?
Let me explain.
I'll play with you.
After that, you'll tell me everything.
By hand?
I swear by my ears, meow.
Hold on.
And all your rivals will bite your teeth.
I give up.
That's what I hoped for.
But where's your plan?
I don't know.
It feels like he did it on purpose, like Kamikaze.
Kamikaze?
K. M. K. Z.
Kamikaze?
Couldn't you come up with a worse joke?
Get to the point.
Tell me everything you know, Fairies.
Don't you want a lot, meow?
I made a deal.
I'll play.
After that, you'll tell me everything.
And about my plan.
I didn't even think about it.
Really?
Well, I don't remember, meow.
Then remember.
Here's my clever plan.
You don't have to show off too much.
Shut up!
Where's the IBM 500?
Well...
You don't know?
Well, my dad had one when I was a kid.
But it broke down, meow.
Then why?
So it's a forbidden technique.
What did you know about this escape from the answer in the Guiyang Mountains?
How did you guess, meow?
Well done, chemist.
You got away with my trickery.
Is that true?
Yes, meow.
Actually, I saw it in the Akihabara shrine, meow.
In the shrine?
Chris, thank you for not forgetting us in Japan.
About your question.
In general, the professor says that the IBM 500 really
can work with special programming languages.
So he wasn't lying?
Computer?
I need to ask my dad.
The IBM 500?
If he doesn't understand, just tell him it's an old computer.
Okay, I'll ask him.
I'm counting on you.
Do you remember the password?
L.C. Congri.
Congro.
I'm listening.
It's Makise.
Makise?
I'm sorry, I don't know them.
I'm sorry, I don't know them.
We met somewhere.
In Paris, London.
In Akihabara.
We just met.
What?
Ah, my assistant.
You could say I'm Christina.
I'm not Tina.
Powerful and loud, as always.
And who's to blame for that?
Who?
What do you want?
Where are you now?
Why are you asking?
Just like that.
I'm going to the Yamabayashi temple.
What was that?
Are you trying to trick me?
Why did you call?
I just asked where you were.
And no one called you?
Yeah, no one called me.
It's me.
Did your father say something?
Yeah, he said the computer was here.
Really?
The computer?
Are you talking about the IBM 500?
Are you talking about the IBM 500?
Yes.
And who's that?
My assistant.
So, the IBM...
Wait!
Is that how people introduce themselves?
And I'm not your assistant.
And I'm not here to introduce you.
It's just a matter of five seconds.
And you're so annoying.
Kurisu Maitse, my assistant.
Yeah, yeah.
Okay, I'm your assistant.
And who are you?
Ryukuro Shibara.
Ryukuro Shibara.
And how old are you?
Seventeen.
You're a year younger than me.
Really?
You look so mature, Maitse.
You have such a beautiful face.
What are you talking about?
Okay, I'll go call my dad.
You know less, you sleep better.
What are you talking about?
I didn't think it would ever happen.
What do you mean?
Are you serious?
Well, the guy who gave us this computer said that one day a young man will appear who will need it.
He asked us to save him.
It was about ten years ago.
So, it's...
It's fate.
The will of the Steiner's brother.
Again for his own good.
A portable computer, IBM 500.
There it is.
Is everything okay?
Yeah.
Can I borrow it?
Of course.
Thank you very much.
Okay, take it.
Help me.
No.
You're my assistant, Christina.
I'm not your assistant, I'm not Tina.
I'll give you a cart.
You're so stupid.
I'm not your assistant, I'm not Tina.
You're so stupid.
You helped us so much.
Assistant, show some respect.
What? Respect?
Who would have said that?
I see you're getting along well.
And you don't offend Ryuk.
Yes, of course.
Wait a minute, I'll be right back.
You have a good father.
Really?
I won't repeat my father's mistakes.
I won't repeat my father's mistakes.
What?
Nothing.
I'm sorry, the cart broke.
Why am I helping you?
Don't be afraid, we're still far away.
Listen.
What?
Nothing.
I told you to say B.
Wait.
I have to go back.
Then go, assistant.
I can't.
I can't go like this.
You can, assistant.
Thank you for your support, but I won't go.
Let's go sideways.
Normally.
I'm going to fall now.
The continuation follows.
