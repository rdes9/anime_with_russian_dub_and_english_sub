Serna is taking the time machine. Serna? What are you talking about?
Kurisu Makise, Akabarin Taro, Kashido Itaro. You three will come with me.
Mayuri?
Mayuri's wife.
We don't need her.
No!
Don't do it!
For the sake of FB!
FB! FB!
Mayuri! Mayuri!
Mayuri!
What the hell?
What the hell?
Get away from her!
Akabe! Get away from her! She'll kill you too!
You'll pay for this! I'll make her pay for this!
The End
42nd.
Delic.
It's on.
The End
Hurry!
Akabe! I'm ready! But in case of failure!
Turn it on already!
Akabe!
I'm doubling!

Metaphysical necrosis
Manyuri was younger than the classmates
When her granny died
She went to the grave every day, even half a year later, she continued to come.
She always held her grandmother's watch in her hands and always looked up at the sky.
As if she was waiting for her grandmother to come and take her away.
One day, a ray of light fell on her.
What they call the enlightenment of Rembrandt or the ladder of the angel.
I felt that the light was going to take her away.
As if she were disappearing now.
Mayuri!
Okarin!
I won't let you take her away.
You are my hostage.
Now you are my hostage and I will use you in my experiments.
Those words were from the show that I watched as a child.
We watched it together with Mayuri.
Crazy scientist yelling like an idiot.
I see.
So Mayuri is your hostage, right?
Then I can't go away.
What happened?
Did you fall asleep?
What time is it now?
What?
It's about five o'clock.
You were going to the store, weren't you?
The store?
I'll order pizza.
Thank you.
Don't order the tropical one.
I can't stand it.
Good.
The time dubbing worked.
Akabe?
Mayuri, where is she?
What happened to you all of a sudden?
Mayuri said that she was going to invite you to a party.
Remember?
You went to the store?
The conference of the developers is canceled.
Why?
What happened?
Go home, both of you.
What's going on?
Just go home.
Go ahead.
What's wrong with him?
His phone rang, and then ...
Phone?
You called Mayu.
I can't answer you now.
If you want to leave a message ...
Nothing indicates that reality has changed.
That's what makes him different from D-Mail.
I came back at five in the evening.
Gatan, gatan.
It's a speed train.
No, it's a white speed train.
After that, Mayuri will return to Suzuki.
Maybe we should go to the police?
Maybe we should go to the police?
No, we have to believe that I am from the future.
Three hours left.
I have to come up with something.
Mayuri!
Mayuri!
That is, chemistry.
Where is Mayuri?
She has already left.
When?
About half an hour ago.
She said she was going back to the lab.
She didn't come back?
Excuse me.
It's great that you invited me to a party, but ...
I don't know what to do today.
Mayuri?
No.
If you see her, tell her to call me immediately.
Okay.
If reality has not changed,
then if I don't change anything,
everything will be the same.
Where is she?
Ferris can't answer you right now,
if you need anything.
Where are you, Mayuri?
Mayuri?
I didn't guess.
Assistant.
I said we were done for today.
Go home, admit it.
You duplicated yourself from the future, am I right?
How do you know?
After I called you on the phone, you changed.
Judging by your actions, I can assume that something happened.
Yes.
But now I don't have time to tell.
Just run.
Run? Where?
Anywhere.
The main thing is to get away from the lab.
Got it?
I promise you'll tell me later.
Okay, and warn Daru.
Agreed.
Akabe.
What?
Don't do anything stupid.
Okay.
Akabe Rin Daru.
You know, Ushanomi, you or Mayuri?
Shinu Mayuri?
She just invited me to a party.
Where is she?
She went there, I think.
Listen, where is Ushanomizu?
I promised to go shopping with her.
Ask the policeman.
And when you're done with her, don't come back.
What are you talking about?
I'll tell you later.
Mayuri.
Mayuri!
Akarin.
Look, the first star.
What?
Just come with me.
What about the party?
It's canceled.
I told Kurisu and Daru.
Why?
I'll explain later.
But I also invited Suzu.
Daru has already ordered pizza.
Just listen to me.
Akarin.
I'm sorry.
Mayushii doesn't understand.
You used to behave strangely.
But today I don't understand you at all.
Do you still want to experiment?
Mayuri.
It's not about that.
But now you can just listen to me.
We don't have time.
I'll explain everything later.
I promise.
Okay.
I'm sorry.
I was just very scared.
Don't apologize.
It's not your fault.
There are so many people here.
It's peak hour.
It's peak hour.
Huh?
But there's no one on the platform.
Let's repeat.
In connection with the threat of an explosion, the following lines were closed.
No one knows when the train will be released again.
What an idiot I am.
Not now.
Akarin.
Mayuri.
Run to the subway.
Akabe Rintaro, right?
What's going on?
You'll come with me.
What's going on?
Run!
Run!
Run!
Run as fast as you can!
Who are they?
Akarin!
Run faster!
Faster!
Run, Mayuri!
Only the train died, Mayuri.
Akabe?
No.
Akabe Rintaro is captured.
Mayuri!
Damn it!
I won't let you kill her!
Mayuri, I'll protect you!
I'll protect you!
Why didn't it cost me?
Why didn't it cost me?
It's cancelled?
Why?
Did something happen?
Yes.
Actually, I have information that Brown will return tonight.
Akarin, did you do something again?
Yes, something like that.
But what about Mayuri?
I'll talk to her.
It's too dangerous here.
It's too dangerous.
We're done for the day.
Was I too harsh?
No.
It doesn't matter that I behaved strangely.
Now I just need to take them away from the laboratory.
You called Mayuri.
I can't answer you now.
Why so long?
This will happen again.
I have to find Mayuri.
Ryukake.
Hello?
Ryukako, it's me, Akabe.
It's Okabe.
Okabe, excuse me.
Mayuri!
Mayuri, are you there?
Mayuri?
Yes.
She's leaving.
Stop her!
Tell her not to go anywhere until I come back.
But she...
Do as I say!
Okay.
Mayuri!
It's a speed train.
No, speed trains are white.
Mayuri!
Oh, Akarin!
Are you okay?
I was going to finish Fubuki's costume and then go to the laboratory.
Fubuki?
Cosplay friend?
Yes.
She said she had to finish something.
She just sent a message.
So here it is.
I'll go to the laboratory as soon as I'm done.
So I'll make it to the party.
Wait, the party...
The party is canceled.
That is, postponed.
Why?
We can't use the laboratory.
We can't do anything.
I see.
I want you to come with me for a while.
Right now.
And Fubuki?
Sorry, you'll come to her later.
It's very important.
Something happened?
Yes.
We'll leave for a while.
On a trip.
Together?
Well, that's...
Fubuki can wait until tomorrow.
But it's so sudden.
Where are we going?
I'll tell you later.
We don't have time to wait for the train.
But Mayu is not ready yet and...
Don't worry.
Come on, let's go.
Wait, Akarin!
Excuse me!
What?
Goodbye.
Bye-bye.
Akihabara
Aren't we going to the station, Akihabara?
We're going to the subway.
I see.
It's been a long time since you've held me like this.
It's been a long time.
Yeah.
Let's go back.
Great.
Let's go.
From the assistant.
Something happened.
Promise you'll tell me later.
To Kurisu.
Huh?
My clock has stopped.
Strange.
I started them recently.
There are so many people here.
The line is especially closed.
Is it closed?
Yes.
There's a threat of an explosion.
I see.
Listen, Akarin.
You know,
Mayushin has a lot of things to do,
but it doesn't matter now.
Instead,
when it's all over, promise you'll tell me everything.
Yeah.
I promise.
I'm sorry.
Huh?
I'm sorry I can't help you.
I'm sorry.
Let's have a party sometime.
Yeah,
sometime.
Somehow.
For sure.
Mayuri's sister!
Mayuri's sister!
Huh?
It's not true.
I didn't want to.
I just
wanted to surprise her.
I won't let you kill her.
I will.
I will.
I will protect Mayuri.
I won't let you kill her.
I will protect her.
I will protect her.
I will protect her.
I will protect her.
I will protect her.
I will protect her.
I will protect her.
I will protect her.
I will protect her.
I will protect her.
I will protect her.
I will protect her.
I will protect her.
I will protect her.
I will protect her.
I will protect her.
I will protect her.
I will protect her.
I will protect her.
I will protect her.
I will protect her.
I will protect her.
I will protect her.
I will protect her.
I will protect her.
I will protect her.
I will protect her.
I will protect her.
I will protect her.
I will protect her.
I will protect her.
I will protect her.
I will protect her.
I will protect her.
I will protect her.
I will protect her.
I will protect her.
I will protect her.
The End
