This is Earth. 70 million years ago.
Mayuri?
We were sent here by a time machine.
It's you, Mayuri.
Mayu was looking for Ocarina.
Mayuri?
You can say that Ocarina is one of many others.
And that this is the original Ocarina.
Of course, you can also think that this is one of many others.
And that she is also original.
Besides, I think that Ocarina and Mayu will die here.
But I believe that our wish will be fulfilled.
Those Okarin and Mayu who will be on Akihabara in 70 million years.
So...
It's okay.
Ergosphere border
Okarin!
Kurisu said that she is almost done and you can go in.
And Mayushin cosplay.
Okay, let's go.

Yes, keep it straight.
Beautiful ribbon.
Right?
Do you want to try it on?
I have more.
Cosplay, right?
Not at all.
I can't wear this with others.
Done!
Ta-da!
Victory!
We had a race.
We lost.
But we are done.
Now everything is ready.
This is...
a time machine.
This is... a time machine.
It looks like a brainwashing machine.
It looks like a brainwashing machine.
It looks like an old microwave phone, but with headphones.
It looks like an old microwave phone, but with headphones.
It looks like an old microwave phone, but with headphones.
It does not look very good.
But theoretically it can send a memory to the past.
It does not look very good.
By the way, now we can use the bug.
Are you using the bug?
Yes, basically it solves the compression problem.
Yes, basically it solves the compression problem.
As I said before,
the machine calculates the signals
in which the brain stores the memory
and converts it to digital information.
It costs about 3.2 terabytes.
The time-duelling machine can send only 36 bytes.
Naturally, sending such volumes is not even discussed.
So we send the information to the bug and clamp it with the help of a black hole.
Then we send it back, and using the same method as e-mail, we send it to the past.
It's like putting a futon in a bag that doesn't fit in the closet.
Strictly speaking, not so. But for you, such an analogy will do.
Just like e-mail, we can send information to the past.
Then we use the extended spectrum of the mobile frequency to copy memories from the present to the past.
This will create you with memories from the future.
At once, you can send memories in 48 hours.
However, if the difference in the state of the two brains is too great, then an error will occur.
There is another problem.
What?
Unlike a microwave phone or e-mail, we need a subject for an experiment, or we won't get anything.
Since we have been sending memories, there is only one way to check the theory and test it on people.
That is, one of us has to do this.
I pass.
Okabe, tell me what you think.
It's not a chemist. It's Okabe.
Daru?
What?
We still don't know why the cells are connected to the brain, right?
Well, yes.
But there are no signs of damage.
That's right.
If they notice something, they will immediately take measures.
Can we overcome time?
I am eager to know this.
Then, maybe Mayu will buy bananas and we can make a temporary duplication of the bananas?
Listen, Mayu.
Bananas have no memory.
We will not conduct an experiment.
We will tell the world about this.
We will transfer the machine to a temporary duplication of the corresponding organization.
I agree.
If everyone agrees, then Mayu too.
I agree!
Hashuda asked to take a pizza, right?
Yes.
Then I'll just make a sandwich.
Wait.
What?
You said a salad, right?
Yes, a grapefruit salad.
Then what do they do in the body?
Mixing ingredients, you can get something tasty.
Grapefruit is sour, so you can mix it with anything.
No, you can't.
You can.
You will understand when you try it.
If you want a salad, then there are already prepared ones here.
You can mix it with anything.
No, you can't.
You can.
You will understand when you try it.
If you want a salad, then there are already prepared ones here.
And with a 50% discount.
It's too boring to buy already prepared ones.
That's why guys are so lazy.
And here is Karyan.
This is me.
The agent of the organization made a move.
Please reinforce.
Now.
You look just like a person who ran away from the hospital.
Your face says straight.
Finally I'm free.
I'm surprised.
I thought you would say to start the experiment immediately.
Are you upset?
Perhaps.
At the basic level, people are temporal creatures.
As Heidegger said.
Actually, I relaxed when you said that we would not conduct the experiment.
I think the others felt the same.
Hey, if we have a party, can I call Ryuko and Faeris?
This is a conference of developers.
Mayuri probably thinks that we should stop with this.
Perhaps.
But she could see us more often since then.
How we became obsessed with experiments.
It seems to me that the sooner the better.
Just warn me about it.
I want to tell my mom.
And...
My father will also find out that I am a developer of the time machine duplication.
Perhaps we will not be able to go to Aomori.
It will become a problem.
Do not worry.
I will help the members of the laboratory with their problems.
Right, right.
You just want to use me as your assistant, right?
Because you are my dear companion.
Thank you.
Ouch!
What are you doing?
I thought you had a fever.
Because you say unusual things for you.
I'm not...
I'm not grateful to you at all.
I was just polite.
What kind of tsundere are you?
I'm not a tsundere.
What about you?
You are constantly talking nonsense.
And now you are talking about companions?
What is this change?
What a fool.
I have never hesitated.
The members of the laboratory, my allies, my marriage and the rest of the world.
And that's it.
I'm so confused that I don't know what to say.
But you say.
Don't mess with me.
Excuse me.
Eat while no one is around.
That's rude.
Cold pizza is not tasty anymore.
By the way, they are all the same.
My favorite.
Why you?
Do you think you can decide for everyone?
See?
I was right to buy everything for salad.
Isn't it?
Wait a minute.
I'll cook now.
Why don't you stop her?
I tried as hard as I could.
Karin, you said that you would protect the employees of the laboratory.
Don't give up.
I'm not finished yet.
I agree.
The apple pie was a complete failure.
But maybe now.
I forgot, Aridis.
Perhaps the sweet and salty will go away.
After we eat, I'm going to retire and get married.
I'm back.
Mayuri, you're on time.
Go to the kitchen.
I...
What?
It smells good.
The pizza is already here.
I'll take mine.
Why is Kurisu and Makise here?
I'm an employee of the laboratory.
And what are you doing?
I'm an employee of the laboratory.
What's going on?
No idea.
Kurisu, did something happen between you and Suzu?
No.
She just blames me for unthinkable things.
She said I was a spy.
Actually, that's the truth.
Why are you so confident?
You have proof.
I don't have them.
But it will happen.
What?
It's a prophecy.
I know more about you than you know yourself.
Who are you really?
What are you going to do after that?
I'm sorry.
It's such a lie that I don't understand what you're talking about.
Kurisu!
Suzu!
Leave them to me, Mayuri.
Only Chimera Rock Voice can solve this situation.
Assistant!
I already explained it to you.
You didn't explain anything to me.
I told you.
Are you going to become a mad scientist?
I'm not going to become one.
You're a liar!
I already warned you, didn't I?
Watch out for Kurisu and Makise.
Yes, I heard that.
What?
You heard that?
Yes, I heard that.
And you believed her?
Yes.
No, I didn't.
But you didn't say that I was wrong.
Well, it looks like you've only made things worse.
Shut up!
Then try it yourself.
You know...
Um...
Mayuri doesn't like when people fight.
Mayuri...
I don't like it either.
Then we'll all be together.
I think it will be much more fun if we all become friends.
Think about it!
Is it a card or a virus?
You're a coward.
Your destiny is to become a soldier.
And, of course, it's all up to you.
If you doubt it, then attack.
Here's my cherry.
Girl, you're going to die because of it.
Now you have three viruses.
Tell me you give up.
And I'll give you a cherry.
Amane is too serious about this.
Akarin, don't be such a bad Sus.
It probably depends on victory or defeat.
That's how I was brought up.
There are only cards and links in the corner.
What?
I know about Kabe, I have no doubt about it.
Take one.
Ah!
She's right!
Assistant!
Are you betraying me?
Stop calling me an assistant.
I can't stand your arrogance.
I...
I won't thank you.
Mayuri will help too.
Then make some tea, Mayuri.
Of course.
Well, then...
Thank you, Kurisu.
For what?
I'm very glad you became friends with Sus.
We're not exactly friends.
But I guess you're right.
Being together is much more fun than being alone.
I talked to Kabe.
Kabe, I think you're the least complexed one in the lab.
It was the first time I saw Kabe so serious when he talked about it.
It was pretty scary.
Akarin, I'm sorry.
But...
Stop being a coward.
You and Kabe are obliged to be different.
Don't be so insincere.
It's so delicious.
I'll go plan my revenge.
Enjoy your life while you can.
This is the last dessert of your life.
Do you want to go check it out?
I'll finish it here myself.
Okay.
Akarin?
What?
I couldn't find the flashlight.
It's a Jedi sword.
It's the sixth fantastic weapon.
Don't use it as a flashlight.
But it's bright.
It looks like you're having fun.
Yeah.
The pizza was delicious.
And Sus and Kurisu were having fun.
I'm not.
Look, we've got a lot of stuff, haven't we?
I just realized that we don't have a lot of stuff.
For example?
Well, chairs.
A couple of tableware wouldn't be a problem.
Wait a minute.
As soon as we announce that we've made a temporary duplication machine, we'll get something as a reward.
That'll solve all our problems.
Really?
We'll be able to buy chairs and tableware?
Yeah.
What if I say that after we buy this, we still have money?
Then we'll have a microwave.
Otherwise, I'll miss the opportunity to warm up my lunch in the SWC.
I'll think about it.
It's strange.
It was so lonely in the spring.
The laboratory was very quiet.
All I heard was the sounds of his computer.
And now there's Daru and Kurisu.
Kurisu, isn't it?
Ruka, isn't it?
Ryuko, Suzu, Moeko.
Suzu, Moeko.
Ferris.
Brown and Nae.
Nae.
Mayuri.
Isn't that great?
Even if Mayu is no longer a hostage.
Akane, Mayu!
Bad news!
The trains have stopped!
The threat of an explosion?
Akihabara is in panic.
For those who have just joined us.
We report that the following train lines have been stopped.
In connection with the threat of an explosion.
Yamanote Line.
The Sobu Line.
The threat of an explosion, right?
What a disaster.
I need to call home.
This party is dedicated to the end of the time machine dubbing, right?
Right.
And what is this for?
Do you still have access to the Serno servers?
Of course.
I can't even get into their network.
What do you mean?
We are connected to the Serno cloud.
Everyone, you have to ...
Sorry, I'm leaving.
Suzu!
What was that?
What are you going to do, Mayusha?
Will you order a taxi home?
Well, I don't have money for that.
What?
My clock has stopped.
That's strange.
I just started them recently.
What is this?
What?
They were stopped ...
Don't move!
Hands up!
Moeka-san ...
Kiru ...
Moeka ...
Serno is taking the time machine.
Serno?
What are you talking about?
Kurisu Makise.
Okabe Rintaro.
Kashido Itaru.
You three will come with me.
Mayuri?
Shinamayuri.
We don't need you.
No.
I'm not doing this.
For FB.
FB.
FB.
Mayuri?
Mayuri!
Mayuri!
For what?
What the hell?
What the hell?
What the hell?
What the hell?
