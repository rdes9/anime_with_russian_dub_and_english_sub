Episode 1
What?
Okarin?
Why?
What do you mean?
You can touch her!
She's here!
You're not a ghost?
Do you want me to call the police?
I want to know the truth!
You were forced to come here!
What's the truth?
Are you angry?
Are you tired of living?
This is Luiz's favorite phrase!
I saw everything!
You were cut off!
Three hours ago, at the conference of Dr. Nakabachi,
Okarin was wearing his underwear.
The conference of Dr. Nakabachi was canceled.
But!
But!
Mrs. Makise, it's time!
I'm coming!
Wait!
Are you running away?
You are...
I have a name!
I'm Chimer...
...Rakaboy!
Brother Steiner!
The End
The End
The End
Paranoia of time travel
Is it possible to travel in time?
Thank you for coming today.
Thank you all for coming.
I don't often get to read lectures.
I hope I won't bore you.
She reads lectures.
So she's not a ghost.
Are you all right?
I was asked to tell you about the time machine.
In my article in Science, I touched on another topic.
But we'll still try.
Time machine?
I think it's a time machine.
Simply put, it's stupid.
And in the lecture, I'd like to tell you how I came to this conclusion.
I'm going!
Time machine is stupid, you say?
It's too early for such statements.
Okarin, don't be ashamed.
You...
I think the word too early is inappropriate here.
Really?
Well, let's turn the lecture into a dispute.
Then I'll be especially direct and everything will be understood.
Do you agree, Mr. Chimera?
Kurisu Makise!
That's all.
We can conclude that based on the theory of the time machine, it is impossible to move in time.
Do you want to dispute, Mr. Chimera?
Yes, I see.
Well, show us some interesting facts, Mr. Chimera.
That's all I wanted to say.
If there are any objections, I will listen.
Mr. Chimera.
Yes!
You're too much, Misha, you're a genius!
Stop, she must be from the office.
She ran away.
And this lecture is carefully planned.
Psychological attack on me.
No, I don't buy that.
Yanagibayashi shrine.
Eight.
Nine.
Nine.
One more hit.
Ten.
Ten.
Well done, Ryuka.
Okarin.
Mr. Okabe, that is, Mr. Rokovoy.
You forgot the password, Ryukaka.
L.C. Kongroo.
It's Kongroo.
I'm sorry.
So what do I have to bring?
Here are the packages.
I'm sorry.
I can't carry that much.
Dad gave it, and we won't eat it all.
We can't eat it all at home.
I see.
Thank you for the products for the laboratory.
They will increase our fighting spirit.
Glad to help.
I'm glad to get it.
Well...
Ryuka exercises with the sword every day.
Yes, I promised Mr. Oko...
That is, Mr. Himera.
When the magic blade of May rain recognizes you as its master,
it will reveal all its power.
Remember that.
Yes.
And you sold it well in the arms store.
It was only 980 yen.
Well, show me what you learned.
Can you drive away the demons?
Probably, but...
But...
If you need a good exorcist, turn to your dad.
My right hand was possessed by a terrible demon!
Hurry up and drive him away until he subjugates everything about me!
Okay.
Last time there was another hand.
Well, let him have this one today.
Urushibara's hand.
A girl with a voice and behavior.
I would say there will be other girls more feminine than this one.
But he's a guy.
He's taller than Mayuri, and he's so slim.
But he's a guy.
He looks great in a ritual outfit.
But he's a guy.
It's getting dark.
And he's still baking.
He's shaving his hair.
But...
He's a guy.
See you later.
Mayuri is so cool.
He can drive away the demons.
Yeah, he's the son of a priest.
I'm sorry.
Akihabara police.
Forbidden zone.
The passage is blocked.
It leads to the radio hall.
Radio hall.
Give me your bag.
You're going to work soon.
Thank you.
I'm working late today, so I'll go home right away.
Mayuri!
Did you really hear the scream?
Scream? When?
Scream? When?
Today? In the radio hall?
I don't think so.
I don't think so.
I see.
Well, then...
No, Karin.
So no one remembers.
So no one remembers.
Neither Mayuri, nor Daru, nor even Kurisu Makise.
It's open.
It's closed.
You're closing early today, Mr. Cinescope.
I asked you not to call me that.
I'm meeting with a future assistant today.
They also want to work here.
In a deserted shop with no buyers.
With an old man in the shop.
You know.
Shalom.
They say it's fashionable to greet like that.
And you're taking her as an assistant?
What's wrong with that?
What's your name?
Suzuka Amano.
How old are you?
18.
Why did you come here?
I like lamp TVs.
Then it's up to you.
Is this a comedy show?
Who is this?
This is Akabe.
I'm a fool.
I'm being filmed from above.
I'm not Akabe.
I'm a chemist.
Shut up, or I'll kill you.
I'm Renter Akabe.
Hi.
What's in the bags?
Special corn for scouts in our laboratory.
If you want to offer yourself an equal corn with small grains,
this is how fresh
the whole world will fall at my feet.
So that's what's fashionable now.
It collapsed at about 12 o'clock.
That means my radar was right.
The conference was canceled.
The murder of Makise Kurisu.
Was it really all my glitches?
Ed Chan.
John Titor.
Traveler in time in TREADY OLOLO.
CERN acquires all rights to time machines.
The machine is prohibited from having corporations and ordinary citizens.
They used the machine for their own benefit to create an anti-utopia.
I'm here to change the future.
To destroy the future under the power of CERN and free the world.
So your CERN dictators?
You're talking about the so-called gift of the deceased grandfather?
It doesn't exist.
It's quite possible to meet yourself in the past.
It's just a matter of moving world lines.
To begin with, I'll say that time is not a single stream from the past to the future.
It consists of an infinite number of parallels to the current, as if, streams of world lines.
For example, let's say a serial killer planned to kill you today.
If I come from the future and prevent a murder, the world will be divided into two.
The one where you lived and the one where you died.
So this Titor is a Japanese?
The self-proclaimed time traveler who appeared on American forums in 2000.
He said he came from 2036 to save the future.
He was famous on the Internet.
After that, several books were written about him.
Didn't you think I'd see another fool who claimed to be Titor's lover?
Here's a link to you. Go read about Titor.
Maybe he cleaned up the story.
John Titor, the results are about 12.
12? That can't be.
Of course, it's been a long time, but back then it was the same.
It's nothing for you.
John Titor, the results are about 56.
They're gone. The books are gone. What the hell?
I had a backup here.
What the hell?
Hello, who are you?
What's going on?
I'm Iris.
Where have you been?
What books?
The books about John Titor.
There were a few on the bookshelf.
Do you remember?
Where are they?
Wait, Karin.
What?
Who the hell is John Titor?
Who are you?
I spent the rest of the night looking for information about John Titor.
I think you've learned everything you could from the Internet.
But...
I needed an answer from Titor himself.
Ten years ago.
In other words, in 2000.
It's funny that you asked.
Unfortunately, I wasn't there in 2000.
And I wasn't going there.
What's this?
Hey, wait!
Wait!
Hey, hey, hey!
You there!
No, you!
Wait!
You took a picture of me, didn't you?
Look at the picture. It's for your own good.
I'm sorry.
If it bothered you...
What are you taking pictures of?
Proof.
Proof of where I was today and what I saw.
I wanted to ask you.
What?
Here.
A pretty old computer.
Can you identify it?
No.
Do you know who can?
Who is he?
Who is he?
It has nothing to do with you.
Delete the picture.
Tell me.
There is no email address of this person.
I refuse!
You...
Are you going to give it to me?
If you tell me, I'll delete the picture.
So be it.
But I'm not going to sell my friends.
I'll give you my address.
What is your name?
It's written here that your name is Rokovoy.
Izumer Rokovoy.
Give it to me.
Send me a postcard.
I'll send you an answer.
Welcome back, sir.
Okarin!
Welcome, Okarin.
Hello, Mayuri.
When I'm at work, I'm meowing my ears.
After all, Okarin looks like Mr.
Where is Daru?
He's sitting at the end.
Rokovoy, I missed you.
You promised to look for Meow every three days.
I'm sorry.
There is no break from the search for the office.
The office is completely closed, Meow.
So you have another secret advice today, Meow.
That's right.
So trust me more invisibly.
Here, Meow.
Take me with you, Meow.
No.
You can't get out of the office.
But I have my own special forbidden technique, Meow.
What?
Did you teach him?
Yeah, Meow.
After a month of hard training in the Guyan mountains,
and the price of my mentor's death,
I finally took over Meow.
You will not be forgiven.
Never.
In short, about the letter.
I'm talking to you and I feel like a loser.
Calm down.
At times, this girl and her nonsense.
And here is the daily conversation on the topic of who would talk, but not you.
Enough of you.
Your cartoons will cry.
Stop it!
Let her have a real heart, but her heart is cartoonish.
Okay, look.
Here's a photo.
This is IBM 5100, right?
IBM?
Legendary retro PC.
About a month ago, I heard that one of them got into Akihabara.
Apparently she heard it too.
So what?
No one found him.
No one found him.
Even the famous fast-moving spirit at night was not able to.
And this means that most likely there is no iron at all.
He is so expensive.
But it was sold more than 30 years ago.
No one then bought computers.
They were too expensive.
So this is a rare thing.
Girl.
I sent you a letter.
My name is Moeka Kiryu.
I've been unemployed for 20 years.
Do you want me to send you away or not?
I just talked to her.
What's wrong?
I'm glad I didn't put you in her.
This is a rare and expensive PC, but it's unlikely it's in Akihabara.
El Psi Kongru.
Sir?
And here I am.
Oh, my favorite omelet of the world.
Bon appetit.
Calm down.
The world is in danger.
Toiko Denki University.
The university laboratory analysis showed that the gel from bananas was damaged at the molecular level.
So they stopped being bananas.
And this is bad.
Why are you leaning?
I have an idea in my head.
What's the matter with the electromagnetic pulses of the microwave?
Don't forget to rename it.
What did you take it from?
A little bit of a sad genius hinted.
I took it from the ceiling.
Everything is ready.
Well, let's try it.
Banana Mayushis.
This is Banana Mayushis.
Don't worry.
I bought them for a donation from Mayuri for the laboratory.
Well, I tell you, this is her.
Come on, calm down inside and see what happens.
We won't get away with it.
Do you think we know all the power of the microwave on one banana?
Don't forget to rename it.
Don't forget to rename it.
That's enough.
We can't change the micro-order if we don't spend money on experiments.
Who else gave up this micro-order?
What? Really?
I guarantee it.
Well, it's ready.
What's going on?
It's gone.
Banana is gone.
It can't be.
It's me.
Electric code 666.
Start the freeze.
Government permission?
There's no time for that.
You talk to yourself sadly.
Wait, where did I hide it?
What? Did you hide it yourself?
I think I got it.
This is a microwave teleport.
What?
You're full of nonsense.
How else are you going to explain?
We took the banana away from the throat,
put it in the microwave, and then ...
Banana smear.
But it's tightly attached to the rest.
But we just took it off, right?
I think so.
Is this really a teleport?
Is this really a teleport?
Is this really a teleport?
Do you have any interesting experiments, Rintaro Kawai?
Okabe Rintaro,
or should I call you Rintaro?
Okabe Rintaro,
or should I call you Rintaro?
Okabe Rintaro,
or should I call you Rintaro?
Okabe Rintaro,
or should I call you Rintaro?
Bono-san, right?
Chicken...
Cheese.
Continue.
We are translating to Russian.
