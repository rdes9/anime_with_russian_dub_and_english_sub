        <pre>The third world war, the world war. In 2036, it will take 5 billion and 7 hundred million lives.
And it will start with this. This? What is it? Is it a model? Maybe it will transform into something?
What?
I knew you would understand, uncle.
You know, right? Then let's talk quickly.
Come with me.
I refuse.
Okarin?
I came here from the Alpha Line of Worlds.
For the last three weeks, I have repeatedly changed the world line, sacrificed Kurisu to return to this line of worlds.
I can't allow all this to be in vain.
I can't do that.
Kurisu-san?
Kurisu?
Oh, is this the case of Kurisu and the scientist who were cut off at the radio station?
Okaburentaro?
What if I tell you that the way to prevent the Third World War is not to let Kurisu Makise die?
July 28, 2010.
What do you mean? I don't know the details.
However, my mission pursues one goal.
Rescue Kurisu Makise and transition to the world line, not under the powerful influence of the field of tractors.
We are heading to the Steins Gate.
Brother Steiner!

Listen.
Mayusha didn't understand anything of this.
But if she...
If Kurisu-san is so important to you,
shouldn't you try to help her?
The Third World War sounds too much like one of your fantasies.
No one else can handle it.
I have nothing to do with six billion in the future.
However...
Thank you.
Let's go.
You think we'll fit in there?
Of course.
This is the best work my father did.
Okarin!
Leave your phone.
It may be connected to your phone over there.
I'll be back.
Good luck.
This is the Time Machine?
Yes.
I've been there in 1975 and 2000.
It works great.
But the fuel is running out.
Wait.
It can move from the past to the future.
Of course it can.
It's the Time Machine.
I see.
Is it because we're in a different world line?
Sit down.
We'll arrive before noon on July 28.
We can't change our location.
So if we appear too early,
we'll cause panic at the radio station,
which may affect Kurisu Makise's actions.
The first time the overloads will be painful.
Get ready.
Okarin!
What's that?
It always appears.
I think it's fragments of time.
It's beautiful, isn't it?
Let's go.
Wait.
I think I want to turn myself in.
You're a piece of trash.
Hurry up.
You can't let someone else see you.
It'll cause a time paradox.
How long before her murder?
I think about 20 minutes.
I'll prepare the Time Machine.
You protect her, uncle.
What, uncle?
Don't call me uncle.
July 28.
The day I saw Kurisu in a puddle of blood.
I came here with Mayuri
to the professor's press conference in Kabachi.
I heard a noise on the roof.
I heard a noise on the roof.
That's right.
After that, Mayusha went to buy a machine on the seventh floor.
Oh, no.
Did you call me here for this?
There are very few of them in this series.
And Mayusha wanted...
Yes, that's right.
Kurisu is on the eighth floor, on the other staircase.
It's made of iron.
It's made of iron.
Are they rare?
Yes, very rare.
If I go through here...
Excuse me.
Kurisu.
Do you know my name?
Kurisu is alive.
We met somewhere.
What was it?
Kurisu.
Do you hear me?
What is it?
Please answer the question.
It's me.
Wait.
This is the beginning of the story.
From the booklet, you can learn about the basic structure of the time machine.
We use the conference as an opportunity to discuss the basic theory.
In the instructions to the operation, it is said that you can identify Kurisu Makise.
Is that right?
Yes.
And it's also dangerous to take her outside.
If we can't find out who killed her,
you have to go back.
The same as with Mayuri.
Doctor!
What's the matter?
You know what the time machine theory is about.
Is she yours?
Black holes, world lines,
stolen from John Titor.
Kurisu will be killed here soon.
Kurisu will be killed here soon.
Is she going to show up?
Maybe she was killed somewhere else?
Maybe she was moved here?
Yes, it's possible.
Kurisu!
So it's going to happen here.
What does she read?
The time machine?
Is that why she's the key to changing the world line?
What do you want?
Dad, I want you to read this.
Dad?
Dad?
Professor Nakabachi?
After all, you contacted me for the first time in seven years.
You asked me to come to your press conference.
Do you remember?
It inspired me so much.
It can't be.
What is Kurisu?
I thought I could use it for the time machine theory.
I wanted to hear your opinion.
If you don't mind, you can use it
to make everyone who kicked you out of the academy.
They didn't kick me out of the academy.
They just got me and I left.
They just got me and I left.
I'm sorry.
Not bad, right?
Then if you don't mind,
I think we could put both of our names in the article.
I think we could put both of our names in the article.
Because you inspired...
Don't be a fool.
Go away.
I'm going to publish this article under my name.
What?
Dad, you don't want to steal it, do you?
Dad, you don't want to steal it, do you?
I don't think you'll ever do that.
Shut up!
It's so funny to call it theft.
It's so funny to call it theft.
Why are you so smart?
Why are you so smart?
Your daughter shouldn't be smarter than her father.
Your daughter shouldn't be smarter than her father.
If you weren't, I'd be a genius.
If you weren't, I'd be a genius.
If you weren't, I'd be a genius.
You're that boy.
You're that boy.
What would it mean?
So you came up with the idea to destroy my conference, didn't you?
So you came up with the idea to destroy my conference, didn't you?
I see.
Well, that's how it is.
Dad!
I'll protect her!
Chris!
How dare you get in my way!
How dare you!
Dad, stop it!
Please!
Don't you dare talk to me!
Get out of here!
No!
What can you know?
You don't know what I felt!
You don't know how humiliated I was!
What hell I went through!
If you weren't there...
Don't!
If you weren't there!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Chris!
Chris!
Idiots!
You're better than both of them!
I'm sorry I dragged you into this.
Why?
He's my father.
I wanted him to recognize me.
That's all.
Chris!
I'm scared.
I don't want to die.
I don't want to die.
I don't want to.
Chris!
Chris!
They're coming back!
Akarin!
Akarin, you're bleeding!
It's okay, it's not his blood.
It's me.
I killed Chris.
I killed Chris.
I killed Chris.
Akarin!
Uncle, I know it hurts, but you shouldn't give up yet.
We have enough fuel to get back.
Shut up!
It's all the same.
Convergence of the field from the tractors will kill her again and again.
Akarin, the phone!
A message?
Open it.
But just open it.
Turn on the TV.
Turn on the TV?
TV?
The plane on which Professor Nakanabachi flew arrived in Russia.
Despite the mysterious fire in the cargo compartment, we were incredibly lucky.
If the metal detector hadn't found this, the documents would have been lost.
What?
This is my iron ass.
Look, it even says Mayusha.
Really?
But how did it get to Russia?
It all started with this document.
Huh?
Then followed the international race of weapons and time machines.
Whoever controls time rules the world.
And it will start a world war.
5.7 billion lives on the line.
Save Kurisu Makise and change this world line.
Impossible.
Just like with Mayuri.
No matter what I do, the end will be the same.
Kurisu will die.
How can this be confirmed after one attempt?
One?
It's more than that.
How many times?
How many times do you think I failed?
I can tell you how crazy that time cycle was.
What an evil eye there was in that story.
I knew it.
I knew it would happen.
I'm tired.
I'm so tired.
Okarin, you're not one of those who stops halfway.
Mayusha is sure of that.
Okarin is the one who never gives up.
Even after Mayusha couldn't say goodbye to her grandmother,
you never stopped coming to her grave.
That's why I was able to say goodbye.
And that made it easier for me.
That's why you can't give up now.
July 28.
You were supposed to get a video letter.
July 28.
You were supposed to see it now.
After the first failure in saving Kurisu Makise.
What are you talking about?
I'm sorry I lied.
The plan was to blow up the rescue.
So now you can see this.
July 29.
What is this?
Nice to meet you.
I'm 15 years old.
It's Okarin.
The door didn't open.
So you've already failed to save Kurisu.
That must have hurt.
However, this pain has become the reason for my panic.
So, this has already happened.
We will consider this as part of the preparation.
Now we begin to implement our plan.
The plan to save Kurisu Makise and the transition to the Steiner Gate.
We have two goals.
The first is to destroy the document with the concept of a time machine.
Which Professor Nakanabachi took to Russia.
The second is to save Kurisu Makise.
If this is possible.
But it is impossible to prevent her death and change the past.
Because of the convergence of the field of attractors.
Isn't that right?
I will explain as clearly as possible.
Kurisu Makise can be saved.
You just didn't approach it from the other side.
Listen carefully.
You should not change the already established past.
You should not try to cancel what you saw that day.
If you do anything, we will lose everything.
Remember your life in the Alpha Line of Worlds.
It was only three weeks.
But you should have memories of the time spent with Kurisu Makise.
About everything you and her sacrificed to save Mayuri.
About everything that happened during this time.
You should not waste everything that happened during these three weeks.
You should not cancel them.
You want to save her because you survived in that world line.
This is the main reason.
I dedicated my life to creating a time machine.
The reason why you went so far is that we both want to save Kurisu Makise.
Therefore, you must deceive yourself.
Save her without changing the past in which she died.
Make the past yourself.
Wrongly accept the living Kurisu for the dead.
If you do this, the past will not change.
That's how it is.
What are you talking about?
Akarin, did you understand?
I know, you will understand me.
By the way, the name of the time machine is K-204.
I'm sure you know what it means.
Christina.
I gave the name to Brother Stein Ramiro, who we strive for.
Do you know why I called him that?
There is no point in that.
Exactly.
Now I will explain your task.
I will explain the outline of the operation.
Change the past without changing the result.
The past in which Makise Kurisu lies in a puddle of blood.
Okabe Rintaro finds it.
Change the past without changing the result.
Deceive yourself.
Deceive the world.
That's what you have to do to achieve Brother Stein Ramiro.
Good luck to you.
El Psi Kongro.
What was that?
Is that you 20 years later?
You have such a low voice.
Operation Scout?
El Psi Kongro, right?
It's been 15 years, and I'm still saying that?
It's like reading romantic novels.
Okarin?
I will do it.
If this is the choice of Brother Stein Ramiro.
I will do it.
If this is the choice of Brother Stein Ramiro.
I will do it.
If this is the choice of Brother Stein Ramiro.
I am the mad scientist of today.
El Psi Kongro.
Deceive the world.
That's what you have to do to achieve Brother Stein Ramiro.
This is our usual Okarin.
But I like Okarin more when he is like this.
I will repeat it again.
I am a mad scientist.
I am a mad scientist.
I will do it.
I will do it.
Deceive the world.
That's what you have to do to achieve Brother Stein Ramiro.
This is the choice of Brother Stein Ramiro.
