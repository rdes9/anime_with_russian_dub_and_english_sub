What am I supposed to eat?
Are you going to support me from the tilly again?
What?
Are you going to come back around this time?
Well, yes.
By the way, Officers are at Kurisu.
By the way, Kurisu, let's go with me. I don't really like the crowd. The crowd will only be there for the second game.
Okarin, you should go too.
Okabe, let's go out.
What's wrong with you again? From the very return, as if the water is empty. Don't you see that Mayuri is trying to cheer you up?
I know. I just can't calm down.
Tomorrow is the same day. Even if today she is safe, tomorrow ...
How many times have I told you about this?
Okabe?
I want to tell you something.
Mayuri will die tomorrow?
According to my calculations, yes. At first it was in the evening on the 13th. Every time I canceled the D-Mail, it was postponed for one day.
Tomorrow I will go with her to Kamimu. Have you come up with a way to save her?
Tomorrow I will go with her to Kamimu. Have you come up with a way to save her?
No, I'm going to wait for her death.
What?
I need to know the time of death in this world.
Then I'll make a leap again.
There is no other way.
The next thing to do is to cancel what Kiryu Moeka sent, right?
Exactly. I know what she wrote. She sent a message in which she said not to buy a new mobile phone. This time I have to send it from her phone. You go and look for her.
And I'll go with Mayuri to Kamimu.
And I'll go with Mayuri to Kamimu.
You?
If everything goes well, then I'll protect her before you even understand what you're saying. If I don't find Mayeko, I'll contact you right away.
And you can tell me everything, okay?
It doesn't matter what, it doesn't matter when, tell me.
Yeah, and you too.
Don't forget.
It doesn't matter what world you are in, you're not alone.
I'm with you.
From the assistant.
We came to Ryaku. There are too many people here, more than I expected. Save me.
Moeka doesn't answer, but I found where she works. I'll check there.
Got it. Don't overdo it there.
Kiryu Moeka? Oh, this is probably the girl who worked here for three days and left. I think that's what her name was. Address? Yes, there is. Who are you to her?
White Heights.
White Heights 202, Kiryu Moeka.
Got it.
Kiryu Moeka...
...is dead?
Are you sure?
Yes. When? Last night. The body was taken to the third hospital.
It doesn't look like she had relatives. It can't be.
Are you okay?
Murder?
Why?
Maybe her accomplices killed her before she killed Mayusha.
But...
...there are no reasons.
In that case, Mayusha can...
Tiger...
Moeka...
Moeka...
Tiger...
Hello?
Akabe!
It's...
Mayuri!
Mayuri!
The time of death is 19.52.
I'm sorry.
Akabe, did you eat that? Look at the label. It says Makise here.
Do you even hear me? Remember, you're not alone.
That's right. You're right, Kurisu.
What did you just say?
Do you know Kiryu Moeka?
Who is she?
It doesn't matter. I just made a jump.
What do you want to say?
White Heights.
White Heights.
FB.
FB.
FB.
Answer me.
Please.
FB.
Why?
Why aren't you writing to me?
Please answer me.
FB.
Kiryu Moeka.
I did what you wanted. Why?
It's me, Akabe.
Akabe.
Give me an order. FB.
Do you hear me?
FB.
FB.
FB.
FB.
No, no, no. Stop it.
No, no, no.
I will never forgive her. Never.
That bastard.
Give it back.
Give it back.
Give it back.
Give it back.
Akabe Rintaro.
This is Makise. Did you get the phone?
I stole it.
Get everything ready for the e-mail.
Everything is ready.
Give it back.
What's the noise?
Don't worry about it.
Better tell me how is Mayuri.
She took it from the store.
42 inches and turned on.
Kurisu.
Turn it on.
Got it.
Change the phone.
This model will soon be finished.
Have time to buy you one.
Give it back.
That's all.
If I send it.
Mayuri.
Kurisu.
Give it back.
Give it back.
Give my phone back.
What?
Nothing happened.
What's going on there?
You sent it?
Of course.
What's going on? The reading of the mystery has not been activated!
The reading of the mystery has not been activated!
Why?
Give it back! Give it back!
Hey, what's going on there?
Give it back! Give it back! Give it back!
I'm sick of it!
D-Mail works differently depending on who sent it.
So your message didn't cancel her actions?
Then what did I do?
The same code!
She didn't change her phone!
What do you mean? You checked the message, didn't you?
I changed my phone four days ago.
And I want to write to myself not to do this.
She sent another message.
You sent the first one right away!
But that means we don't know what's in that D-Mail!
It must be the sender!
I'll take a look!
Give it back!
What's going on there, Akabe?
Akabe!
I'll call you back!
Give it back!
Give it back!
Give it back!
Give it back!
Give it back!
Give it back!
Hey, what's going on there?
Akabe!
Give it back!
Give it back!
Give it back!
God, what are they doing?
Hey!
Oh my God, what a nightmare!
What am I doing here?
What am I doing here?
I'm sorry, Akabe!
I'm sorry, Akabe!
I'm sorry, Akabe!
I'm sorry, Akabe!
I'm sorry, Akabe!
What am I supposed to do?
What am I supposed to do to get it back?
Do you remember how D-Mail sent it?
D-What?
Two weeks ago you were supposed to receive a strange message from yourself from the future.
Why?
Tell me what was in the message and I'll get it back.
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
Can't you tell me?
Was it somehow connected to IBM 500?
With your accomplices?
Am I right?
Tell me, what was in it?
Don't you want to get the phone back?
I can't betray them.
From whom?
From this FBI?
I'm getting instructions from the FBI.
The FBI is everything to me.
So it's him who's in charge of you?
You can't betray the FBI?
Isn't it cool that you're so right?
But you know, they don't care what happens to you.
They abandoned you.
It's impossible.
They don't answer you, do they?
They betrayed you.
It's Kirito!
No!
The FBI is not like that!
What's the matter?
Tell me what was in it?
Tell me, what was in it?
The FBI is everything to me.
They abandoned you.
It's impossible.
They don't care what happens to you.
They don't answer you, do they?
It's impossible.
Tell me what was in it?
Tell me, what was in it?
Tell me, what was in it?
Tell me, what was in it?
Tell me, what was in it?
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm.
Do you know why you can tell me all this?
Do you know?
The FBI is like a mother to me.
The subject, the question, the job...
I have a machine of time.
The messages of the future are real.
Can I work with them?
Of course.
We give everyone a job that suits him.
I've never worked before.
I have no experience in any field.
It's not scary.
Let's try together.
That's what I saw!
You are...
You are...
You will end up in this room in four days.
You will die in solitude, waiting for the FB sign.
You will die here alone.
It's a lie.
It's true.
I don't think the FB will come back anymore.
They left you.
You are...
You're lying.
How long has it been?
Huh?
You've been waiting for a long time.
You don't think it's strange.
You are...
You are...
You're lying.
You don't think it's strange.
You will die right here.
No, in this dark, empty room.
No!
You killed Mayuri, and now you will die alone.
Betrayed, abandoned like a piece of garbage.
You decide to kill yourself.
And no one will come to save you.
Even the FB!
Mayuri!
I'm sorry.
You said the FB is like a mother.
But the FB is a woman.
I think...
I think...
We've never met.
And I don't want to.
If I tried, she would hate me.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Looking at this, I'm ready to argue.
You never talked on the phone.
Why are you still following their orders?
They gave me this place.
Place?
How stupid.
You are...
Old computer in the temple of Yenobayashi.
Take it immediately.
Okabe!
Okabe!
Don't scare me like that!
Were you worried about me?
Not at all!
I'm sorry.
So what?
So, the FB was stolen from the temple?
Moeka.
Where is she now?
Enough questions.
I'll cancel the e-mail as planned.
July 31, at about 11 a.m.
Right.
Don't go to the temple.
It's a trap.
It's not there.
Kido-san!
Good luck.
What's going on?
Why?
What's going on?
It didn't work.
Kiryu didn't believe in the e-mail from the past?
Apparently, she only believed in the first message.
Try again.
No.
There is only one person she will listen to.
If I send a message from his phone, she will obey, no matter what I write.
Who is it?
I'm going to find the FB.
Do you have any hint?
Even if you have, she won't tell me.
You just said I killed someone.
It's in the future.
Yes.
You will do it if the FB orders you to.
Kiryu, listen.
Even if you know that you are being used.
You will kill yourself.
Be careful.
In four days, on August 15, the very reality decided that you would die.
It's inevitable.
But I don't want this to happen.
I'm sorry.
I will fight against reality.
I will definitely save Mayuri.
