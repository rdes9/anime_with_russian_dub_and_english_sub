        <pre>5 days have passed since the collapse of the satellite.
Since this morning, crowds of people have gathered here to see the scene of the disaster.
There is no information about the origin of the object or the duration of its dismantling.
New message.
New message.
Excuse me, can I talk to you for a minute?
Did you come here to see the satellite?
Which one of you thinks about it?

The dream is trapped in the past, and the future is grieved
The only thing that is allowed is a miscalculation
There are infinite reasons, dreams and the future
The right to coexistence that we are allowed
The right to coexistence is shown by two hands
The cruel role and the choice are locked into the cage
That's why I want to cross the world line in a second
To protect your smile
Even so, I can't wait
Into the loop of time
The lonely observer is swallowed up
The paradoxical effect of the butterfly
What is it?
It's delicious!
Have you ever tried udon?
No, I've only heard about it
It's delicious!
Try putting an egg in it
How can you call yourself a fighter if you've never tried udon?
Well, we often dine here
So call us, how are you going to get here?
Oh, I remember!
Last time I paid for the food
Well, the probability of this event is zero
It was yesterday, today you are representing
Unfortunately, I don't have cash
It's me
Transfer the money from my account to the Swiss bank
What?
I'm already under the control of the organization
What a horror!
Don't take it seriously
So you went with them, Suzu?
I just had a lunch break
You should have joined us a little earlier
Why don't we have lunch together tomorrow?
I'm sure that Karina will be pleased
What?
For the membership of the organization
It will take us a week to restore the servers
Oh, it's Chris
Assistant, who are you to sleep?
Don't call me an assistant
Hey, assistant, if you've had lunch, come back to work
What is it with her?
A meeting for a round table?
Exactly
What is it?
A meeting of laboratory employees
Have we ever had something like that?
Where do you see a round table?
We don't need it
After all, it belongs to any employee
Right?
Don't decide for others
I don't have it
Don't make me carry something strange in my heart
Does Mayu have it?
Of course
Really?
That's good
But what do we do with it?
By the way, why is it round?
Are you portraying yourself as King Arthur?
I'm just a temporary employee
Anyway
It's time to start our meeting
First of all, we need to take Mayuri to the course
The course?
Secondly, for the victory over CERN, we need to upgrade our microwave
And the sooner the better
Mayu didn't understand anything
Just remember that CERN is the embodiment of evil
But how do we do it?
We managed to send a message to the past
Even twice
We don't know the cause of this phenomenon
Based on previous experiments, I can assume that the cause of those lightnings...
Exactly!
Did you come up with something?
The letters sent to the past sound too long
First of all, we need to come up with a short name
What? Another attempt to look cool?
Don't say another one!
What about the phoenix phenomenon?
Another stupid name, right?
What?
Then let me tell you
I sent a message to the past about the phoenix phenomenon
The name is...
Monster Zangief!
The path of nostalgia
By the way, this will be a journey through the centuries
You have to consider the path of nostalgia
It's too difficult!
It's rejected!
You're just a student!
You can't reject it!
Then let's vote
Who is the path of nostalgia?
Mayu!
Yes!
I think Chris is right
Mayu can't remember such a complicated name
It looks like a name invented by the best classmates
The name should be simple and understandable
Since the letters return in time, let's call them the messages flying in time
What kind of messages are flying in time?
Some kind of nonsense
What about the mail that conquered time?
Too long?
You'll remember it
It's not for you to talk about
Your nostalgia for something there is also nonsense
You say you don't understand, it's romance
You can shorten the jumps in time
You can shorten the jumps in time
But then it will not be clear what is jumping in time
Is it a letter, a girl, or a banana?
Ta-da!
Mayu's idea!
I have an idea!
What about going back to the future?
But we have letters in the past, not in the future
It doesn't make sense
Then DeLorean is even more pointless
Hey!
Maybe we should shorten it to D-mail?
D-mail is fine, isn't it?
I like it!
Well, then it's decided
If so, then let's start the experiments with D-mail
Don't forget to rename it
You can throw away your don't forget to rename it
We'll call the experiment Operation Wood
We don't need it
We don't know yet under what conditions we can send D-mail
There is a hypothesis that those lightnings are necessary
This is what we are going to check
I, Chimera Kovoy, declare
We forgot about the most obvious and most important condition
With other words, about time
The first D-mail was sent between noon and hour
The second about six in the evening
If we do the experiment at the same time, then we will succeed
Probably
It sounds too simple
But we will still try
Mayuri, banana!
Mayu has almost no bananas left
We need to put it inside
We need to put it inside
Daru, not now
I want to see if it will turn into jelly
Assistant, take the banana
Take the banana
Shut up, you pervert!
Sorry, I'll buy you another one later
Really? I'm so glad
Akarin and Daru have never bought them for me
You two, damn
Are you trying to look cuter?
No
It hurts, it hurts, get away
Thank you, Mayuri
Stop playing, Yuri, girls
Get ready for the D-mail
Okay, okay
Give us 120 seconds, okay?
Of course
Operation Urt, start!
Now!
Here it is, here it is!
Where is the banana?
It turned into jelly
The task is solved
As I thought
It's time for the key factor of the D-mail
Kami, you're just great
It was so obvious that I didn't notice
Are you jealous?
Nevertheless, I respect you for your courage to recognize my services
By the way, has the D-mail arrived?
It has
It says that five days ago
Did you send two letters?
No, one
It was divided into two
By the way, what does this message mean?
Try to figure it out yourself
That's strange
The last D-mail was divided into several parts
And one of them disappeared
And they also came five days earlier
Yes, it seems that there is some kind of connection here
This means that she
Called me an empty-headed idiot
Take yourself in your hands
So that Christina would take advantage of you
Wait a minute, why did you take so much?
All we need is Rolton de Charent
But one more pack of cheap chocolate
And you're going to ruin our success
Go, put it back
Stupid
Exactly
I was so happy with the success of the experiment
That I forgot
We found out the terrible secret of the serum
And I also got involved in this
Am I doing the right thing?
Oh
That's the movie setter
What?
What are you doing?
You don't have a mobile phone?
At the moment, the phone of Rokovoy is used in the experiment that will be included in the history.
Here I am.
Karin!
What kind of girl is this juicy, sexy, lively girl?
Let me introduce you.
This is my boss, Kiro Maeko.
Hello, Kiro!
Another reason to be disappointed in the real world.
Hi, guys, are you having fun?
Are you doing something fun already?
Of course!
We are conducting an experiment that will be included in the history.
That's not bad, of course.
But the boss is very angry.
He said that on the second floor it is too noisy.
I'll raise the fee by 10,000 yen.
That's what he said.
10,000?
Okay, I'll figure it out myself.
Daru, tell the assistant to stop the experiments in time.
Got it.
You're just shining.
Is Makise Kurisu still here?
Oh, right.
Then you were so obsessed with her.
There was something between you and her.
You already know her.
Did something happen in the past?
Nothing happened in the past.
Yes.
It was summer then.
You were eight years old.
At the dried up dock of Mississippi, a red-eyed turtle ran away from you.
There was no such thing.
I saw her for the first time yesterday.
In any case, you should talk to the boss.
What are you doing there?
The whole building is shaking like an earthquake.
We're conducting an experiment that will turn a blind eye to modern science.
Don't worry, we'll be done soon.
I told them to stop.
What are you doing?
I told you to stop.
Makise said she would bring another one and finish it.
I sent you a letter.
Do you have anything to do with it?
Of course not.
I warned you five days ago.
Don't be an idiot.
While you were away, you received a lot of messages.
I'm sorry, how are you?
I'm fine.
Did you find anything about IBM 500?
Why didn't she ask me about it personally?
What happened?
I don't know.
I don't think she needs calcium.
Whose fault is it?
I found out something about how Gmail works.
What?
Every second on the timer, the item returns an hour ago.
120 seconds equals five days.
It's amazing.
She opened the dependency between the timer and the return in time.
However, you can only send 36 letters in English or 18 in Japanese at a time.
Too little.
We need to solve this problem.
I don't think you'll be able to send a lot of things.
Maybe the reason is in that black hole.
Black hole.
It's too small.
Could you repeat this to me?
Shut up, you pervert.
Anyway, let's clarify the details tomorrow.
But now I'll tell you.
August 2, 60.
The day that mankind will remember forever.
With our laboratory.
With the development of the first working machine in the world.
Hooray!
Actually, she's not the first one.
Anyway, we lost.
Besides, we didn't develop her.
It was just a coincidence.
Hey, don't interrupt.
It's a rough day.
But Akarin.
I'm glad your experiments were successful.
Thank you.
Where am I?
Don't be afraid, you're standing still.
Space and time are changing here.
Space and time?
You can't move here.
And time has stopped here.
One second of your time is eternity for me.
Is this an extreme universe?
No, the universe is constantly expanding.
What is it?
Does the universe look like this from the outside?
Or did I decide that?
You shouldn't look.
Eternity is not endless.
Even if time strives for infinity.
The end still exists.
Maybe it will come in a second, or maybe not.
Look only forward.
Go all the way.
You shouldn't look.
I'm sorry.
Who is it?
Oh my god.
It's dark here.
I'm still sleeping here.
I'm sorry for yesterday.
I can meet you.
Didn't you think I was just sleeping?
Am I going to sleep?
What?
I'm going up the stairs.
I'm behind the door.
I'll knock.
I'm here.
Why are you in front of me?
I'm right next to you.
I don't look at him.
Just tell me.
Why did I need such a rain?
I got it.
You're a spy after me.
Why don't you tell me?
I see.
So that's why.
You're afraid of two things.
You're afraid of a crazy woman like Kimura Kapooru, aren't you?
It's easier to send letters.
Show me the IBM 5100.
Okay.
But I'll just show you how to get out of here.
Deal?
She's just a fan of old computers.
Can I take a picture of him?
It's not my face.
If you take my face off,
I'll have to get rid of you.
Can I borrow it?
I'd be glad if you'd help me get it.
Why do I have to lend it to you?
If you really want to borrow it,
tell me in person.
Can I borrow it?
Sorry, but no.
Sorry, but no.
I borrowed it myself.
As soon as I'm done, I'll return it to the owner.
Owner?
Yanabayashi Shinja.
Good morning.
Oh, we met yesterday.
You're Kira, aren't you?
I didn't introduce you yesterday.
My right hand is
Meguhatsukerdaru.
I'm a hacker.
You're a hacker.
By the way,
I've improved my microwave phone a little.
But it's still a mess.
Send an e-mail to the past.
What does it mean?
Send an e-mail to the past?
Nothing.
He didn't say to send an e-mail to the past.
He said to send an e-mail to the past.
Well, you know,
a decent apartment, two men.
What does it mean?
Oh, Karin.
You can use my microwave
to start your experiments.
Oh, I have some ideas
about time machines.
It's me.
An extraordinary situation.
No, the third person
received information about the eighth object.
What's going on?
Is he ignoring us?
We can't afford to organize.
Don't write to me when I'm talking.
Is it really...
Is it really FB?
FB?
Okay.
I'll tell you everything.
Since you've already heard everything, you can't do anything.
Kirill Moek,
from this moment on,
you are the fifth employee of the laboratory of fantastic devices.
