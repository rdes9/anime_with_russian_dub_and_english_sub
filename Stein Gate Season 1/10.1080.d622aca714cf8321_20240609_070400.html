        <pre>Why? What's going on? My culture disappeared because of Akiba?
Akarin, wait!
Akarin, what's going on?
Where is she?
Mandarake Gamers?
What are you talking about, Akarin? Why do they have to be in Akiba?
That's why I have to go after Dajin Shibukana.
Mayuri, you're working for My Queen, aren't you?
My Queen?
My Queen Nyan Nyan Nyan!
It can't be!
Mayuri was the one who promoted my culture in Akiba!
She sent a D-mail to prevent this from happening.
One message from her changed the whole city.
Brother Steiner!
The End
The End
Gumiostas Compliments
It's hard to believe that My Queen was here.
My Queen? Is that potato?
In the summer, I switch from noodles to potatoes.
That's not potato.
If My Queen never was here, how did we meet FaZe?
We met her by eating potato ramen.
What are you talking about?
Did you forget?
The day of the RaiNet tournament in Kebukuro.
I ate potato ramen for lunch and I got sick, so I left.
And then?
You and Mayuri performed instead of me.
And FaZe was against you.
You were crushed, but Mayuri and FaZe became friends.
I see.
Look, look, Ryuka.
I bought this magazine with cosplay yesterday in Nakano.
The past has changed, but there is no relationship.
So the current human relationship hasn't changed.
I'm afraid you have too much free time.
The beautiful half of our audience.
Good day.
Look, isn't it cute?
Oh, it's Sedona from Blood Melody.
How did it go?
There is even a swimming suit.
I'd like to try it on, but I don't have such a figure.
Come on, you have cosplay for flat people.
Exactly.
Why not all the members of the laboratory go to the beach?
And Kurisu too.
Everyone will be in school baths.
Okay.
I'm not going to swim next to a pervert.
In other words, if there are only girls, I will be happy to participate.
Be honest, Christina.
You just don't want anyone to see your homeland on your back.
That's why you don't go.
I don't have any homeland there.
By the way, if you say that there are only girls, then Ryukaka will not be able to go.
Why not?
I already told you.
Ryukaka is such a man.
What?
You know, you're an idiot.
How can you call a girl a guy?
I don't like it when you say that.
Think about it sometimes.
Wait, why are you crying?
Hurry up and apologize to Urashibara.
No, seriously, why should I apologize to him?
It's true.
Everything is fine.
So that's what you thought about me, Akabe.
No, no, Ryukaka, you're right.
How long are you going to break the comedy?
I'm going home.
Wait.
Are you crazy?
Look, he's here.
Disappeared.
He is not here.
Akabe, stop it.
Ryukaka, are you a girl?
I've been trying to prove it to you all the time.
I told you.
Hi.
What happened?
Don't worry.
Just the consequences of a small torture.
Torture?
Did Kurisu Makise do it?
Yes, but I'm the one to blame.
I thought.
What's wrong with your legs?
Don't touch them.
She made me sit on my knees all the time.
No, I was punished.
What?
That's not torture.
It's like you were punished.
But I'm a soldier.
Perfect weather for a bike.
That's it.
Listen.
Don't you want to ride?
This is what you call riding.
Ryukaka!
I came to Tokyo in search of my father.
In search of your father?
Did he disappear or something like that?
I haven't seen him for a long time.
I can't even remember his face.
But I know he's in this city.
Here's my only clue.
This is his badge.
Maybe then you shouldn't waste your time working.
Something's got to happen.
This is my chance.
I know where my father will be tomorrow.
If he's not there, I'll leave this city.
Actually, I have to go somewhere.
You know I'm very busy.
Although I thought I'd give up if I couldn't meet him.
You're contradicting yourself.
But I can understand your feelings.
Are you out of your mind?
Your luck disappears every minute.
And you're a crazy chemist.
From this moment on, you're a member of laboratory number 008.
You'll be our inexperienced rabbit.
What are you going to do?
Change the past.
You can think I'm cruel.
But you can't escape.
Send an e-mail to your father before he leaves.
Tell him not to leave his daughter.
You know, you're a good guy.
What?
I feel a little better now.
I have to go back.
Thanks for the talk.
Listen, it doesn't matter if you meet him or not.
No, come to the lab.
I have to use you in my experiments with the e-mail.
You're a real crazy chemist.
It's awful.
And now it's time to have a briefing before the operation.
This is from Norwegian mythology.
If she meets her father, we'll have a party.
We'll celebrate her last night in Tokyo.
And if she doesn't meet him, we'll try to make her happy.
And then we'll send an e-mail.
Where's Daru?
He's meeting friends online today.
So he's not with us.
But I'm ready for that.
I sent this message.
What will you choose between Ferris or your meeting?
But Ferris won't be able to come, will he?
Ferris is not familiar with the mission.
So you can't do anything here.
But Daru has to take part in the operation.
I've never met Suzuku either.
It's okay.
You all go to the store and get ready for the party.
And you?
I'll go with her.
And I'll keep an eye on her situation.
No.
Let your daughter spend time together.
That's right.
Let's go to the store with us.
I'll go with her.
But I said no.
Don't tell me what to do, assistant.
Do you want to sit on your knees again?
It's three o'clock.
What is it?
It's time to go to the store.
I'm watching you.
What?
What's wrong, Akarin?
Nothing.
This is...
What is it?
I think sweet curry will do.
Or do you want spicy curry?
What do you think?
I think spicy curry will do.
That's right.
Suzuku is a fighter.
If she's a fighter, she doesn't like spicy curry.
Now we need to get some meat.
Beef is so expensive.
Hey, Akarin.
You don't look well.
You didn't even say as usual.
As a result of sabotage of the organization,
the prices of beef have gone up.
The operation time sale has started.
If you use Norwegian mythology,
then it's not time sale.
As a result of sabotage of the organization,
the operation out humla
caused an unexpected rise in prices.
Please use reserve funds.
Oh, the first star.
Venus.
Hey, Akarin.
Do you remember in elementary school?
You were very cold,
and you had a high temperature.
Yes, then the world panicked
before the millennium, mom.
I was very scared.
What if you die?
So I prayed.
Just then I saw a falling star.
And I said three times,
don't you dare die, Akarin.
The next day you got better.
So I saved you.
No, you're wrong.
It was the choice of Brad Steiner.
Because of this, I got better.
Really?
Really.
I see.
And I remember what you said
when you were very bad.
Everything is floating in front of my eyes,
and I can't get up.
That's exactly how you looked
in Fairies' house.
That feeling when I had a fever.
The same as when changing reality.
That means
I got the honor of Steiner.
Exactly then.
We're back.
With a return.
Do you smell something strange?
This is Coris cooking apple pie.
What?
This?
Can you boil an egg?
Of course.
Can I use a microwave?
No.
If you put a raw egg there,
it will explode.
I'll do it myself.
Then Mayuri, cut the mushrooms.
Wait.
For apple pie,
you don't need boiled eggs or mushrooms.
They are needed for salad.
I don't think that salad with boiled eggs and mushrooms
is a good idea.
And you!
Move.
It's me.
It looks like I destroyed the seal
that kept the dark deity.
If I don't get in touch
within an hour,
tell my parents that I loved them.
Okabe,
do you have a drawing?
Fairies!
Where is Fairies?
Hasha, you've been deceived.
Fairies said that she can't come.
Really?
Hey, I'm Karin.
As soon as I get a chance,
I'll try to compensate for it.
Damn it!
I wanted to go to the forum
dedicated to the time machine.
The forum dedicated to the time machine?
It's a very famous forum.
Besides, one famous scientist
was supposed to come.
What an interesting thing is here.
Don't touch it.
My snake.
It's a glue.
It looks like this.
In fact, it's a momentary moisturizer.
My ring.
Don't pull it out.
I'm sorry, Okabe.
It can't be helped.
Don't worry.
Next time, ask first.
Can we use this?
A vacuum cleaner?
No.
It's a gadget of the future number three.
Or number two?
Number five.
It's called...
I connected something unnecessary again
with the help of Goemon.
Now it works both as a vacuum cleaner
and as a hairdryer.
Give it to me.
Wait.
When you use it,
you need to turn off all other appliances,
but where is the flashlight?
Is this it?
No, it's a remote control.
Where is the counter?
If you walk in the dark,
it will move.
So...
I told you.
The counter is in the hall.
Are you okay?
What's wrong?
I'm sorry.
But...
In the laboratory where I worked,
the best scientists from all over the world
gathered.
They were all geniuses.
But the situation was very hostile.
Compared to that,
your laboratory is a children's sandbox.
But it's very fun here.
I'm not praising you.
I just thought.
I...
I just want to spend time with my friends.
I...
I think of you
as a partner.
You told me
that now I'm a part of your life.
It made me
really happy.
Do you have a fever?
No!
What?
I'm trying to change my opinion about you,
stupid Akarin.
Suzu is late.
I hope she was able to meet
her father.
It would be great
if they were together now.
I told her to come
to the laboratory anyway.
But it's too late.
We're closing the operation.
You can go home.
I'm sorry,
I'm sorry.
Is she going to leave the city
from the very beginning?
I won't let this happen
to Hime and Rokoboni.
Damn it!
Damn it!
That's right.
If I send you a D-Mail
and no matter what,
I'll go with her.
But...
Should I send you
a D-Mail?
This will change the reality even more.
You know, you're a good guy.
Now I feel
a little better.
I'm a crazy scientist
and chemist.
What are you afraid of?
What are you afraid of?
Don't succumb
to their cruel insinuations.
Go with Suzy.
To be continued...
Hi.
Good morning, Mr. White.
You're late from work.
Last night we stayed up late.
So I'm tired.
Yesterday
we had a farewell party
for you
to become our
experimental rabbits.
That's right.
But the experiment won't work.
I don't know my dad's number.
I want to check something.
How did I stop you?
Did you drink alcohol?
You're not 21.
And you shouldn't do that.
Just answer me.
Well...
I returned from the meeting
to the forum
dedicated to the time machine.
It was supposed to be your dad.
Yes.
My dad calls himself
Titor.
John Titor?
Not John, but Barrel.
Barrel Titor.
I told you yesterday.
You didn't answer the phone?
Last night
we had a good time.
What about the chicken, Makise?
We could kill it with the pie.
But the curry was delicious.
You know, you have a cool laboratory.
All my friends and you
are always happy there.
I've never had time
to have such a good time.
Then go anytime.
We will be glad to see you.
You're a member of the laboratory, aren't you?
Yeah.
I won't stop trying to find my father.
I won't stop trying to find my father.
