        <pre>Go and buy a new one for me, Akarin.
I don't have money.
I told you that photographing me is strictly prohibited.
This is for memory.
No photos.
So, I finished the project.
Microphone number 2 from Dendy version 1.03 is ready.
Now you can use a built-in mobile phone and send a demo to any number.
Well done, Doro.
Then let's continue the experiments.
Is this really a time machine?
Just don't tell anyone, okay?
Don't you think the tenant will kick us out soon?
Hey, you!
Mayuri, be quiet!
Where is Mr. Brown?
Who is this?
Don't call my dad Mr. Brown.
Do you mean the boss?
He left on a call.
Really?
When he's not here, it becomes so quiet and calm.
Mayuri.
Okay.
This is...
Oh, I see the light.
Divergence of Singularity
Divergence of Singularity
The juicy fried chicken number 1 would have been tastier.
Hey, is Dr. Pepper here?
He's sold out.
You should have been looking for him until you found him.
That means you are a true admirer of Dr. Pepper.
He wasn't here.
What do you want from me?
Are you going to drink it or not?
What do you want?
What kind of crazy scientist drinks vegetable juice?
Let's start the meeting of the round table.
It's so hot here, I'll open the window.
Are you asleep, Garo?
What if the organization hears us?
Stop fooling around.
What kind of round table?
It's time to move on to the second phase of the operation.
And conduct experiments with D-Mail on a new level.
It's summer now, we need to drink tea.
Do you want some, Mayeko?
What are we going to do in the new level?
Change the past.
Wait, it's too dangerous.
If there is a time paradox...
Assistant, aren't you interested in D-Mail as a scientist?
Can you change the past with the help of D-Mail?
Well, what are we going to change?
Good question.
For the purpose of our experiment, I would like to...
Win the lottery.
Okarin, I'm disappointed in you.
And I'm in favor.
If we have money, we will be able to buy the necessary equipment and frequent visits to May.
Don't you think we have a slightly different goal, like saving the world?
For example, to give everyone a paupi.
Akabe, this is really some kind of a lie.
Can we change the past?
I suggest the simplest way to check it.
But in fact, you want money, right?
Shut up, Pop D-18.
Pop what?
Pop D-18.
I don't want to hear anything, girls.
I live in a hotel for the money of my parents.
I'm 18.
But there are many types of fund.
What exactly do we need?
Let's see.
Something wrong?
Oh, no.
Where is Mayeko?
Stop!
Like this.
Damn, you can't lower your eyes for a second.
Is it because you didn't pay attention to me?
I really need an IBM 500.
Please, let me borrow it.
You're like a boss.
Maybe you can do something with it?
Kristina, watch her closely so that she doesn't steal anything.
Why should I do this?
Do you want to inspect our laboratory, Mayeko?
I'll give you a tour later.
It's great for May.
I've already shown everything to Kurisu here.
Where should I start?
I see.
Rio Lato.
Every Thursday they announce the winning numbers.
We'll send them to the past.
We're really going to do it.
I have other ideas.
What winning combination will we send?
By the way, the prize for the first place is...
200 million yen.
200 million?
200 million will be a bit too much.
And the winning combination has too much attention.
The organization is looking for me.
Are you paranoid?
What's the prize for the second place?
23 million yen.
And the third?
700 thousand.
Let's go!
What a cowardly chick.
Someone was scared of the modern paradox.
Who would be afraid of this?
And this smile?
When you get tired or you get sad, just hug it like this.
We have a fridge here.
What do we have to eat here?
This is...
Hey!
You're a useless set-up.
Here's your first task as a laboratory employee.
Here's your first task.
Think about what to write in the e-mail.
What makes me buy Ryo Latoa's ticket?
7 days ago.
That's 168 hours.
That's 170 seconds on the timer.
Buy me Ryo Latoa.
You win.
Okay, we're ready.
It's time to open the door to Tainer.
You're doing your own thing again.
You just don't get tired of it.
And you stop thinking about everything.
It looks like you're having fun.
Huh?
It's not like that.
What did you say?
It's a tsundere.
Who's a tsundere?
Max, don't you know what a tsundere is?
Huh?
Of course not.
It looks like you do.
I told you I don't know.
Okay, I'm turning on the microwave.
It's too dangerous.
What if there's a time paradox?
Did I scare you?
El Psy...
Kongro...
What's going on?
What's going on?
Kongro...
It's sent.
Okarin?
Okarin?
Are you okay?
What was that?
How long have I been standing like this?
About 30 seconds?
30 seconds?
You don't remember?
We were talking about the experiment
on changing the past with the help of Gmail.
Then you ran up to the microwave
and started breathing heavily.
Mayusha, could you tell me again?
It's hard to breathe.
Stop it, you pervert.
Buy a lottery ticket, you'll win.
Here it is.
Okabe, are you sure you're okay?
Where's the money?
Lottery ticket!
I won the lottery!
Don't call me a lottery.
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
Okarin?
Experiment!
We sent an e-mail to change the past.
We just started talking about
how to conduct such an experiment.
Mayusha wants to help save the world.
Just like my ass.
Don't you remember?
Come in.
Oh, it's Ryuko.
Welcome.
Koma, I'm sorry.
Ryuko?
This is...
2, 12, 18.
Everything matches.
Ryuko, where did you get this?
Well, you sent me these numbers yourself.
Sent?
You wrote me that I would win
if I bought a lottery ticket.
When?
A week ago.
Wow, Okarin, you're such a hard worker.
Did you win Ryuko?
Well...
I made a mistake with one number.
Wow, almost!
Just a little bit more!
Okabe, you used the microwave
to...
Hey, there's no Dr. Pepper here.
He's finished.
What do you want from me?
Let's say we sent an e-mail.
But I have no proof.
The past has changed.
They don't remember the experiment.
They don't remember the experiment.
They think that we just started thinking about it.
Only I remember everything.
Only me.
This feeling is just like before.
What's going on?
What's this?
Something important.
Something's wrong.
You look like you've been brainwashed.
Brainwashed?
That's possible.
That's possible.
Did they just brainwash me?
What the...
There are no chips.
It's okay.
They didn't brainwash you?
Chips?
What does brainwash mean?
That's...
I'm a chemist.
I'll tell you.
It seems that Naya is afraid of you.
I want to ask you something.
Do you mean those chips?
You managed to recreate them.
Didn't you?
Yes, for example, that flash 10 minutes ago.
I didn't notice anything.
And you, Naya?
No.
Are you really a pervert?
I'm not a pervert.
I'm just a little worried.
You see?
I told you that everything is heard from here.
I didn't even imagine that there were so many of us.
Did you hear about the time machine?
Yes, it's cool that you succeeded.
Let me warn you.
I know no one.
Are you worried about something related to the time machine?
Then why don't you ask John Titor?
John Titor has already talked about this.
When you try to change the past,
the process of divergence begins.
You get into one of them.
At the same time, people's memories also change.
New memories are created.
D-Mail changed my trajectory in the time fractal.
Now I'm not in the same reality as Ryo, who didn't buy the ticket,
but in the same place where he bought it.
Since the trajectory has changed, so has the past.
In this reality, I didn't send D-Mail to the past
with the winning numbers of Ryo Lato.
The problem is not that the members of the laboratory don't remember about the experiment,
but that he didn't exist for them.
That's why I remember everything.
Damn it!
Nae, just don't tell Dad that I quit my job.
And you'll have to ride your bike with me.
Akabe Rintaro, I'm on your side.
Dad!
Akabe!
What are you doing here with my daughter?
W-Wait! I just...
Shut up!
You can't leave people like you alone with my damn daughter!
What the hell do you think of me?
Besides, we weren't there.
Suzuka was here too.
What?
Is that true, Nae?
I promised her, so I won't tell her that she wasn't there.
What?
What?
Hey, waitress!
I'm sorry!
Are you crazy?
You didn't get rid of 42 inches!
I-I'm sorry!
I'll explain the reason later,
but for today we're ending the experiments.
Let's wrap it up.
Akarin!
Hey, waitress!
Why aren't you going home?
What were you thinking about?
Suzuka, you'd be alone if you came back to the hotel.
So you decided to stay with me.
Am I right, Popdiva?
Don't call me Popdiva!
I need to send a message.
So sit still if you don't want to leave.
Suzuka is a zombie.
That nickname is even worse.
You're like a girl waiting for a message from your boyfriend.
You really don't have enough attention.
Who was that message for?
John Titor.
Lotteria, I'm sorry.
Ryukaka.
From the lightning-fast waitress.
You had a good time.
Next time tell me about the time machine.
Agreed?
Bye, Mayaka.
Daru?
Hello?
Akarin, I realized that I made a big mistake.
Mistake? What mistake?
Actually...
Well...
I forgot that you have your own paper.
What?
So I can't go to the Queen, May?
Akarin, you can't?
Akarin?
Oh, it's you, Mayuri.
Daru is with you?
You shouldn't give him money, got it?
Got it.
So, Akarin, do you feel better?
If not, you can hug May's ear.
Then you'll feel better.
Ah, I'm done.
Bye, Mayaka.
Good luck.
Bye.
Okabe, I'm leaving.
Okabe, are you smiling?
What's going on?
I read your message.
As you expected, the reality has changed.
Only your trajectory in the time fractal has changed.
The only thing I don't understand is why you have memories of the past.
Is it true?
It's true.
And something similar happened before.
What does it mean?
I don't know.
The theory about the change of time has not been finalized yet.
It was not discussed in 2036.
You changed the past in the time fractal this time.
But you can't prove that you have preserved your memories.
Change your own trajectory.
But, Kyouma, you may have the power.
You may be able to guide the world.
More than 1%.
More than 1%?
What does it mean more than 1%?
What does it mean more than 1%?
The message has been sent.
It means real freedom.
If you make a mistake, the future will cease to exist.
My goal is to change the future.
And you may be the only one who has that power.
Akabe, is something wrong?
What is she talking about?
I'm going to change the future.
Is that so?
Kyouma, I want you to become a messiah.
Kyouma, I want you to change the future.
And you may be the only one who has that power.
And you may be the only one who has that power.
And you may be the only one who has that power.
And you may be the only one who has that power.
And you may be the only one who has that power.
And you may be the only one who has that power.
And you may be the only one who has that power.
And you may be the only one who has that power.
And you may be the only one who has that power.
And you may be the only one who has that power.
And you may be the only one who has that power.
And you may be the only one who has that power.
And you may be the only one who has that power.
And you may be the only one who has that power.
And you may be the only one who has that power.
And you may be the only one who has that power.
