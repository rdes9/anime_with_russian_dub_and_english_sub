        <pre>5 seconds. I want you to distract Brown.
He shouldn't notice the shaking from the experiment.
I see. I just need to seduce him.
Do you want to touch him? They are hard.
I agree.
Really? Give it to me.
And how are you going to seduce him?
What did you say?
Don't pay attention.
What's up?
Okey-dokey.
Now!
Assistant, start!
What the...
Oh no, I failed.
How many times do I have to tell you?
It stopped.
Assistant, no.
It stopped.
Is it over?
Assistant, no.
What?
It can't be!
What the hell?
It can't be!
To be continued...
To be continued...
To be continued...
Dogma education in the cycle of events.
In other words, a 42-inch TV on the first floor works as an accelerator.
So the work of the TV on the first floor is the necessary conditions for sending a D-mail.
Does it explain a lot?
Don't yell. Your head is cracking.
How are you, Brown?
I didn't think he'd be able to resort to violence.
Actually, it's your own fault.
You're the only one who wanted to carry out the experiment.
But we almost completely understood the principle of the work of a microwave phone.
Then the next task will be to send the last physical object.
Impossible.
Give up so quickly!
No matter how we make the objects, they will turn into jelly.
And how are you going to get from a person to 36 bytes?
I don't think it's time to brag now.
Why did you decide that I was going to brag?
Look at the headlines.
Analysis of nerve impulses that store the central part of the brain.
Can you say so that I understand?
In short, this is where people's memory is stored.
I was engaged in neuroscience.
Simply put, the brain stores memories in the form of electrical impulses.
This is a variety of electronic information.
Information?
Just don't say it!
That's right, sending a person is impossible.
But you can send his memory.
Where?
To you in the past.
We will transform memories into information and send them to e-mails.
Simply put, you transfer the back-up of your brains to the past.
You can call this sending yourself to the past.
It's more of a duplication than a time travel.
It's me.
All lines come together at one point.
It's time to move on to the final stages.
The goddess who controls the past.
Start the operation in Verdun.
What?
You should explain your nonsense.
I say it's time to start the duplication that you said.
Right now.
But we need a lot of things.
Of course, you can find a camera to capture the memories that are in any part in Akiba.
But...
But what?
I don't think that a microwave phone will be able to convert memory successfully.
And...
What?
Nothing.
No.
Okay.
I'll make a list of the necessary equipment.
She didn't understand a thing about me.
Kristina explained everything.
We are going to send our memories to the past.
It sounds scary.
Isn't a D-mail enough for you?
D-mails are too unpredictable.
Communication can lead to changes that you did not expect.
But is it normal to send your memory to the past?
This option will lead to less and control their changes in reality.
We could avoid the changes in Akiba.
The city?
Nothing.
Don't pay attention.
But what will happen to you after sending your memories?
What will happen?
Your body will remain here, right?
Well...
For example, Maya is talking to Karin now, right?
Yeah.
Then, as you say, Maya sends her memory and then lives this week again?
What will happen if she doesn't talk to Karin at this time?
I think you would remember our conversation.
But if he didn't exist, then Maya would remember our conversation and Karin wouldn't?
I think so.
Then it would be sad.
Me?
No.
Maya.
Oh, it's Maeko.
It's Maeko.
Maeko!
You look very unhappy, lightning-bearer.
You got rid of the time machine?
We're still using it.
Now we're going to duplicate it.
Don't tell her about it.
But Maeko is also a member of the laboratory, isn't she?
That's true, but...
What kind of duplication?
It's clear from the name.
We can send memories to the past.
Memories?
Maeko?
Oh, Maeko!
Is she okay?
I think we should go to Akibao first.
Mayuri!
Oh, it's Maya!
What happened?
Are you still in this?
Maya?
Boss said to go out every day like this.
You're hurting a weak child's psyche.
I'm trying not to hurt anyone.
What?
Maya said she wanted to talk to Kabirin Toru, so we were looking for you.
Me?
I'm sorry.
My dad was really too much.
Maya?
You were looking for me just for this?
What kind of raised animal is she?
She's not an animal.
Don't worry.
I'm constantly giving Brown trouble.
We're counting on you.
This doesn't look like Kabirin Toru, who I know.
Akarin is always like this.
Now Maya will go, okay?
Are you meeting someone?
Yeah, I'm going to give Fubuki her costume for cosplay.
By the way, there will be a comic soon.
Bye!
See you!
Bye!
Okay, we have to go back.
No, I still have to find the equipment and the list of Christine.
Makise Kurisu is working on CERN.
CERN CERN
CERN CERN
It can't be.
Bull, K.
Don't sneak up on me, it's against the rules.
So you're writing in this channel.
I've long understood that the no-name is you.
No, really.
You have nothing more to hide.
Terrible.
Okay, from now on I will call you by your no-name.
Stop making strange nicknames for me.
And please keep it a secret.
Why?
You can write about it in the resume.
If they find out that such a scientist is on the forums,
they will immediately create a bunch of topics about you.
What does it matter to me?
And then you will become their wise man?
I hate myself for understanding the last suggestion.
But still, it became easier for me.
I can't imagine a spy hiding his activity so badly.
What are you talking about?
The guard said that you are a spy of CERN.
Why did she take it?
It's impossible.
Of course.
You are the agent who was sent by the organization.
But you betrayed it and became my assistant.
That's not true either.
So how is the work going?
Work?
Timing and duplication.
I bought everything I needed.
Oh, great.
I have to do this, right?
I've already gone so far.
Hey, what's going on?
Are you scared?
Are you scared?
And this too.
I still wonder what will happen if I really do it.
But there is something else.
Chiba, I have to tell you.
Perhaps you already guessed.
I can't do it here.
Let's go where I can't see your face.
What?
I have a problem with my father.
At the grassy plains of the state of Arkansas, a lightning struck your father.
And if you're going to be a fool, I won't tell you.
Okay, I'm listening.
To put it simply, my father doesn't like me.
No, he hates me.
And not as his daughter, but as a scientist, as an opponent.
My father was a physicist.
I always liked to listen to how he talked about his work.
And by the end of elementary school, I was able to understand his research.
Then I started my own and received several awards.
I wasn't worried about the awards.
I liked to argue with my father.
It was fun.
We constantly wrote to each other by mail.
And our arguments became more and more hot.
But in the end, my father stopped arguing with me.
When I was interested in the topic of the argument, I usually won it.
I found mistakes in his calculations.
And without noticing this, I hit him with his pride.
He began to slap his forehead at his mother.
He lost confidence in himself and gradually moved away from his friends, academics.
The last time I saw him, he told me.
Do you feel sorry for me?
Are you looking down at me?
You're my daughter, how dare you?
If I can make equipment for temporary dubbing.
I think my dad can go crazy.
Even more than before.
So you can't decide because of this?
Don't worry.
Despite this, I will do everything.
As you said, I like to experiment.
If I see an opportunity, I will explore it.
Just like my father.
The time I spent with him.
It looks like the present.
Then we proceed to the operation of Belldandy immediately.
We don't have time.
The organization is already one step away from us.
Is this your answer?
Of course. I'm a chemist.
My destiny is to change the world.
I shouldn't have answered him.
We will also help you make up with your father.
Where is he?
He's in Auri.
We need money for tickets.
As soon as you finish, immediately inform me.
Are you not going to go with me?
Of course.
I have ambitious plans.
I need you to achieve them.
I will go with you as a chemist.
I will use my master's skills to communicate with people.
I will make up with my father and daughter.
What the hell?
You are a self-proclaimed crazy scientist.
Since when do you have such skills?
Well, you know.
Why are you laughing?
You know, sometimes you're a good guy.
As soon as you realize my greatness, go back to work.
Yes, yes.
I'll tell you right away.
Everything is already decided.
I'll take you with me.
Do you want this or not?
Sounds threatening.
Mayuri?
Where did you get so many things?
I would like to ask for help from my Akarin.
It's okay.
I'm already here.
Look at the foil.
It says Makise here.
Actually, it's pudding Makise.
Could it be pudding Morinaga?
Or Kui Bai Pudding?
It's good to play as a captain.
By the way, who is Makise?
It's me, Kristina Makise.
If you just said Kristina, you would save a few calories.
Stop eating other people's food.
This is my spoon. Don't use it.
Don't you use the laboratory fork?
I'm here.
What is this?
Mayushin's cosplay materials and pajamas.
Pajamas?
I'm going to make several costumes for Kamiketa.
Are you sure?
What about your parents?
Kristina, you're going to stay here too, right?
To finish up the microwave and phone.
I guess so.
But there is one negative factor here.
This chimera is something that constantly eats other people's puddings.
The chimera is deadly.
Forget my name.
Who would say?
And don't ignore the pudding incident.
Maybe I should leave?
No, I'm staying.
But I have to get rid of Akarin.
What?
The laboratory is the temple of my soul.
I shouldn't leave.
And how did it come out that I went to the store?
If I think about it, I've been doing her errands for the second day in a row.
Kristina?
I demand two puddings in return for eating on you.
And because of the finances, we are going to Aomori on the last bus.
Don't confess.
Don't forget that you are a laboratory employee.
I don't confess, you fool.
What?
What is it?
Nothing.
Get in before Akarin comes back.
Yeah.
Another assistant?
You know too much.
What?
Mayuri!
Mayuri!
Mayuri!
Mayuri!
I will never forgive you! Never!
Akarin is very sad. She is very embarrassed.
Oh my God!
You not only looked at us in the soul, but also forgot about the purchase.
I can't believe it.
Hey, Akabe.
Akarin?
It's Daru.
Why are you so late?
I knew it.
When I logged in from here, I noticed something strange.
Something strange?
The lab is connected to CERN by the locale.
To CERN?
They entered our system?
It looks like it.
To be honest, I didn't even know about it.
All this time we had access to CERN.
What are you talking about?
Wait a minute.
If we are in the same local network, doesn't that mean that they found us and are watching us?
Well, I think they cleaned everything up well enough so that we wouldn't get caught.
Now we can use you as we want.
It can't be.
CERN?
Akarin?
Something wrong with your phone?
No.
Nothing.
Let's go.
What are you doing here?
I came to see you.
