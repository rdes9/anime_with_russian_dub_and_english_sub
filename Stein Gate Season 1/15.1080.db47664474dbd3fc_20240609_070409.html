        <pre>This is a time machine. I'm from 2036. Suzuka. I'm a time traveler. John Titor.
This is a time machine. I'm a time traveler. I'm a time traveler. John Titor.
This is a time machine. I'm a time traveler. I'm a time traveler.
This is a time machine. I'm a time traveler. I'm a time traveler.
An incomplete connection, not a cross.
2036. The world was being ruled by a seed.
Cruel totalitarian state. Dystopia.
People lost their freedom. They live like zombies.
Everyone who disagrees is killed.
I was in the resistance. I fought for the liberation of the world from the totalitarianism of the seed.
In order to change this forgotten reality, I used the time machine left by my father.
I came to change the future.
So everything you wrote in this channel is true?
Yes, most of it is true, but CERN is a research organization that does not seek to seize power.
You know, I wrote a lot about John Titor.
Stop! Does that mean you're the one who wrote the Kedrova nut 18 and the Eval 77 turtle?
Since it turned out who Titor is, I have to admit it, right?
Well, then I am. I am the ruler of the North. We know.
CERN successfully completed the development of the time machine.
By acquiring the monopoly on interference in the fourth dimension of time,
they cut through the map of the world.
By the way, Kurisu Maksa made the biggest contribution to the development of the time machine.
She is called the mother of the time machine.
I worked for CERN? Never!
Why should I work for an organization that conducts experiments on people?
That's what happened in the future.
So that's why you don't like me.
And I'm in the future.
Okabe Rintaro is a famous terrorist.
Terrorist?
The terrorist who fought with CERN.
And you both died in 2036.
I have to hurry.
Wait!
You told us all this and now you're going back to the future.
I'm leaving.
I'll go back to the past to change the future.
In 1975.
In 1975?
CERN will complete the development of the time machine.
At the same time with the machine developed in Akihabara in 2010.
Are you talking about the microwave?
CERN uses the communication control system to get information about time machines from all over the world.
I think the system was damaged by the first D-Mail sent to Okabe Rintaro.
The message I sent from here?
Yes.
So if we delete the message from the CERN database, the future will change.
We will be able to get into the beta direction of realities, where CERN will never create a time machine.
Will this save Mayuri?
Maybe.
Then we need to find the CERN database immediately.
To do this, we need IBM 500.
I see.
So my goal is to go to 1975, find IBM 500 and send it to Okabe Rintaro.
But I was too late, looking for my father.
I should have gone earlier.
Are you okay?
It doesn't work.
Bad news.
What should we do?
I'll think of something.
Hide!
How can you run away?
Is there anyone?
Who is here?
Back!
I'm carrying out an operation to cut off the evil plans of the organization!
This mission has a level 17 level of secrecy, so get out of here!
Here!
Faster!
Stop!
It's time!
Faster!
I don't know what will happen in the future, but now I'm like you, a member of the laboratory!
Okabe!
Are you okay?
Let's go!
What plans?
We can't go back.
So the time machine is broken?
It broke when it fell?
That's not the reason.
There was a mistake in the coordinate calculation.
I'm sorry.
There was a mistake in the coordinate calculation, and I appeared here.
When I moved, she was fine?
Then why?
It seems to me that that shower ...
Probably a lightning struck her or flooded her.
It's my fault.
By stopping you then.
Time machine!
She can only be sent for 48 hours.
This is not enough.
Oh, Karin!
Kurisu and Suzu are with you!
You didn't go home?
Mayu said that we would have a party.
In case of completion of the time machine, Daru and I went shopping.
I said that we are done for today.
I'm sorry, Mayuri.
We need to talk about important things.
And Karin?
Karin, just go home today.
We'll have another party.
Okay.
But don't do anything dangerous.
Mayu is very worried.
Everything will be fine.
I promise.
See you tomorrow!
I heard that the trains have stopped.
Right?
We need to fix the time machine.
First, go back to five hours ago.
That is, when the time machine was completed.
Then go back to 48 hours.
At 2 o'clock on the 11th.
That's our limit.
We will fix the time machine in these two days, no matter what it costs.
If I don't have time, I'll come back as much as I need.
This is not for the sake of saving the world.
This is for the sake of saving Mayuri.
The End
Akabe?
What's going on?
Gather all the members of the laboratory.
We need to talk.
The technology of the future is amazing.
It's like Photoshop.
Can you fix it?
Amano, you can't do it yourself.
Unfortunately, no.
My father made it.
We will not be able to fix the time machine of 2036.
We are using today's technology.
And we will not try to find out.
In any case, try to finish it in two days, Daru.
You are our only hope.
Why two days?
Well...
Anyway, fix it.
If you fix it, I'll do whatever you want.
Sensei, I want a date with Faerie for a whole day.
Agreed.
I'll do it somehow.
No, it's impossible.
For me, everything is possible.
Believe me.
Seriously?
Really?
I promised.
You will fix it.
Let's go!
And one more thing, okay?
If I fix the load with IBM 500,
bring me the legendary anime made using old technology.
Radical Girl Omit from 1975.
Get to work.
Me too.
No, you must make the time machine.
We need to go back to the lab.
Hey, haven't you forgotten anything?
We need to find Suzu's father.
I'm fine.
Not at all.
You used the time machine.
Since you had a task.
But you still wanted to meet your father.
So Mayu wants to help you.
Your father's name is Barel Titor, right?
That's his nickname.
I don't know his real name.
Where does Amane come from?
From my mother.
His only clue is this badge.
Your father is in Akihabara in 2010, right?
Great.
Mayu will be an investigator.
Shina Mayuri.
She's a good girl, isn't she?
Can you fix it?
I can't say for sure.
But from what I see...
She's connected to the microwave.
So there's a chance, right?
It's surprising that your father is here.
He knew we were in Akihabara in 2010, right?
Probably, yes.
But he didn't tell me about it.
I've never met him.
Everything was as he wanted.
My father developed the time machine separately from CERN.
To change the future.
I'm just doing what he wants.
I'm very sorry.
But if I can fix it,
maybe we'll find your father before you come back from 1975.
So keep this secret from Akarin and try to get it back.
This is a pretty simple way.
Despite the fact that we're in the laboratory of fantastic devices,
you don't have a more extraordinary plan.
This is the most effective one.
Fantastic device number two,
modified in the version 2.67.
It's a bamboo camera helicopter.
There's a PZS camera down there.
Surprisingly, it's practical.
We can use it to search for air.
The camera is also spinning,
so the video we get rotates at a very high speed.
The version 2.67 hasn't been fixed yet.
This is our first prototype.
But Daru decided to come up with a cool name.
It doesn't reflect reality.
Where's Daru?
He's still working.
It's a divergent meter.
You made it, so I think it should be with you.
If the number is more than one,
then the future will change.
If the number is more than one,
then the future will change.
Only you will know.
Thanks to your
support,
I was able to save Mayuri
and continued to live
like a stupid little child
in front of my fantasies.
There is no such thing.
Save the world,
a noble, bold decision.
Hey, comrade!
Hey, my crazy scientist!
This is very cool!
Bitch!
Hi!
What is it?
So, Japanese and Katia.
What is it?
It's a Japanese cat.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
It's a Japanese cat.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
It's a Japanese cat.
I want to ask you something.
Have you ever seen such a thing?
I want to know where it is from.
Look, maybe you remember.
Oh, he remembers.
Sorry, it's a little difficult.
I'm sorry, it's a little difficult.
I'm sure the Japanese cat.
Call me if you remember.
Call me if you remember.
Connor in physics
perhaps it will be created in the near future.
Not yet developed.
It's probably not my destiny to meet my father.
It's probably not my destiny to meet my father.
Let's drop the search.
It's not easy to give in.
We still have one day.
Is it important for me to save Mayuri?
I want to be the first of all.
You're a radish laboratory member and a friend.
I want to help you, too, if I can.
And yet, you're giving up so easily!
W-What's going on?
I'm sorry.
Please! Please!
It's her!
There was a kidnapping yesterday!
I'm looking for the criminal. He had a badge like this.
Please help us!
Oh, Akarin!
Look! Look!
Mayuri...
It's a good idea, isn't it?
Mayuri came up with it.
I thought everyone would say,
Oh, when they see this.
This is a big operation with Mayuri's banners.
I think the idea of kidnapping is too much.
And what if the police starts looking for us?
Wait, run!
What?
Hey, wait!
I'm sorry.
Now about such operations, I advise you to call me.
What are you doing?
Oh, it's Christina.
Are you having fun?
I heard something important.
What?
When I went to buy lunch, I heard a conversation.
Maybe Amane's father is a kidnapper?
What? What's going on?
How's it going?
Here, have a drink.
You would be so cute if you brought an ice-free cola.
Well, can we fix the time machine?
Probably tomorrow.
You've been working all this time, it's amazing.
Yes, it's a valuable frame.
Although it doesn't look very healthy and smart.
Don't judge it by its appearance.
Yes, I changed my opinion about it.
Then you can help me.
It's very hot inside the time machine.
And we, forgetting about shame, can take off all our clothes.
Shut up, you pervert.
Daru and Saku look good together.
Huh?
Together?
Where?
I don't know how to say it.
It's up to you.
What's wrong?
Don't pay attention.
Mayuri said something strange.
But if the time machine is ready, I will worry about Suzu when she leaves.
If she can stand the two of them, then I can go with you.
Why would you go with her?
Why not?
I will hold Suzu's hand tightly and talk.
Everything is fine, Mayu and you, so everything is fine.
I say this because I think that I will not have such an opportunity anymore.
What?
Are you exaggerating?
I am very grateful to you for everything.
I didn't know anyone when I got here.
I thought that this time was very calm, but for me it turned out to be scary.
And now I have a lot of friends.
I am very glad that I got here and can spend time with you.
I am glad that I became a member of the laboratory and not for long.
I am glad that I was able to spend time with you.
I am glad.
Suzuha.
Okabe Yutaro.
Change the future.
Make it free, just like this.
Suzuha.
Yes.
Hello.
Maybe this scientist is very cool.
This guy is early in the morning.
I remember.
That yesterday's badge.
Did you find her father?
I'll be right back.
Wait.
