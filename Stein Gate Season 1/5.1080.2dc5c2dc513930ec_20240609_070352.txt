Growing Pavilion
Hey, you, waitress, just go sort this out of the.
Okay.
Stop sarcastically fuming!
You said it yourself that it would be better to take a breather.
Yeah, but you need to take a breather through the step.
We need to throw the tail of the company.
No, no tail.
Rintaro Kabe!
What's this?
Do you want to know?
Actually, this is completely secret.
I would never tell you, but...
If you're going to stick around here for a long time, put it on the ground.
Be patient, assistant.
Stop shaking on him like that. Tell her and that's it.
Don't be stupid. This is the most valuable thing.
If you don't shake on him, then what is it?
Is it IBM 500?
She guessed it, Christina.
And where did you dig it up?
I found it in the Yanabayashi temple.
Where I was chosen by a gloomy genius.
I said put it on the ground.
Kurisu Makisai?
Yes? Who is this?
Yes, she works at the cinema store.
This is...
Hey, assistant!
Are you talking at work?
Why did she look at me like that?
You just look like a bandit.
Exactly as I imagined.
I see.
I'm glad you found it.
I'm not a bandit.
I'm just a friend.
I have a good friend.
I'm not a bandit.
I'm just a friend.
I'm just a friend.
I'm just a friend.
I'm just a friend.
I'm just a friend.
You understand, right?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry

without an invitation, don't be shy to come in, you're in the team, but yesterday I said that I would never come back
7 Friday per week as if I came here on purpose, I asked to help myself, so you don't like us,
no, well, I just like you, but in the box, what do you want to know,
in general, breakfast 100 slipped and began to get late, you can't
Well, now you can decipher the code.
It's not that simple. I don't know how to work on it.
I won't connect it to anything.
So, we need this iron.
You heard the order. You are my assistant.
Stop talking to me like that.
But you are my assistant.
But no.
Ocarina, go already.
Makise Wakabe is probably not in a good mood.
Well, I'll go.
Follow me, Mayuri.
No, I'd better be here with Chris and show her the lab, so that she likes it.
So I won't go.
Christina, what's wrong with you?
You don't get tired, do you, Mayuri?
No, I don't get tired.
Makise obeys Mayuri.
Oh, this is a woman's love.
Stop fantasizing, you pervert.
But girls must be friends.
Remember, you didn't want to go on an excursion.
Right.
First, I'll show you the bathroom.
There's even a shower.
However, if you wash for a long time, the water becomes cold, so be careful.
And you wash here.
Well, from time to time.
Please promise that you will never wash here again.
It's dangerous for your health.
Don't even look at me.
You'll get sick and die.
And in general, what's going on here?
Did he threaten you and you had to join the team against his will?
No, I'm just his hostage.
I'm calling the police.
Wait, she said you kept her hostage.
Is that enough evidence for the court?
No.
I went to him with good will.
What do you mean?
It's time for me to go.
Bye.
I think these will do for the replacement.
Hello.
Do you want to fix the IBM 500?
Don't say that name here.
Pick up the details.
Do you need help?
I didn't even expect that the fighter would be so good at computers.
Yeah, I knew someone who knew about IBM.
Really?
Then introduce us.
Impossible.
If you refuse, I'll turn you into a beast.
Impossible is impossible.
You're sick of living.
The thing is, this man died.
Many years ago.
I'm sorry.
It's okay. I'm sorry for what happened today.
Did my assistant do something to you?
No.
Nothing.
Maybe she was the first one to stare at you.
Oh, she was so angry.
No.
She didn't do anything.
Then...
She doesn't know anything yet.
Absolutely nothing.
But be careful.
What did you say to Makise Kurisu?
They're going to bomb.
They're filming fireworks.
It's a holiday today.
Fireworks.
Fireworks.
I've heard so much about them.
Have you never seen them?
Where are they? Where should I run?
Over there, across the river.
You can see it from there.
Thank you.
Give me the mail address.
Wait.
Festival.
Fireworks.
You said fireworks.
Do you want to go?
No, I don't want to.
Akarin.
Parampampam.
Are you going home?
Did you find the parts?
Of course.
I see.
So you're going to start experimenting.
Are you interested?
I see that it's interesting.
Just a little bit.
And I don't care about this nonsense.
I just want to find out the truth.
Sorry.
What? I'm going back to the lab.
I see.
I'll go home then.
Okay.
Kurisu.
Yes.
Will you come back?
Yes.
I'm in the team until I go back to America.
Okay.
Bye.
What was that?
You're my assistant.
It's clear that you'll come back.
She said that you've been friends since childhood.
How can you grow up in the same environment and become so detached from people?
Yes, Mayuri has always been strange.
I was talking about you.
I didn't even expect that the fireworks are so cool.
It hasn't been turned on for a long time.
I have to take it off.
I feel more confident.
Great!
I was surprised.
I was right.
You're beautiful.
What's wrong with you?
You're scaring me.
This is working clothes in the lab.
I've always been talking to Mayuri.
They didn't understand my words.
But you understand me.
Now let's get together and put our hands in each other's pockets.
Hurry up!
Like this?
Yes.
This is a pose for those who have dedicated their lives to science.
I'll give you a present.
Divide the best.
I think you're making fun of me.
Are you hungry?
Shut up!
You haven't eaten anything since you woke up.
What?
Today I'm in a good mood.
Enjoy yourself.
I owe you.
Really?
Are you kidding me again?
Of course not!
Of course not!
There is nothing else.
Only instant noodles.
You grew up in America.
I'm sure you'll be able to speak to her.
Noodles?
I wouldn't refuse.
What does it taste like?
Soy sauce and salt.
Then give me salt and a fork, please.
Now the time will come and you will lose.
Maybe you'll give up?
In the end, the card is a virus, right?
Are you sure?
Think whatever you want.
Then I'll go right here.
Well, Va-Bank?
Oh, you also like Dr. Pepper, assistant?
Well, I'm not a doctor.
Dr. Pepper, assistant?
Well, I've been living in America for seven years.
We'll have to figure something out somehow.
I'm sorry, I'm still underage.
No, no, I was talking about Dr. Pepper.
Really?
Yes.
We will learn the knowledge that Dr. Pepper has.
Stop talking to me and looking at my card.
That's it, I won.
To be honest, the strategist is bad with you.
You only develop your own plan, but you don't take into account the enemy's plan or trick.
Wait!
What?
What did you say?
I said that you are a bad strategist.
Isn't it?
Before that!
You called me a bad strategist?
So what?
I may be younger, but I can't call you a bad strategist.
No!
I'm a chemist!
How many times can I repeat it, Christina?
I'm a chemist, and I'll hit you in the head!
Well, you can also call me a bad strategist.
Are you crying?
No, I'm not crying!
Why should I be afraid of a guy who yells at me?
And then cry?
Think about it!
Daru, why is my assistant crying?
I think she just explained it to you.
So, let's add this here.
So, let's add this here.
This thing goes here, and this goes here.
Assistant!
I'm not your assistant! What did you want?
Why don't you come back to the hotel?
They won't let you in at night, will they?
Don't worry, they won't let me come back here.
Do I have to see my family?
My mother lives in America, and I haven't talked to my father for seven years.
I don't know who to go to.
They like to spend money on the hotel.
Stop your nonsense already.
It worked!
It worked!
Did you fix it?
And again the task is completed!
And where is the result?
I haven't seen anything yet.
I got a Z program.
1973?
Yes.
When was the series founded?
In 1974.
In 1975?
CERN put a special program code into IVN-5100 just for this?
It's already a mistake.
But this is possible.
Well, let's read the report and find out.
I think there is an ordinary report about old experiments, which has nothing to do with the conspiracy.
Oh, Kardenko, are you kidding?
What, not to copy you into the translator?
It's not in French.
So, time management and destruction of history.
That's right, Max, you can read in English.
Well done, assistant.
You were brought up in America for this day.
Yes, of course.
So, what else is there?
The movement between the past and the future will lead to utopia.
And this is the main goal of CERN in the 21st century.
Utopia!
Utopia!
Bullshit!
Okay, show me the rest.
I'll try it now.
From the perspective of security and experiment, this is not the one.
Busy in the program is also not the one.
Oh, here it is.
Z program.
Experience complex for traveling in time and space.
With the help of protons with high energy.
Traveling in time and space.
They are talking about traveling in time.
It can not be.
So it is.
I know, CERN has been traveling in time for 40 years.
Wait, slow down with conclusions.
Phase 1, creation of a large drone.
Phase 2, creation and setting up a lift.
Lift?
But what is it?
Well, in the news it was.
And it is called...
And it flies?
Well, if you let go of the high voltage through the aluminum and it will fly.
And what time machine does it have?
How do I know? I read what is written.
In short, they use the lift and black holes.
What else is there?
Phase 3, animal experiments.
Phase 4.
What is it?
Experiments on people.
The man is dead, not coincidental.
What are you talking about?
There were correspondence that we broke.
What else was there?
More details in the report of Jellyman.
Hello, can you find this report?
I think so, but...
Isn't it dangerous?
If this is true, we have found super-secret data.
What, are you shocked?
Just think.
We are fighting with CERN.
The super-secret account is 40 years old.
And you are going to forget about it?
And you go home.
If you find out the secrets, you will also be in danger.
You are genius, you have a great future.
Are you worried about me?
Of course I'm worried.
You are my assistant.
Thank you.
But I'm staying.
I won't fall asleep after this.
Are you sure you won't regret it?
I'm sure.
And you, Daru?
Well, I'm a cool hunker.
I'm not a hunker.
They won't figure us out.
Okay.
Then let's start the analysis.
The report of Jellyman.
From this moment on, the operation will be called the Klegyarna chest.
And there are CERN myths.
And why do we need to call it somehow?
Daru, start the operation.
Got it?
Found it.
There are only 14 files.
Open it.
Report of Jellyman number 10.
Object James McCartney.
American.
Experiment date January 28, 2005.
Z program 4.
Experiment results.
The man died by accident.
Again?
Apparently, he could not withstand the infinite compression, super gravitation, or passing through the singularity of the internal vertebrae.
A newspaper article?
It looks like it.
Look at the date.
April 3, 1921.
April 21.
On April 14, a dead man was found buried in the wall of the house.
The body of the unknown man was soft, jelly-like.
What does it mean?
It may be unsuccessful, but they moved the man in time.
Report number 8.
Britain.
Z program 4.
Experiment date February 15, 2004.
Experiment results.
The man died by accident.
October 2, 1972.
The body of a woman in a jelly-like state was found in Dharmapuri, Tamil Nadu, India.
It is believed that she was hit by a car, completely smashing the lower part of the body.
And then what?
Report number 7.
Object Mikhaili Lenk.
German.
Z program 4.
Results of the experiment.
The man died by accident.
Japanese newspaper?
May 24, 1936.
The body was found at the foot of Mount Hiei in Kyoto.
And there are 14 of them.
Do you want to look further?
No, that's enough.
Okarin!
I'll go get a drink.
It seems to have taken it.
Yeah, but why are they turning into jelly?
From what I've seen, it can be said that the gray in their experiments are using the wormhole technology.
In short, they squeezed 10 to the power of minus 21 to the power of minus 19 and sent it to the past.
This is how to shove a sponge into a drain.
The contents will simply come out.
In other words, it's a very narrow thing.
Exactly.
They tried to shove something into such a narrow gap.
Well, you have an ugly explanation.
What's ugly?
Yes, the pervert.
I see you have a rich imagination too.
Don't compare me to yourself.
What are you going to do?
Stop standing there with a pole.
I understand, you're shocked.
But since we have already learned this, we need to come to some conclusion.
Okabe?
Conclusion?
What conclusions can there be?
What?
We have a fantastic feature number 8.
Microwave new phone.
We have created an ideal time machine that is already gray.
And destroyed the old world order.
You know, you are the real psycho.
This phone is not for sale.
I don't know what you're talking about.
