        <pre>The Steiner's Gate
Who would have thought?
Episode 25. Egoistic Boreamania.
What is the future destined for me?
It's me.
The organization caught me.
What?
Do you think it's all the choice of the Steiner's Gate?
That's how it is. I was careless.
Until those two weeks, until it all started.
But I don't understand anything.
Yes, I understand.
I'll call you if I survive.
El, Psy, Kongro.
Hello?
Two weeks ago.
What?
What kind of Hawaiian costume is that?
Oh, Hawaiian.
He's from L.A.
L.A.? What are you talking about?
I just said that.
Ferris is going to participate in the Reinet tournament in America.
And she asked if we would like to go with her.
So, the United States needs the help of chemical weapons.
All the same gums.
That's how it is.
Ah, I sent a message to Kurisu.
She says she's conducting some kind of research and wants us to join her.
It looks like Kurisu wants to see you, Akarin.
Do you see?
Well, well.
It's not necessary to bring Okabe.
I don't want to see him. Is that clear?
How cruel.
And this is a good idea for future laboratories.
To get a gadget to start expanding globally.
Akarin is the same, isn't he?
America? So that's where you're going.
Don't come back.
It's supposed to be fun there.
Yeah.
What do you want, Moiko?
X6 macadamia nuts.
Everything but Moiko.
Chocolate, please.
Here they are.
What's the purpose of your visit?
Well, I think I have no choice.
How can I say this?
I am the greatest scientist of the United States.
Chaos and the Second World War.
I am the greatest scientist of the United States.
Chaos and the Second World War.
I am the greatest scientist of the United States.
Union Jack!
Hey, hey, hey!
I was just kidding.
Do you understand?
Do you understand?
Kyoma!
Damn organization.
I didn't expect them to unite with the United States to try to catch me.
You haven't changed, Akabe.
Akarin?
Do you remember Kurisu?
Oh yeah!
And who's here?
Experiment lover.
My assistant, Kristina.
I'm not an assistant.
At first I thought you were an organization agent.
I thought you were an organization agent.
An epic failure.
An invasion.
An report.
Call the police.
You haven't come to your senses yet.
Shut up.
They've shut up.
Let's go.
Wait a second.
Don't tell me you're behind the wheel.
Are there any problems?
Rukaga, honey.
Yeah?
Call a taxi.
Hey!
Why are you breathing so hard?
As if you've been working all day.
What?
Taxi.
What for?
Oh, you...
Kyouma!
Ferris!
I ordered everything you need in the motel.
Why did you cancel the order?
I can't allow the organization to find out my location in advance.
You mean the seven kings of North America?
Yes.
The seventh philosophy.
Is the Japanese-American war over?
In fact.
But we have to avoid these pointless battles.
All right.
If necessary, I will use the secret of the night desert.
What?
Have you already learned it?
It's time.
8770 kilometers from home.
I declare.
Until this body is destroyed and my soul reaches Valhalla,
I will fight in the fields of Ragnarok.
For an assistant, it's pretty good.
You can stay here until you find another place.
Don't come in here so easily.
Don't drink without asking me.
It turned off.
Hello, this is Julia Wood.
We know each other.
Just like in the good old days.
It's so relaxing.
It's so relaxing.
It's so relaxing.
It's so relaxing.
You really like being in that laboratory, don't you?
What kind of life is here?
The same.
You didn't write a theory about the car, did you?
Oh, you mean the parallel worlds that you talked about earlier?
After all, there may be memories of other lines of the Earth.
You don't have to worry.
All I remember is that you saved me in that building.
Then I wandered in search of you to express my gratitude
before I finally found you.
Are you really sure you don't remember anything else?
Of course.
Okay then.
Hello?
Did you find him?
Yes.
This is...
This is a motel!
Bye.
Stop!
Are you going to leave us like this?
I can't find you another place with your budget.
But a motel is a place where aliens take control of people.
It's a place where crazy people with hockey masks attack people.
You didn't confuse reality with fiction, did you?
Maximum autism.
I know, such things only happen in the movies.
But still, I'm scared.
I probably shouldn't leave Mayuri and Urushibaru in such a place.
Mayusha will sleep with Akarin, so everything is fine.
I always slept in Akarin's room when I was little.
In his room?
What are you imagining?
It was only when she was little.
I'm ashamed of you.
Shut up!
In any case, I won't let him sleep in your room.
Well, Urushibaru...
He's a boy too, right?
Yeah.
Okay, then I'll stay here too.
So, Akabe and Hashida will sleep in one room, and Mayuri and I will sleep in another.
And I'll be alone?
I'm scared.
Okay, then Hashida will sleep in one room, and Mayuri and I will sleep in another.
Akabe and...
I don't mind being dark.
But he's a boy.
It seems that Mr. Makise will always be alone.
Well, Ryukaku and Mayuri together are pretty good.
Suddenly lesbians.
Huh, huh.
Hold on to yourself.
Besides, if there were lesbians behind the wall, then this room would be...
Get out of here!
Hey, Akarin!
What?
Come on, Akarin, I need some paper.
Who will sleep in the car?
What happened?
I left my place of sleep.
Super Hatsuker, my precious friend, as you can see.
You lost rock-paper-scissors, didn't you?
What about you?
Well, I just...
Hey!
Can you come in for a while?
I want to ask you something.
Is this really Diet Dr. Pepper?
Why don't you take him as a witness?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
If you take into account the exchange rate now, then you'll get a cheaper price.
Okay, what do you want to ask me about?
Information about the organization or maybe...
Stop or get out of here.
I remember that I was told that already.
Already?
To another place and a different timeline.
Don't worry.
That's what I wanted to talk about.
I'm a little skeptical about these other lines of the world that you told me about, but as you said, I see things in my dreams that have never happened to me, for example, to cheer you up with the news in Akihabara, to write theories on a white board, to sew up your lab coat somewhere in the dark.
Many fragments of your memory have not yet appeared, right? So it was all true?
How can I say? See, answering your questions is a little difficult now. It would be better for you in this world to say that all this is a dream.
But they all happened in other worlds.
Yes.
That's how.
Hey!
In that case, enlighten me!
About what?
There is another strange dream.
You and I, well, in general ...
What?
We ...
Something is wrong? Do you need to go to the toilet?
You pervert!
Akarin and Kurisu are getting along well, aren't they?
On the count of one, two, three!
Finished!
He saved the weapon, and Faeris won the tournament!
I did it!
Faeris! Faeris! Faeris!
He's a guy, but who cares?
And you are popular!
Your order is a rice omelette.
Stop! And what about a kawaii meow at the end of the offer?
Why would I do that?
Dear assistant, don't you respect the culture of Japanese waitresses?
Aren't you ashamed?
I didn't sign up for this, and besides, I don't want to do it!
You have to help here to pay for the plane ticket.
So I came to help you.
And when did someone pay for my ticket?
One for everyone and all for one.
Then you work too!
Seeing how energetic you are, you probably slept well last night.
You looked worried.
Nothing. I was just interested.
Well, actually, that's not it.
Forget it.
You have nothing to do with the memories of events that happened in other worlds.
I know.
I don't want to forget all this.
Exactly.
Sorry for being late.
Suzuka?
Suzuka!
Why is Suzuka here?
I remember what she said at the end.
Thank you very much. Let's meet again in seven years.
Masha has not yet been born and raised in this world.
She should not exist for another seven years until she is born.
But she is here.
Is there a time machine in this world too?
Maybe the third world too?
What?
There is no AKB here?
I saw how he flew out of the building.
I saw him go out of the venue.
Girls, someone saw him get into a taxi.
And he looked thoughtful.
Did something really happen?
No, he must have come up with something.
Kurisu?
Did you follow me all the way?
So you're not alone?
Well, I came here to participate in the Reinet tournament.
And now I'm going with a friend to Las Vegas.
I see.
But following a girl is a legal matter.
But she must be very expensive for you.
The girl looks like me.
Yes, she is dear to me, friend.
Do you know where she is now?
She is not here.
But I will see her again in seven years.
I'm sure.
Oh, how romantic.
I was told that in the next seven years I would get married and have a child.
Something wrong?
No, I don't pay attention.
I apologize for taking your time.
It's okay.
See you.
Yeah.
Seven years later
Seven more years.
I don't think I would believe it either.
Oh, 67 cents.
The battery is dead.
I'll go back.
It was two hours ago.
Kurisu.
Damn it.
I'm not going to lose.
I'm a crazy scientist.
Chimera Rockabye!
I'm not...
I must...
tell her...
I must...
Tell me what?
Great, now I have some problems.
What are you talking about?
This is a reality reflected in the cells and interpreted by my brain.
I finally found you.
If you were going to save someone, first you had to make sure that the gasoline was enough.
I'm not to blame, I was in a hurry.
What about your cell phone?
In the car.
Who would have said?
The phone itself has 67 cents and a cut phone.
And how were you going to get back?
I had an important business.
I was following a man who I knew before.
Who you knew before?
Yeah.
Wow.
I thought you ran away because of what I said.
What?
What are you talking about?
No, nothing.
Well, when I said I wanted to forget everything.
You're talking about this?
Don't interrupt.
This is very, very important to me.
Important?
I mean...
I just told you.
There was another strange dream.
I can't stop thinking about it.
It's too realistic to be a dream, so it's real.
What?
I said it's real.
For me.
What do you mean?
In another timeline, I said I love you.
No, I really love you.
What about you?
You're terrible.
We probably spent a lot of time together in another timeline.
But for me, everything I did there was just a dream.
It's hard to accept.
I have the ability to remember all the other timelines.
That's why I know.
Those three weeks we spent together.
No, it was much longer.
Longer than three weeks.
I know that because I've been with you for so long.
No matter what timeline, what time or where I am.
I'll always love you.
I'll say it again, Kurisu Makise.
I love you.
What about you?
Now, at this moment.
What do you feel about me?
I...
I...
I...
I...
I...
Do you really want to know?
