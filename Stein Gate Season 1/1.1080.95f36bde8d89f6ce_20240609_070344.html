        <pre>There is a beginning in the universe, but there is no end. It is immortal.
There is also a beginning in the stars, but their heat leads them to death. They are mortal.
Those who were considered fools are surrounded by great wise men. There are many examples of this.
I can say the last warning from God to those who are still against it.
Oh, Karin!
Let's go!
The origin of the beginning and the end
We are approaching the Zone. El, Psy, Kongru
It's not crowded. The office must have taken care of it.
What's going on here? You didn't know where you were going to go?
A time machine? Great!
Dr. Nakabachi ran over our team and is holding a conference on his invention of the century.
I want to hear what he has to say.
Earthquake? No, it's from above.
What is this?
And you called me for this?
This issue was almost sold out, and I have no coins left for 100 yen.
You've been spoiled, Mayuri. Even though we've been friends since childhood, I won't give you money.
Get used to how cruel life can be.
What do we have here?
A painting.
Metal!
It's metal! Metal!
Is it rare?
Yeah, it's very rare.
Okay, here you go.
Can I really, Karin? Call me the Chimera the Rock.
Thank you, Karin. I'll be waiting.
I'll be waiting.
I'll be waiting.
Karin, call me the Chimera the Rock.
Thank you, Karin.
I told you to call me the Chimera the Rock.
The conference of Dr. Nakabachi begins on the eighth floor.
Please take your seats.
To understand the principle of the time machine, look at the materials in front of you.
And I will explain the basic theory to you.
Before that, all the research was focused on...
It looks like I've lost my steel ear. I'll go look for it.
Now there are more than ten theories.
The principle of the time machine.
There were a lot of discussions and opinions about what it should be like.
Doctor!
Why did you jump in?
You're still asking. Is this a time travel theory?
Black holes? World War?
You just recorded the history of John Titor.
The one who in 2000 was screaming all over the Internet that he was from the future.
And you heard about her?
Of course I heard about her.
Don't get in my way with this fake.
Well, then you can definitely show us the difference between your theory and Titor's theory.
Let's go.
It's true. I read something similar in Titor's book.
Who are you?
I can ask the same thing.
What?
Well, you wanted to tell me something a couple of minutes ago, didn't you?
A couple of minutes ago?
Well, 15 minutes.
What the hell?
Makise Kurisu?
Kurisu?
That was your article in Science.
Do you know about her?
Of course I do.
You're a university scientist.
Oh, you!
Didn't the office send you?
The office?
What are you talking about?
I just wanted to find out.
I won't tell you anything.
It's me. I was found by an agent from the office.
Yes, Makise Kurisu.
Who are you talking to?
No, everything is fine. I'll sort it out somehow.
Huh?
It's turned off.
I guess I'll tell you the truth.
It's a software for special tasks.
It turns off if someone else is holding it except me.
I see. You were talking to yourself.
Okay, let's get down to business.
What did you want from me?
15 minutes ago you tried to tell me something.
You were very nervous, weren't you?
I can see you through.
Well, Mrs. Genius scientist,
next time I won't let you down.
Goodbye.
Wait!
What was she talking about?
Did I meet her?
Oh, Karin!
Mayuri!
Where have you been?
I was writing to you.
I can't find my steel mouth.
I even wrote my name on it.
Did you find it somewhere?
It looks like it.
Well, forget about it.
They sell it for 10,000 on the Internet.
10,000?
Hurry up and find it!
Our lab is already in trouble.
Even if we find it, I won't sell it.
We'll buy all the details for 10,000
with all the fantastic devices.
I told you I wouldn't sell it.
What?
What's that?
Get out of here!
Hey!
Who's there?
Is anyone alive?
Kurisu Makise!
What?
What happened?
Karin!
What's wrong with you?
You're so pale.
The man is dead.
Dead?
On the eighth floor.
To whom?
To Daru.
It's a mess.
Someone came to Kurisu Makise.
What?
What?
Kurisu Makise
What's going on?
Here you go, Karin.
Karin!
What's going on here?
What are you talking about?
People! Where did they all disappear?
How did they disappear?
They all disappeared around us.
I didn't see it.
You didn't see it?
You saw it, didn't you?
I didn't see it.
Why are you saying that?

Damn you!
This is a laboratory of fantastic devices.
Let me introduce our employees.
So, employee 001.
The founder of the laboratory, a gloomy genius.
I am...
Chimer Rokovoy.
Akarin still sounds affectionate.
Shut up!
Rintar Akabai is just my pseudonym.
Next, employee 002.
The only girl in the group who sews cosplay costumes.
My decision!
I am Mayushii.
Finally, employee 003.
Cool Hatsker and Taku Hashida.
I'm a hacker, not a Hatsker, boss.
That's the whole team.
Enough already.
What do you want from the program for 500 yen?
So, to find us, go down to Chuo Dori.
Turn left in front of the metro station and Hiroshi.
Go to the city of Maya Dori.
In the first alley, you will see a residential building.
Our goal is to change the existing world order.
In short, we are inventors.
Got it?
Got it.
Go to us and reveal all your secrets to me.
Hey, hey, Alpaca Man, maybe we're just a game for Alpaca Man?
The essence of the difference between the game and reality is not realized.
Just like you with your cartoon girls?
Not at all.
They are like my relatives.
Everyone does not care who is your relative.
Although the idea is interesting.
Maybe we are actually inside the monitor?
Can we somehow accurately determine where the reality is?
No.
Quickly decided.
In short, such thoughts will not lead to anything.
It would be better to think about how to set up an office and deprive them of world power.
He started his charm again, damn it.
Shut up, cool hacker!
I am the devil's gloomy genius, Chimera.
Rockaboy!
He made up a good story.
Well, Jidaru, you should listen more carefully to others.
Here is a daily conversation on the topic of who would say, but not you.
By the way, the news seems to have arrived.
Today, around noon, a huge object similar to a satellite fell on the building in Akihabara.
Look, as you can see, even from the ground it looks impressive.
What the hell is this?
This morning, Mayuri and I went to the radio hall to listen to Professor Nakabachi.
But I did not have time to remember how the satellite fell.
The artificial satellite crashed.
And in addition ...
Really?
Yeah.
When you saw this satellite on TV, you said, well, the office finally made its move.
We were walking together.
Did you cancel?
Well, you got angry this morning when you found out that the professor was scared and left.
But he was in the hall.
Started reading at noon in the radio hall.
But you did not have it.
And thank God.
Otherwise, the satellite would have crushed.
What a mess in my head.
Did the office erase my memory?
I got it.
So they decided.
Steiner's Gate!
What, a new story?
I do not go into your Steiner's bambas.
Daru, give me a fantastic
You made Al Pacamena angry.
There was no need to switch the channel.
What would you like, Mr. Steiner?
Anyway, he got free.
Daru, bring the TV.
No, it's hot today.
And then if I'm fat, I'm not necessarily strong.
I found something to be proud of.
Mr. Steiner!
I asked you to call me Tennoji.
I want you to fix the device immediately.
Have you already broken it?
Do not you like steiners?
You are a thing.
You did it anyway.
They put me a defective ...
If you ask me to fix it, then maybe I'll pay.
Mayuri, stop messing with him.
But I'm a hostage to Akarin.
Oh, well.
This part also flew.
It will pull on two things.
What? You don't like it? Take it home.
It's me.
It seems that the office has even reached the bald.
They have already started to break the equipment.
Take it.
Only Dr. Pet you will drink.
This drink is great genius.
The cicadas are singing beautifully.
Hello.
The office has reached the bald.
Mr. Steiner, break my TV.
It was the last drop.
Enough of me.
We begin to act according to the plan.
Plan? What else is the plan?
Well, the same plan.
I'm about to activate step number 8.
What else?
Ah, microwave phone.
Do you know how to work with microwaves?
We have known each other for three and a half years.
I would say that for two years.
We did not communicate from the eleventh grade when we were thrown away.
The essence is important.
Anyway, it's an orderly term.
Could you already learn to sing for my thoughts?
Please follow my conversation.
It's impossible.
Well, okay, let's try.
I'm ready.
Mayuri, bring the bananas.
Are you going to melt the bananas again?
Translate the products.
You will be greedy.
The office will never be defeated.
Who needs your office?
I bought them.
I know.
Says microwave phone RENG.
Please set the timer.
Enter the numbers, then press the grid.
One, two, zero, grid.
Funny, the stand is turning.
By the way, it's turning in the opposite direction.
The opposite?
This is obviously not for nothing.
If you look at it at the quantum level, the Kunda rule could be nothing.
No, no.
The same result.
It didn't get warmer or colder.
My hot one burned.
Whatever happens, everything is connected to the Steiner's gate.
25 again?
Daru, do you want some bananas?
No, thank you.
Then I'll ask Mayuri.
Melted bananas are watery and soft.
And tasteless.
Have you tried it?
Mayushii.
Tell me, your banana is very soft.
Okay.
Your banana is very soft.
Don't let her go.
Damn.
Damn, I'm melting.
We only went out 10 minutes ago.
I don't go to Filisto anymore in the summer.
If only he had performed in the Queen of May, meow-meow.
Can you imagine performing in a maid cafe?
If I didn't have a chance to shine, I wouldn't go.
It's so fresh here.
As if I lived.
The satellite said and fell.
Are you still talking about this?
Daru, do you want to jump into the radio hall?
There's a lot of people there.
We won't see anything.
We'll read them from the Steiner's gate.
Oh, they covered the center for a while.
Did something else happen?
By the way, I remembered something here.
Give me your phone.
What?
Hands off.
You don't have to read other people's SMS.
I wrote to you.
Well, that Kiris and Max were killed.
Oh, last week?
Last week?
I also divided the message into three parts.
It's terribly annoying.
Here.
Date of sending.
July 23, 12.56.
Do you see?
Last week.
Sent messages.
Not here.
What number is it today?
28.
What is it?
I sent a message to the past.
What?
To be continued.
