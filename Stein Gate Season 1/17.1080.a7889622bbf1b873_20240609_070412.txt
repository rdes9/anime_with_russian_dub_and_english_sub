Yesterday, after my return from Mr. Brown, nothing happened.
Moeka and her gang always appeared on Friday the 13th.
Did the world change when we sent a message that told me not to go after Suzuka?
If so, then...
In the end, Mayuri...
And now nothing will happen?
Huh?
My watch stopped.
Strange. I recently started them.
Brother Steiner!
The End
The End
The End
The End
What happened?
What did you want to talk about?
Help me.
Mayuri will die in two hours?
You duplicated yourself over and over again, and every time you saw her death.
It must be painful.
Considering what Amane said, we need to go from the alpha direction of reality, in which we are now in the beta direction, in order to save Mayuri.
To do this, we need the IBM 500, with which we will remove the data from CERN about us.
However, the IBM 500 that was in the Yanabayashi temple disappeared when the world switched to another line.
The world has changed due to the sending of the following emails.
The lottery.
Kiryu.
Urushibara.
Ferris.
The stage that talks about Amane.
When you canceled what stopped Amane, the attack shifted for one day.
This means that if you return and cancel the other emails, you will be able to return the world to the line where we have the IBM 500.
Right?
But this is only a theory.
It does not have any scientific basis under it.
But if there is...
At least some chance.
I understand that even though I suggested it, it will be quite difficult to cancel all these emails.
But there is no other way out.
Be careful.
Your brain is a very valuable sample.
Is it clear?
It is able to store memories despite the changes in the line of reality.
And you are able to survive duplication.
We have to.
Thank you, Kurisu.
You called me Kurisu.
I will not forget this.
What?
Nothing.
Following the reverse order, the next message that needs to be canceled is Ferris' email.
Hello.
Hi.
Do you know where Ferris is right now?
Ferris.
Ferris.
Ferris.
Ferris.
Hello.
Do you know where Ferris is right now?
I am Senpei.
Where is she?
At the UPX Arena.
The final round of the Reinet has just ended.
Reinet?
To cut the long championship of the accepted Reinet fighters.
This tournament is for Reinet fans all over Japan.
It has just ended with its victory.
I am so excited.
After sending the email to Ferris.
Akiba will be the place of electronic sales again.
I don't know what was in that message.
Who was it sent to?
What did she write?
Touma!
Ferris!
What's going on?
Neko-Defu is now with some kind of lab.
Don't let her go!
Don't let her go!
Don't let anyone escape from my dark army!
Who is chasing you?
Virus attackers.
Virus attackers?
They are the worst Reineters who are ready to give their all for the victory.
They are just crazy about the fact that Ferris lost and set up an ambush.
I found the ambush!
I found the ambush!
Where did she go?
Was she somewhere here?
Yes.
You...
By the way, it wasn't you who called me.
That's right.
I wanted you to tell me about your D-Mail.
D-Mail?
The message that you sent to the past.
The message that I sent to the past?
What was it about?
In this world...
Ferris doesn't remember sending a D-Mail.
Well, you know...
Here they are!
Here they are!
Hypothetically speaking...
Hypothetically...
If I say that we built a time machine, will you believe me?
I'll believe in everything you say.
Right?
Ferris also recently made a teleporting machine.
Let's imagine that Akiwa was filled with Moe.
What?
And you used the time machine to return it to the electronics supermarket.
How would you do that?
What game is this?
Which one do you want to play?
Just answer!
I really don't know.
But I'm ready to argue that my city would be more fun.
Actually, I once asked my dad about this.
About opening a maid cafe in Akiwa.
But he didn't allow me.
You mean my queen?
How do you know the name?
I didn't even tell him about my dad.
It existed!
Here, in Akiwa!
My Akiwa was everywhere!
Kyoma?
And you loved this city like no one else?
But one day you sent a message that changed the whole city!
What did you send?
Please tell me!
There they are!
Over there!
What's wrong with me?
Ramen!
Here!
This is the place where my queen was!
The cafe you wanted to open!
You worked here!
I worked here!
And Mayuri too!
Daru constantly came here!
This is where we met!
Welcome, master!
I'll bring everything right now!
And now we have started the distribution of the Fairies Cup!
Here is my world in danger!
How many masters came today!
It was so much fun!
Fairies!
I'm okay!
What will happen if you can't cancel the D-mail?
Mayuri's life...
...in danger!
You're lying!
You're lying!
What do you mean by saying that her life is in danger?
Did you complete the message?
Please tell me!
I'll try to cancel it!
I can't do it!
Why?
Mayuri!
You don't care that Mayuri will die?
Of course not!
It's just...
Fairies!
I returned to my father's life...
...who died ten years ago.
I changed the past...
...to prevent his death!
Kyouma!
Kyouma!
Your beautiful weapon is broken, dude!
And you, princess, will come with me!
Let me go!
Kyouma!
Hey, we caught some girl!
My super dangerous aura!
When will you see him?
You'll see him!
He says he trusts you!
And while we...
Enough!
Only one can be the main role!
Phoenix with black wings!
Let her go!
Kyouma!
Hey, dude!
Do you want to play some more?
Please, stop!
Stop!
Fuck you!
Dad!
This will be the last thing she sees!
Stop!
What are you doing?
The time has come!
C-203 is already here!
What?
Who are you?
Huh?
Police?
Arrested?
Thank God!
Thank God you're okay!
Dad!
Thank you!
I heard you won.
I came to the party, but I didn't see you at the IPX Arena.
And you didn't answer the phone, so I went looking for you.
And Kabe-kun, I don't even know how to thank you.
There's no need to thank me.
If I came to watch the tournament, this wouldn't have happened.
Dad!
Dad was working!
Everything is fine!
Rumih!
IBM 5100?
Yes.
I know you don't have it.
But where is it now?
Can you take it away?
This is a problem.
I gave it to Hashida.
Hashida?
Hashida Suzu?
Did you know her?
She gave me IBM 5100.
Everything will be fine.
I'll find IBM 5100 and get it for you.
Suzuha...
She got it for us.
Dad, can I tell him?
But...
He saved my life, he really needs to know.
Rumih was kidnapped a long time ago.
Huh?
The company wasn't as big as it is now, and I couldn't get a ransom.
And then someone came and offered to sell IBM 5100 for a lot of money.
So that's how you lost it.
Thanks to that, I was able to get the right amount.
Since then, I've always kept my promise to this daughter.
The smallest promise, no matter the circumstances.
Dad!
Dad Rumih.
I brought back Dad, who died 10 years ago.
I changed the past to prevent his death.
If I cancel the de-mail, then he...
Akarin, are you sending a de-mail?
If you do that, then everything will disappear.
But if I don't do that, Mayuri, then you...
May I come in?
Of course.
Ferris?
Well, thanks for saving me.
I was really scared.
I've never felt so dark before.
From so many people.
They were all in black.
But I'm serious.
Sorry.
Ferris, what happened?
Call me Rumih.
Kyouma.
That is, Akabe-san.
If it weren't for you, I can't even imagine what could have happened.
Don't worry.
Call me as usual.
Anyway, Kyouma.
Thank you very much.
Now you're my prince.
Your prince?
I'm not a prince.
I'm a madman.
Mayushii.
Is it true that Mayushii is in danger?
Yes.
Ten years ago, on my eighth birthday,
Dad promised to take me somewhere.
But because of work, he canceled everything.
I know he couldn't do anything.
But I was so lonely.
I decided that he didn't love me.
And said that I hated him and wanted him to die.
And then...
It turned out that this was our last conversation.
I sent a D-mail to change the past.
Your daughter bought 100 million yen from us.
So he escaped the catastrophe.
And you didn't create my culture in Akiba.
And Akiba remained just an electronics supermarket.
I was happy.
These ten years...
Rumiha, I'll cancel this D-mail.
Dad died in a disaster ten years ago.
That's what really happened.
These ten years were just a dream.
During the time I spent with him, I realized how much he loved me.
And Mayushii is my friend.
I shouldn't be selfish.
Are you sure?
No.
I'm not sure.
I remember what happened before the world changed.
But I also remember what happened after the world changed.
It all mixed together.
And I don't think I can say which is more real.
Maybe there's another way.
I know, I asked Purisu.
No, I don't want to create problems for you.
You're really my prince.
It's time for me to wake up from this dream.
But let me do something...
Can I cry a little?
Of course.
Ferris?
Yes, she agrees.
Be ready.
And here I am, meow!
What's wrong, meow, Kyouma?
You're looking down!
Kidnapping is a joke.
I love you, daddy. See you soon.
By the way...
If the world returns to the same state as it was, all my memories will disappear.
Your memories and after the world changed, right?
I'm sure they will remain.
I'm sure I remember.
Good.
Ferris doesn't want to forget the time spent with Kyouma.
I don't want to forget.
Thank you.
Ready, Akabe?
Bye, daddy.
Kyouma!
Did you see my cell phone, meow?
Ferris!
Mayusha said she didn't see it.
So you're the only one I can ask about.
Kyouma, did you see what was on it?
If you saw, forget it.
It should remain a secret forever, meow.
Kyouma, why didn't you ask anything?
I think it's there.
Ferris!
Hey, hey, hey!
Get your hands off her!
Did you think of some kind of perversion again?
Akarin is so brave.
Kyouma and Ferris fought with the great darkness.
Like lovers, together in the past life, meow.
We were so close, meow.
You defeated a lot of enemies, right?
Is Ferris really the same as Akabe?
I'm sorry.
I didn't find IBM-5100 in the temple.
Ten years ago, Ferris gave it to the temple.
They said it was there until last year.
Where...
...did it go?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
