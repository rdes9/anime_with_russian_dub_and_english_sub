        <pre>The last experiments have proved that the D-Mails really go to the past.
But I still couldn't beat Faeris in the Cup.
There are problems in you, not in the D-Mails.
Of course, there are shortcomings, for example, the problem of Ryukaka.
But if you try, we will get a real time machine.
Time machine?
You're a spy after us.
Faeris just brought your order.
Do you want me to add milk to the tea?
Milk?
No, thanks.
You can ask for anything you want.
Here it is!
The secret technique!
Movement that doesn't take your eyes off!
I'm so jealous of you, Karin, that you...
Kouma, what were you trying to say about the time machine?
Do you think that by seducing me, you can get secret information?
I changed my mind and asked Kouma.
Darunya!
Do you think that Darunya can betray me?
We built a time machine that can send letters to the past.
That's too much!
Letters to the past?
To be continued...
To be continued...
To be continued...
Chaos Theory.
Gomeostas. Part 2.
Stupid Darunya.
Sending secret information to strangers.
Why? Why do you perceive it like that?
Did I just want to...?
No, I didn't mean that! I...
What?
I didn't cry!
It doesn't look like I cried!
Actually, you definitely cried.
Your eyes are all red.
No!
Something got into them.
And what is this? A soap opera?
It doesn't matter! I didn't cry!
So, no questions! Do you understand?
I seem to be silent.
I didn't cry!
I didn't cry!
I didn't cry!
Do you understand?
I seem to be silent.
Shut up!
Kristina, don't talk to me!
I just want to say that you are now a part of my life.
If you want to talk, I will listen to you.
Okabe.
As I planned, she fell in love.
Now I can get rid of all the dirty work on her.
Thank you for the work.
Faeris.
Are you going to my place?
Yes, he asked me to bring him lunch.
Hey, Mayusha, have you seen the time machine?
The time machine?
Oh, you mean the microwave phone?
Microwave phone?
Flies out of it in all directions of lightning!
It's so scary!
It's a little scary.
Wow! It looks like the time machine from the movie!
Yes.
But Mayusha doesn't like it.
I don't want her to do that.
Why?
I feel that Ocarin is moving away from me.
Let's start the meeting!
Ocarin, Ocarin!
Well, doesn't it seem strange to you?
Mayusha says it's not a cosplay.
And this is not a cosplay, this is her school uniform.
Today I went straight from school.
What a great school uniform!
Come to it more often!
This is sexual harassment.
You shouldn't listen to it.
Here's your portion, Ocarin.
Thank you.
Wait!
We have a round table meeting!
But you asked me to bring you lunch.
Don't pay attention to him.
He probably doesn't have anything important.
Try to repeat this after you learn the topic of our meeting.
Physical travel in time!
Mayuri, do we still have all-purpose tea?
Wait a second!
I can't sleep!
It's me!
The organization has started an operation to track down our equipment.
I'm the head of chemistry and I order you not to let them reach their goals.
Do they really need that?
Then why do you ignore my meeting?
You're offering something impossible, aren't you?
We can only send letters to the past.
There must be no other way.
We can send 36 bytes of information plus information about the address.
Three messages, six symbols.
No more.
If you're so sure, why don't we experiment on you?
Or are you afraid to turn into jelly?
Ocarin's jelly?
It's really disgusting!
CERN experiments have revealed difficulties in sending past physical objects.
Even using the biggest tank in the world, they have not succeeded.
What can we do with such equipment?
How can we send letters then?
I don't know.
That's the problem.
As I said, for sending to the past, CERN uses accelerators and black holes.
The principle of the microwave phone operation is the same.
But there is no accelerator in it.
And what can we do?
I don't know.
We are also very limited in the time limits of sending emails.
And in general, we are not 100% sure that we are really sending letters to the past.
Before we continue, we need to get answers to these questions.
What?
99.9% of science is boring.
If you call yourself a scientist...
I'm not a scientist!
I'm a crazy scientist!
No, I just started to take him seriously, and he turned out to be...
Maysu?
You're not...
No way!
Shut up!
I didn't mean to say that!
It's impossible!
Let's get back to our discussion.
By the way, about the task.
How is the progress of the documents in the CERN server?
Huh?
Sundero!
I told you it was over!
I don't think so.
It's over!
Nothing particularly interesting.
I see.
Okay, the next one is...
Sundero!
Stop calling me that!
Dero, how is the delivery going?
Nothing new.
Until I figure it out in their programming language, we won't find anything new.
How is the IBN-5100 analysis going?
It would be great if I could...
What do you mean?
What?
You haven't started the CERN yet?
How can I?
Where is the IBN-5100?
How do I know?
It can't be!
Akarin, what happened?
Christina.
Could it be that we've found the IBN-5100?
We don't even know where it could be.
Yasnina, if I believe you, we can find the IBN-5100.
Yeah.
We brought it here together.
But only you remember it.
D-Mail probably changed the reality.
Changed the reality?
But we sent it to the outside world.
Butterfly effect.
The sending of letters to the past will lead to a change in the trajectory of the time fractal.
From the reality where we didn't buy lottery tickets to the reality where we bought it.
Initially, a small effect...
Creates a chain reaction.
And we enter a completely different world.
This is a well-known danger of travel in time.
So, where is the IBN-5100?
Let me ask.
Where was it then?
Yes, when I asked my dad, he said the computer was here, but...
He went somewhere.
I see.
What exactly?
It's true.
The IBN-5100 had the IBN-5100.
But now it's gone.
Nobody knows where it went.
It's a dead end, isn't it?
But it's strange to sacrifice the computer to the temple.
I have an idea. Who could have thought of such a thing?
Ferris!
Nyanya!
I've written 10 questions to our maid.
I think I'm ready for the next competition.
Let's see.
If it could go back to the past, what would you do?
What would you do, Ferris?
What would you do, Ferris?
What would you do, Ferris?
What would you do, Ferris?
What would you do, Ferris?
What would you do, Ferris?
Let me think.
Ferris doesn't care about the past.
Let's go.
The duty of a maid with cat ears,
who brings happiness to everyone, is to go only forward.
Oh, the phone.
Yes, it's Ferris.
Puma.
The computer?
The IBN-5100.
Did your family take it to Yanabayashi?
I don't remember.
Probably, yes.
My father had a lot of old computers.
Puma.
Is it somehow related to the time machine you were talking about?
Look, look!
It's an uppo!
A metal uppo!
You still want a metal uppo?
Still?
Stop standing around, let's go.
Wait!
Daru!
Here I am!
What did you buy?
I found a limited edition that I couldn't buy.
You must say that the Steiner's Gates provided us with a meeting.
And I use them for such trifles.
By the way, why did you buy it?
I don't know.
As soon as I heard about the destination, I realized that this was my sacred duty.
I also want to have some fun.
I wonder why Ferris told me to come to her house.
It's Kirari!
Mayuri, wait!
Oh my God.
IBN-5100.
A lightning-bearer!
Mayuri, wait!
Lightning-bearer!
Mayeko!
Kirumaeko!
Why?
FB said he was here.
Akabe?
You said you were going to IBN-5100.
Do you know where he is?
You know where he is, don't you?
You don't know?
You don't know?
I don't know.
You don't know?
I don't know.
You don't know?
I don't know.
Okarin!
Oh, Mayeko!
Yes.
Okarin!
Mayeko is so tall and beautiful.
I'm sure she would be a great cosplayer.
Mayuri, do you know where the lightning-bearer is?
Of course.
How do you know?
How do you know?
You took her to the lab.
After Mayeko sent a D-Mail, everyone forgot about her.
Then after Ryuko sent her own D-Mail, everyone knew about her again.
The world is changing after every D-Mail message.
The world is changing after every D-Mail message.
Are we here?
Yes, we are.
It looks like we're on the last floor.
The owner will be out soon.
Wait a little bit.
The palace is not for me.
It's a real palace, I've never seen them.
Look, people downstairs are like ants.
I like it.
I like it.
I like it.
I like it.
I like it.
Akarin
I thought he would say it.
Excuse the surprise.
Firis
Firis in regular clothes?
What a luck!
Firis-nyanya
I have to ask you an individual question.
Firis-nyam
Firis-nyam
Stop fooling around!
If you don't want to explain, then I'm leaving.
Okay.
This whole area belongs to the Ferris family.
So, Akiba...
Exactly.
What? Akiba?
This is the real name of Ferris.
Aki Harumihara.
I didn't hear the real name.
Ferris! Ferris!
An unsuccessful attempt to escape reality.
By the way, Ferris was the one who introduced Akiba to my culture.
It can't be!
She works as an angel in My Queen?
To spread my culture?
What a nobility!
I'm going to cry now, because I found out the truth first.
But you keep it all a secret, right?
I want you to keep calling me, as usual, Ferris Love.
Of course, I promise!
Thank you, nanny.
It's none of my business!
So, what about the IBL-5100?
Oh, that's what you're talking about, nanny?
But first, I have a small request.
Do you want to close the deal?
It's not that difficult, nanny.
I just want to send D-Mail once.
Of course!
When will you be satisfied?
Wait, you can't send D-Mail to strangers.
Why not make Ferris a laboratory member?
Wait, wait!
Send a letter to the past?
Why did you send D-Mail to play money in the lottery?
And you don't want to send Ferris one?
Just one!
No, that's not it!
If I refuse now, there is no guarantee that I will be able to get another IBL-5100.
As long as I'm connected to Ferris.
All right.
But, as Mayuri said, you will have to become a laboratory worker.
From this moment on, the current laboratory member will become...
Akihara!
I don't want to hear anything!
Done!
Are you sure you want to send this to 10 years ago?
Absolutely not!
And what's written there?
Well...
It's a secret, nanny.
Tell me!
As the head of the laboratory, I have the right to know.
No, private life of a maid is not available to you.
It seems to me that reading letters from strangers is not good.
I agree with Dost!
I give up.
Then get ready to send a message.
Hello?
It's me.
By the way, here...
She threw a phone to her!
And why am I not surprised?
This is Christina.
She forgot that she is just my assistant.
Hello?
This is Chimera Rokoboy.
Just don't hang up.
Chimera?
Oh, Kabe.
I thought they were mistaken for a number.
Actually, you have my number displayed.
Well, your voice seemed so scary to me that I hung up.
So you scared the little Chimera Rokoboy?
I remember today!
No, well, did you see?
She hung up again!
Akarin, again?
Akarin, maybe you'll give up already?
No!
What a cold-blooded, perverted botanist you are!
Hello?
Listen, you...
Hello?
Hello, my name is Takabe Rintaro.
What do I owe you?
I will be extremely happy if you turn on the microwave and phone.
Don't forget to rename it.
And you will set the time that I sent you.
You should have said that from the very beginning.
And in general, this is politeness.
You must be very embarrassed.
And stop adding your don't forget to rename it.
Shut up, you pop diva!
I tried to be polite, but you...
They get along well with each other.
It seems to me that they have something in common.
I agree.
Send.
Send.
Maybe...
Maybe I shouldn't do this.
Ferris!
The process has started. Send.
Send.
Um...
Who are you?
Dad!
Dad?
Did you talk to me again today?
Yes.
I have to go.
Have a good time.
Ferris's dad is so exquisite.
Of course.
Of course, it is immediately clear that this is her father.
Um...
Do you know anything about IBM 500?
I haven't heard this name for a long time.
I'm looking for it.
Unfortunately, I haven't worked with it for a long time.
Did you give it to my Shireen?
Shireen?
No, I didn't give it to her.
All the best.
Shireen
Before Ferris sent the e-mail,
I found out that IBM 500 disappeared after I got to Yanabayashi Shireen.
But now it wasn't even there.
Every time I send a message, we change the reality.
Something else had to change, but I don't know yet.
Maybe something irreparable has happened to us.
Akarin! Akarin!
Mayu is going to Nakano to buy an iMech.
iMech?
Nakano is far away.
Yes.
Then we have to go to Toranoana.
But...
But...
But...
But...
Toranoana!
What are you talking about?
Toranoana is there!
What are you talking about, Akarin?
Akina is not Akina.
Shireen!
Shireen
