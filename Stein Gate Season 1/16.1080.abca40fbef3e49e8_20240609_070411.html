        <pre>Yes. Could you make me a Bejig? The same one you brought.
He asked you to make a Bejig.
Tell me more about him. What kind of person is he?
What kind of person? Well...
He's like a barrel.
Who?
Like a barrel teeter?
Teeter?
No, no. Just like a barrel.
Like a barrel?
In Japanese, a barrel is a taro.
A taro?
Long ago, when I worked on Rai Net Anime, there was a monster series that looked like a barrel.
Yes. Just a taro.
Or a ball.
He looks like a barrel or a ball?
How can we contact him?
I'm sorry. Private information. I can't say.
No hints, right?
But if his Bejig is ready, won't he come after him?
He was told that it would take at least a week, so he canceled the order. I understand.
So it's better to just give up?
No.
There is one way.
If I wait until the end of the time machine, if I jump into the past...

NECROSIS
Sacrificed Nekrosis!
Where is Suzuka?
Hasn't she just left?
Why are you asking?
I'll tell you later.
Damn it!
I forgot to ask when that man will come.
Hey, welcome!
Is that him?
He was right.
He looks like a barrel or a ball.
Daru?
Ocarin!
Oh my God!
Why did you need a fake Bejik?
It would be a pity if she didn't take her father away, wouldn't it?
That's why I decided to show her Bejik on behalf of Titor.
Do you want her to be happy with lies?
There are two types of lies.
The first one is harmful, and the second one is not.
Do you really think that Suzuka will become easier?
Misamon asked me not to tell anyone, but...
The time machine can only send to the past.
But if you make a jump, you won't be able to come back.
How are you?
Here, take it.
Oh, you brought me my favorite diet coke!
Thank you!
So, can I fix it?
Yes, tomorrow it will be ready.
Amazing, can I fix it?
This is Daru's merit.
I told you not to judge people by their appearance.
Did you really say that?
Although, despite the fact that he looks strange and stupid.
Yes, I changed my opinion about him.
Then help me!
And then, being in the very heart of the time machine, we can forget about prejudices, take off our clothes and...
Shut up, you pervert!
Daru and Suzuka get along so well.
I wanted to say for a long time, I don't think I can admit it later.
I am very grateful to all of you.
When I arrived in your time, I was very lonely.
And even though this age is very calm, for some reason I was very scared.
But now I have you.
I am happy that I spent all this time with you and went on this journey.
I had a lot of fun.
Especially, I am glad that I became a member of your team.
Although not for long.
I am glad that I met you.
If you make a jump, you will not be able to return.
Chimera is a ghost. Change the future.
I will do everything to change it.
The world of the future will be as free as ours.
Akarin, don't you feel sorry for the memories?
You will have to forgive us.
Maybe it would be better if we didn't meet at all.
Don't you feel sorry for them?
Hashida and Daru told you everything.
He is also worried.
I will do it anyway.
My father wanted to change the future.
And you don't care about your own fate?
Well, the seventies are not so bad.
I will try to make friends as good as you.
So, let's get started.
I think everything works, but it's better to check again.
It seems to work.
You are really a master of your business.
You should be happy.
You just managed to fix the time machine.
1975.
I wonder what day of the month should I move?
What day?
Chankinjitsu or Tamabiki?
In these days, weddings are usually played.
Well, maybe you should choose Tamabiki.
So you can make friends faster.
Friends would be nice.
FG204?
Hey, Suzu!
Yes?
What is this?
This is the name that my father gave to this time machine.
Ah!
My bicycle?
I thought it could fit if I removed the wheels.
After all, it's very expensive for you, isn't it?
Yes, I'll take care of it.
Thank you.
I got it!
Mayusha got it! Who is your father?
What? And he is very close?
Where?
It always seemed to me that you two would be a great couple.
But now I understand everything.
It's all because you are a father and a daughter.
Do you mean...
Father Suzu-san is...
Daru-kun!
What?
That's not funny.
Even the idea that this pervert can get married...
Hey, I don't think it was cruel.
Explain, please.
How did you come to this conclusion?
First of all, the barrel means Taru, right?
Taru-Daru.
Daru-kun?
What?
That's the only reason.
But Akarin and John Titor were part of the group that helped with the resistance, right?
And in 2010, in Akihabara, they worked together on the time machine.
Her father knew about Ainar Akarin.
What Ainar?
Well, he knew about it.
Only Daru could know about all this.
And the last, most convincing evidence that Mayusha found...
The name of the time machine?
FG-204.
Future gadget.
Future gadget?
And there's an addition on the right.
And there's an addition on the right.
FG-204.
Future gadget.
The second edition.
Version 231.
That's the name.
Father.
You'd better say, daddy, since you found me.
Just don't show your perverted nature.
Father.
Yeah?
I'm here.
I came here to meet you.
And the time machine you created helped me.
I'll do what you dreamed of.
I'll definitely do it.
Just watch.
Yeah, I'm watching.
I'll always be watching.
By the way...
Was your mother cute?
I like the little one with a baby face and a big chest.
Let it remain a secret.
Then I'll go.
Yeah.
Don't forget Mayusha and everyone else.
Be careful.
Everything will be fine.
I'll find the IBM 5100.
And bring it to you.
So please, change the future.
See you in 35 years.
Although it won't take more than half an hour for you.
Suzu-san!
Thank you and goodbye.
Suzu-san!
Let's do everything we can to meet!
I'll work hard!
And you too!
Good luck!
Witnesses claim that the satellite that fell on the radio station Akihavara disappeared.
Hey, do you think the initials from this sign could be yours?
O from Akabe, H from Hashida, She from Shiina.
Then M as in Max, and A is Amane, right?
Bejik, laboratory worker, right? Do you want to order?
Good idea.
Akabe, is something wrong?
The data from the master of distribution has not changed.
The data should change when Amane brings the IBM 500, right?
Now Suzuha is already 55 years old.
My daughter is older than me by 30 years.
Perhaps she got married and she already has grandchildren.
That is, I can see my own great-grandchildren?
Then you should behave like an adult, you are a great-grandfather!
She is here!
Mr. Brown?
Akabe Rintaro.
Letter?
Hashida Suzu?
Is this from Suzu-san?
Really?
Why do you have it?
This is a letter from someone who once cared about me.
She asked me to give it to you today.
Where is she?
Died.
10 years ago.
Akabe Rintaro, so much time has passed.
It's me, Amane Suzuha.
Perhaps it's been no more than half an hour for you.
But today is June 13, 2000.
And now to the point.
I failed.
I failed.
I failed.
I failed.
I failed.
I failed.
I failed.
I failed.
I failed.
I failed.
I failed.
I failed.
I failed.
I failed.
I failed.
I failed.
I didn't make it.
Just ten years ago I remembered who I was.
The past 24 years I couldn't remember anything.
Time travel didn't go as we planned.
Attempts to repair the car weren't a success.
But Father wasn't to be blamed.
I should be blamed.
I should have moved to 1975, not to stop in 2010. I was too selfish. Now we can't change the future. I didn't get the IBM 500.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Why did I live? I forgot my duties and did nothing. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Akabe Rintaro, when I tried to move to 1975, after that meeting, you stopped me. That night it was raining and the time machine broke.
If you can go back to the past, I ask you not to stop me.
My life wasn't worth a penny.
Mr. Brown, what happened? You look strange. Please tell me how Hashida-san died.
Why are you asking? I should know.
It doesn't look like ordinary interest.
But how are you related to Suzu?
We are old friends.
I don't know anything about him.
I don't know anything about him.
I don't know anything about him.
I don't know anything about him.
We are old friends.
Very old.
But I still remember her well.
I don't want to say.
She committed suicide, hung herself in her room.
About a year before her death, she had psychological problems.
But even earlier, she was nice and kind.
It's my fault. The time machine broke. Because it rained.
I shouldn't have sent that e-mail. Then she would have moved to 1975.
Okarin!
Hey, Okabe, what are you doing?
If everything goes right, then Mayuri...
Okarin, are you sending an e-mail?
If you do that, the real thing will disappear.
I know.
All our memories about Suzu will also disappear.
I know!
So please change the future.
Okarin!
What's up, Okabe?
Hashida Suzu? I haven't heard that name for a long time.
Did you know her?
Yes.
But she is still...
It happened about 10 years ago.
She helped me a lot.
I would like to be with her when she went to another world.
Did she commit suicide?
No, she died of old age.
I live with her at home.
This bike...
No!
She always loved him very much.
I couldn't get rid of him.
He was here for all 10 years.
At first we were neighbors.
And then my house burned down.
I lost everything.
And she offered to live in her house.
She lived alone all her life?
She never got married.
And she was a little strange.
One day I asked her why she helped a completely different person.
And she laughed and said...
Each of us will help a completely different person one day.
That's why you don't refuse to help anyone.
Oh, that's right. Wait a minute.
This was Suzu-san's stuff.
You don't know what number it is?
She was constantly looking at it, even in the hospital.
These are the data before or after the measurement.
Could I change them?
Whatever it was, she was worried about it until the last day.
The numbers have changed.
But not more than 1%.
The train is arriving.
Please don't cross the yellow line.
Yamanote Line works at this time?
Mayuri!
Damn it!
Mayuri!
Mayuri!
Is something wrong with her?
Nothing.
Oh, Mayuri called. Did you want something?
Maybe it was Okarin?
She slept so soundly that I didn't wake her up.
Suzuha...
Has the world really changed?
Mayuri...
Did I save Mayuri?
Mayuri...
Mayuri...
Mayuri...
Mayuri...
Mayuri...
Mayuri...
Mayuri...
Mayuri...
Mayuri...
Mayuri...
Mayuri...
Mayuri...
Mayuri...
