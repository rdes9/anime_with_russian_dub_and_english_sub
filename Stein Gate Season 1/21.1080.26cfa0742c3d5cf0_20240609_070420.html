        <pre>If I return to the Battle Line of the World, Kurisu Magise will die.
I'm starting a break-in. Wait!
A break-in.
We won't do it.

Where's Akabe?
I don't know. I was busy.
Good luck.
You too, Daru.
Today is the last day of the commemoration.
Kurisu, do you want to go?
There are a lot of cute cosplays.
I'm not interested at all.
I wonder what Karin thought.
I have no idea.
He said that he would cancel the break-in and nothing else.
What did he come up with?
They say George will be 35.
Drinking water is the best remedy for a heat stroke.
Aren't you going to the commemoration today?
I'm just leaving.
Be careful there.
The sun is too hot. Bye.
Mayuri.
August 17.
Each cancelled D-Mail postponed Mayuri's death for a day.
D-Mail cancelled Suzuhi and postponed her from August 13 to August 14.
Ferris, Furukaka, Moeka.
Since each of them postponed her for one day,
Mayuri will die on this World Line on August 17.
Today is until 8 p.m.
Karin!
Did you find what you were looking for?
Yes.
It was almost sold out.
I also took it for Daru.
By the way, there is a book with a laugh and I think you will like it.
Do you want to go?
No, I don't want to.
But why? You've already come.
I need to think about something.
Here it is.
Tell me if you want to see something.
Okay.
Are you okay? Do you want to go home?
What are you talking about?
I wanted to think about the mercenaries, organizers and those who hide here.
I need to do something to get away from them.
If I'm not careful, they'll get me.
I'll act as planned until evening.
I don't think there are such bad people here.
I'll find out everything.
Meet me here at 3 p.m.
Agreed?
Yes.
Karin!
They sell juice right there.
5 hours left.
Don't give up.
Find him before this time comes.
The way to save Mayuri without changing the World Line.
Assistant.
What do I need to do to help the horses?
A notebook?
A pathfinder?
I don't see anything like that.
A stand?
A second shelf?
Don't look at the second shelf.
She really bought it because he was arrested.
What else?
It's me.
What's going on with the break-in?
You canceled it.
So no one was doing it?
Explain what's going on.
What happened?
Mayuri will die today.
I've heard about it.
Is that why you started the break-in?
To erase the first e-mails you sent?
It's not like that.
We're not going to do that.
I was going to think of a way to save Mayuri without a break-in.
Why?
Everything has changed.
This is the only way.
What has changed?
I can't explain it right now.
There must be another way.
Some other way.
Some other way?
Please.
Explain it.
Until you explain it, I can't think of anything.
I can't help you.
There's no time, right?
It's time to tell everything.
THE END
We're finally back.
Okarin, let's go to the lab.
I came up with something for dinner.
Okarin, are you tired?
No.
It's almost time.
It's almost time for her next death.
Mayuri, can you run away?
No.
It never worked.
Okarin, let's go.
Hey, Okarin, why did you come with me today?
You hardly went to see something.
If you wanted to look around, I could show you everything.
There are not many things that Mayuri knows more about Okarin.
Okarin?
Thank you for coming today.
We've never been to the Kome together, so Mayuri is happy.
Mayuri.
I wanted to see Ryukaku embarrassed by his cosplay.
But I didn't have to come.
If he came, he could become really popular.
And then Ryukaku could post his photos in all blogs.
And then he would become a world superstar.
Mayuri would see it and say that he has gone a long way.
I almost saw it.
It would be even better if Okarin cosplayed.
I'll think about it.
Really?
But in return, you will also cosplay.
Exactly.
We'll call Ryukaku and Kristina.
And you can convince them to cosplay with us.
If you agree, then I, this crazy scientist and chemist,
will arrange a cosplay debut in Kome.
I see.
It won't be easy.
But Kurisu is interested.
So Mayuri will try to do everything for the next Kome.
And then...
What?
My watch stopped.
That's strange.
I recently...
Okarin!
No!
I can't see it anymore!
I'm so close!
Okarin!
Stay here!
Okarin!
I'm going to change the fate.
I will forbid it!
If I allow this machine to beat me down!
If I lie here!
Something will necessarily change!
Something!
Okarin!
Mayuri!
Mayuri!
Okarin!
I was useful to you!
Mayuri!
Mayusha!
In the end, you were useful to me!
Okarin!
Mayuri!
Hey, Mayuri!
You can't see the stars from here, can you?
I can't see the stars.
It's not fair!
I'm sorry.
I want to talk to you, Kurisu.
I'm going to start the game!
Okabe?
Okabe?
How long are you going to stay here?
I thought I asked you not to bother me.
You asked, but you hang here on the roof for hours in complete silence.
I'm worried.
Well, not that I'm worried, but ...
Tell me, why did you cancel the break-in?
I already told you.
You thought I was scared of the FBI, right?
I remember!
I prefer to think like a law-abiding citizen.
It doesn't look like you.
Okabe, what happened to your normal, soulless state?
Great, mad scientist, chemist!
How can I be like that now?
Mad scientist?
Chemist?
It's all nonsense!
I came up with all this!
Didn't you know?
I realized it five minutes after our meeting.
Did you make a jump again?
What happened?
I've been helping you with everything for a long time, haven't I?
Don't hold it all in yourself!
We've come so far just because we thought it all together, haven't we?
We've come so far?
Suzuka and Ferris.
Ryukaka.
In order to move forward like this, I sacrificed what they loved most.
And now it's all going to end like this?
What do you mean?
Why?
Okabe!
Hey, Okabe.
You cried recently.
Even Hashi was worried.
He thought you had a terrible dream.
Tell me.
Okabe, I want to help you!
July 28th.
Mayuri and I came to Dr. Nakabachi's press conference.
There...
There I saw Kurisu Makisa cut by someone.
But I don't know who.
I sent a message to Daru's phone, which was connected to the microwave.
The first D-mail.
The message that took us from the Beta Line of Worlds to the Alpha Line.
The removal of this message from the CERN base and the return to the Beta Line of Worlds
means the return to that world.
If we return to the Beta Line of Worlds, if we cancel the first D-mail, you will die.
Mayuri.
Answer the call.
Answer.
Mayuri?
Yes.
What happened?
Listen, Daru told me that you were behaving strangely.
It's nothing serious.
Daru thought so.
But...
I'm sorry.
I was so busy at the commemoration that I couldn't spend time with you.
Hey, you could tell me everything, remember?
The organization had four generals.
Gepu, Sudachi, Seiyu and Jaka.
Genbu, Suzaku, Seiryu and Byako.
Oh, right, right.
I really like listening to stories about all this.
Are you there?
If Mayusha becomes a abuser, tell me, okay?
And now I have to go.
If I can do something, call me immediately.
Mayuri.
You have to go right now.
According to your answer, I understood what Mayuri told you.
You have to go to her.
You won't be able to find a way out, even if you stay and talk to me.
That's why you were sitting here alone, right?
Then you have to go to Mayuri.
The only thing you can achieve by staying here is hurting my pride.
I'm going.
It's Mayusha. I can't answer you right now.
It's me.
One of the cosplayers said that Mayusha recently left.
I see.
I'm sorry.
You came to me because of Bono, right, granny?
And I've been having terrible dreams lately.
In these dreams, terrible things happen to me.
They shoot me with a gun, knock down cars and move trains.
They are so bright as if this is actually happening.
It was scary and painful.
And so sad.
I tried to call for help with all my might.
But I couldn't.
Why do I have such dreams?
But at the end of every dream, Akarin always comes to save me.
Mayusha says, thank you, Akarin.
But he doesn't hear her.
He hugs Mayusha and looks sad.
And he never cries, but he clearly can't hold back.
Then Mayusha says, I'm sorry, but he doesn't hear again.
And then I wake up.
I'm sorry. I'm telling you all sorts of nonsense.
And we have a lot of new labyrinths.
Kurisu, Moeko, Ryuko and Ferris.
And Suzu.
And at first there were only two of us.
Kurisu is very smart.
And she discusses incredibly complicated things with Akarin.
It's so fun.
Akarin is happy that he can discuss so much.
But you know, sometimes I remember.
My very first visit to the laboratory.
It was the beginning of spring, but it was snowing.
When I came to the laboratory after school, Akarin was not there.
But while I was tidying up, he came back.
Then I said, welcome back.
But he didn't answer, I came back.
He said, good job.
And then every day after school I went there for about two hours.
We talked all this time.
It was so great.
We were just together.
Time went by slowly, it was wonderful.
Mayusha felt like a real hostage.
Did something good happen?
Nothing good happened, but still good.
I see, you saw some kind of mirage.
It may be an illusion of the leader of the Illusion Organization.
I see, then I'll be more careful.
But I'm ready to argue with this leader of the Illusion Organization.
I don't think he's that bad.
Then I didn't spend so much time talking to Akarin.
Earlier, looking at him, I could say what he was thinking about.
But now I can't.
Except for cases when he suffers.
When he looks like he's going to cry.
Then I know he's thinking about me.
I don't want to be his abuser.
I'm sorry, I'm telling you something sad again.
Maybe I've been lonely lately.
Grandma, you can't go on like this.
Maybe.
Akarin!
How did you know I was here?
I always know where my hostage is.
So you can't run away from me.
And don't try to.
You shouldn't overdo it.
I'm not that weak, so you shouldn't worry about it.
When the time comes, I'll tell you everything.
Okay.
Let's go home.
Only first.
I know.
You want to get another oppo, right?
