        <pre>Ryou Kaka, please, don't worry and listen to me. You were a guy.
You're doing your own thing again. Wait, don't cry. Let me finish.
It's all for Yuri. I need you to become a guy again.

What's wrong?
You look like you prepared yakisoba and dropped it in the sink.
I would say that I look like I wanted to use cards for a discount, but I saw that they were all expired.
Perhaps you are not so depressed, you can still joke.
Okarin, Mayushii is very disappointed in you.
What are you talking about?
Don't try to say anything.
You made Ryou cry, can you say no?
How did you know?
When I called her to the lab, she just started crying.
And when I asked why, she said you called her a guy.
Did you hear about Dimei?
Dimei?
I told you not to try to say anything. You have to apologize to her.
Okabe!
Did you say something terrible about Urushibara-san?
No, it's not what it seems. It's all for...
What do you mean?
For me, assistant!
Get out!
What is it?
So the next Dimei that needs to be canceled is the one that Ryoukaku sent his mother to Pager before his birth.
Urushibara-san was really a guy?
Unbelievable.
But it's true.
It was the truth.
He was a guy.
He was like Hashida?
What a horror.
No, he looked exactly the same as he is now.
Then it's ok.
Anyway, to save Mayuri, I have to return Ryoukaku to the guy.
But you know what exactly she sent in her Dimei, don't you?
So you didn't have to talk to her.
You could just do it yourself.
I don't know Pager's mother's number.
Besides, I thought it would be better for her if I tell the truth without trying to lie.
Do you think it's better to make her cry?
It's just your usual stuff, isn't it?
It's just a joke.
How cruel.
I never thought you could say that to me.
So, is that a flag?
Flag?
I never said anything like that.
One day this fight will end and I'll get married.
It's a dead flag.
I'm talking about a love flag.
Love flag?
Yes.
Her beloved Akabe said that she is actually a guy.
And it broke her heart.
But Ryoukaku is a guy?
It was on the previous line, wasn't it?
I have to say something important.
Come to the temple.
Akabe-san, I'm sorry for all this.
No, you're the one who's sorry I cried.
So?
You wanted to tell me something important?
Yes.
I have a request.
A request?
I believe in what you told me.
So...
I'll be a new guy, but instead...
Please be my boyfriend.
Boyfriend?
Why should I be your boyfriend?
Because I love you.
Because I love you, Akabe-san.
So tomorrow, just for one day...
Will you be my boyfriend?
But you're...
But...
Okay, I agree, don't cry.
Okay, I'll be your boyfriend if you really want it.
Really?
Why are you crying?
Because I'm happy.
She's really cute.
So you're meeting up with Roushibara-san tomorrow?
Yes.
Meeting up with a mad scientist from a senior high school?
Don't say that.
She's killing me.
She's asking for advice on dating.
I told you, I'm not your assistant.
You're going on a date with someone.
Your order.
Two coffees with ice, meow.
Are you meeting up with Mayusha?
Or with this one?
No, she's just an assistant.
Even if it's to improve your skills, you're going after too many girls, meow.
Too many girls, huh?
Don't say such things to people who can't understand them!
Listen, and you...
What are you doing to improve your skills?
I wanted to tell you what Chimera Rakovoid is doing.
What are you talking about?
I don't understand.
It's just curious.
I'm just wondering, why do you use technology if you already have a favorite person?
There's no point in that.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Anyway, if there's someone you'd like to be with, why don't you go on a date with her?
I already told you I wasn't going to.
Okarin!
I'd be happy if you'd take me to Italy.
If you want to know what to do on a date, I've kissed a lot of girls.
And I can tell you everything you need to know.
Nene-chan, Shinoko-chan, Hanoko-chan, Rinko-chan...
They're all girls from the game.
I have a real date.
I heard they go to Aoyama or Motesando or Nishiazabu.
Fashionable and fashionable.
A beautiful night.
A special dinner.
It's hopeless.
It's just a parallel world.
It has nothing to do with our reality.
What can you achieve?
I, Chimera Rakovoid, was born with IQ 170.
The same as Isaka Newton.
I'm an insane scientist.
That's why I'm more interested in research, not girls.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
What are you talking about?
You have more experience on dates.
Why are you talking so lowly?
You were so busy with your studies and research that you never went on a date.
So you have a lonely youth, right?
Shut up!
Would it be bad to be a virgin?
The most important thing on a first date is to be attractive to your partner.
Part of the clothes are not necessarily expensive clothes.
But it must be clean.
I understand.
There's nothing cleaner than a lab coat.
Who goes on dates like that?
It also concerns the place where you go.
You don't have to go to some expensive restaurant.
Where is the place you usually go to?
We usually go.
So there are no problems with the establishment.
Of course.
On the contrary, you can't bring her to such a dull place as this.
I understand.
The other place I go to is May Queen.
The first date on May Queen?
Weapons store.
Why do you need a weapon?
You just read books on dates.
So stop talking all day.
American virgin.
Who is American virgin?
You.
Who else?
You are also a virgin.
Hey, maybe you can read this book?
This is the guidebook for hinting games.
So what?
Horrible things sometimes happen on dates.
Well, like holding hands.
Or when she takes your hands and presses your game.
Hey, damn it.
And at the very end of the date, a kiss.
Damn it.
So that you all fall asleep.
So, it's morning, and I don't have a plan.
Brother Inetie, come on, get dressed.
Take off the labels.
But who ties the tie like that?
Get the hell out of here, who are you?
Done.
It feels like someone has pulled a bandage around the neck.
Here, don't forget the bandage.
You know what that means.
I'm still waiting for you.
That's the sign.
It's about the yellow
Where did you get this?
It's already outdated anyway.
You knew that?
So what?
The right answer?
You'll turn it around before she sits on the bench.
It doesn't matter.
I'll be next to you.
If you need anything, I'll tell you.
Are you coming with me?
As they say.
Operation Valkyria has begun.
Why is it Scandinavian mythology?
It is very important not to be late.
Come at least 15 minutes earlier.
Okabe-san!
I'm sorry.
I thought it was too early.
Have you been waiting for me for a long time?
No, I just got here.
Thank God.
Well, shall we go?
Yes.
I've never seen you without a coat before.
Well, this is a date.
When you walk with a girl, you need to take the opposite lane unnoticed.
Is something wrong?
No, everything is fine.
Wow, look what's there.
Unnoticeable like an elephant.
And if a car or motorcycle approaches, unnoticeably protect her.
He saved her?
Okabe-san!
Are you all right?
Well, here he is.
The maid helped him get up.
And then she gave him a business card.
What does he think?
Miss Maki seems to be upset.
The weather is good today, isn't it?
Yes.
Just a little cloudy.
Yes, that's right.
This cake is very tasty.
And coffee too.
Why?
I've always talked to her normally.
But now, when you're on a date, what a beautiful restaurant.
Do you often come here?
No.
That's a problem.
The current conversation is smooth.
The current conversation is smooth.
An important detail.
In fact, I'm here for the first time.
He answered her question before.
Today is August 14, the day of the patent.
This is the date when the first patent was registered in Japan.
I found something to tell you.
You know so much about Okabe-san.
Well, perhaps.
Let's go home, Maki-se.
Anyway, we're just watching, and we can't help you.
No, we'll watch it to the end.
Thank you very much.
It's boring.
Go out with me on a date.
Stupid, why did you take it?
Now let's go for a walk around the city.
Follow me.
Follow me.
Follow me.
Ryouko-chan?
It's hot.
It's hot.
They went back and forth to the UN.
They went back and forth to the UN.
Okabe-san.
Okabe-san.
Do you remember our first meeting?
Do you remember our first meeting?
Do you remember our first meeting?
I remember.
I remember.
I remember.
Do you remember our first meeting?
Do you remember our first meeting?
Yes.
You saved me when someone approached me with a camera.
You saved me when someone approached me with a camera.
You saved me when someone approached me with a camera.
I remember.
Thank you very much.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Why are you apologizing?
Because I'm...
Even though I look like that, but I'm a guy.
What's the matter with you? Are you a guy or a girl?
It doesn't matter.
At that moment, your words made me happy.
It was these words that made me fall in love with you.
It doesn't matter, does it?
Oh, no, wait a minute, isn't that a memory of you as a guy?
What did I say? I feel strange.
Everything is the same as Spiris.
She remembered the past line of the world.
Kyoma, thank you for today.
I was so happy, so happy.
So happy that you were my boyfriend.
Hey, here's the pager number of my mom.
Meat, meat, vegetables, vegetables, meat, meat, vegetables, vegetables.
When she gets this, I'm sure Urushibara-san's mom will think that the previous message was just a prank.
We are ready.
What's the matter, Akabe?
Tettou, listen, listen.
Mayusha saw Ayuku-chan on a date with someone.
It was Karin.
Come on, lie to you.
It was definitely not him.
He was dressed in ordinary clothes and looked like a gentleman.
She's right. It wasn't me.
It was a date with me.
And Karin?
The date is not over yet.
But Akabe-san, Kyoma, you forgot my name, Ryukaka.
Guys, girls, boyfriends.
The only one who was confused was me.
It doesn't matter.
I finally understood.
I am me, and you are you.
My student.
Exactly.
Then bring me the dark blade, Samidar.
Like this.
Let's do it again.
Yes.
Listen, Ryukaka, listen carefully.
The legend about this dark blade takes us back to the time of Shutsuna.
One night, full of bloody red moons, the traveler fell off the road.
Look how he's going.
Great. He made up with Ryuka.
Looks like he doesn't need us anymore.
Please, thank you, Yuri.
Please, help me.
The old computer you're looking for.
The IBM 500?
It was in our warehouse until last New Year.
But I broke it.
When I was cleaning the warehouse.
It's all my fault.
Akabe-san, please.
Thank you, Yuri.
It's been a long time.
Akabe-san, I'm so glad I was able to train with you.
Please leave.
If you don't leave, I'm afraid I'll cry again.
I have to say the password, don't I?
L, Psi, Kongri.
Kongru.
L, Psi.
I really don't want to come back.
Because...
Because if everything comes back, I'll have to suppress the feelings I have for you forever.
I can't love you when I become a guy.
Koryu Kaka.
If I become a guy again, I'll forget everything about today.
That we had a date, that we trained together.
That I hugged you like this.
But if I have to suffer like now, then I should never wish to become a girl.
Even if you become a guy again.
For me, you will still be Koryu Kaka.
Nothing will change.
Right.
It doesn't matter if I become a guy or a girl.
It doesn't matter, right?
But just a little bit more.
Please remember me.
Remember that I was a girl.
I will never forget.
Is something wrong, Koryu-san?
Kourushibara Ryuko.
With female manners and voice.
No, more feminine than any woman.
Tell me, Ryuko Kaka.
Yes?
Do you like me?
What did you say?
Do you like me?
I respect you.
But...
He's a guy.
He's a girl.
There is one last message.
One more.
