Kouma, I want you to become a messiah.
You want me to become a messiah?
Funny, I'm a crazy scientist, thirsting for chaos and destruction.
What's wrong with him?
It's time to resume the operation, Urs.
What? You're still down there?
Don't worry, wait, I'll tell you right away.
I'm against it.
Against what?
Wasn't it you who helped me this morning?
This morning?
Well, yes.
Ah, the experiment has already been carried out.
The D-Mail has changed the past.
Really?
The reality has changed?
Undoubtedly, as a result, the honor of your memories has changed.
Are you talking about Ryo Watanabe?
Exactly.
So, why are you the only one who keeps the memories?
Titor told me that I have the power.
In order to check this, we need to repeat the experiment.
Power?
The power to preserve memories, regardless of the change of reality.
The magic eye of Steiner's reading.
Steiner's brother.
The power to preserve memories, regardless of the change of reality.
The power to preserve memories, regardless of the change of reality.

Dardaru!
The entrances are empty.
Well, there is a letter that arrived five days ago and proof of the change of reality.
You could only remember this?
We sent D-Mail to Dardaru five days ago, in which they indicated the combination of cards for the victory at the Fairies Cup.
Manlyushka!
I have a question for you.
Did you lose the Fairies Cup last week?
What? Did I lose almost immediately?
Oh, I see. Thank you. Bye.
Did Dardaru's letter change the past?
We can't achieve success with such a tempo.
It was just not enough.
We have to come up with a simple way to check if the past has changed.
You just don't think that I agree with these experiments.
Okay, you have an idea.
Why are you the only one who remembers everything?
I told you, this is the power of the magic eye, the reading of Steiner.
To make sure of this, I'll let you send the next D-Mail.
Thank you.
Are you afraid of the paradox of time?
I just don't see the point.
I'm already 18, and I don't want to change anything.
Even my mistakes are part of my life.
But you like to experiment, don't you?
That's right.
What's wrong with that?
You're just going to sit and watch while others risk it.
You're a real mad scientist.
Enough!
But seriously...
Maeko, please, I also want to send a D-Mail.
But seriously, if we want to improve the D-Mail,
please, Maeko, please.
We need to carry out experiments.
I'm also an employee of the laboratory, Maeko.
Is that Kira?
Enough already!
Can't you?
Damn, she got us in trouble.
Finally, we made it.
And those pancakes were not bad.
Yeah.
Hey, don't make a mistake here.
I'm waiting for someone.
Stop scaring Naio.
I didn't do anything like that.
Let's go, Naio.
Let's leave this loser to fry alone.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Mayuri's sister.
Here, take this.
Oh, thank you.
And this is for Karina.
Hello.
Good morning, Suzu.
She's an assistant.
Hey, hey.
Hey, hey, what happened next?
What is this about?
About the time machine.
Did you ask John Titor?
Yes, but I didn't quite understand his answer.
What exactly?
Why are you so interested in it?
Girl, are you a fan of Titor?
No.
Kurisu.
Good morning.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh, I can see the differences between you two.
What is it?
They don't like my quarrels.
Don't worry, everything is fine.
Thank you.
No personal messages.
Come up with a message to check if the future has changed.
Four days ago I bought a new mobile phone, but I want to write that I didn't do it.
I see.
If the past changes, Kiryu-chan will have a different phone.
It's simple.
Well, then, let's get started.
Let's get started!
Let's go.
Activate the game with a new phone.
Don't forget to...
You're so big.
What is this?
I made a mistake with the numbers, I lied.
Please accept my apologies.
That's my apology.
I see.
That's...
I'm sorry.
You're so selfish.
Thank you.
If you don't mind, I'm leaving.
You seem to be busy.
Goodbye.
Try on my clothes next time, okay?
I'm sorry.
I'm...
You don't want to?
You'd better go.
Well, goodbye.
Bye-bye.
What a culture.
It's the same feeling again.
That means...
The reality has changed.
What's going on?
What?
What are you talking about?
I'm sorry.
What are you talking about?
Didn't Ryukako come?
Ryukako?
No.
She didn't come.
Where's Moeka?
Where's Moeka?
Moeka?
Who's that?
Kiryu Moeka?
She didn't come today?
What's going on?
Who's that?
Kiryu Moeka?
I've never heard of her.
What?
D-mail again?
What's going on?
The reality has changed.
The existence of Moeka has been erased.
It can't be.
There's a message in the diary.
Until July 31st.
Moeka's email is still there.
Something's wrong.
I'm sorry, I'm very busy.
I'll text you later.
In other words, the reality has changed so that
Kiryu Moeka received the letter four days ago?
Kiryu Moeka didn't go to the lab because her behavior was bad?
And she didn't come to the lab?
It seems so.
And again, only you remember everything.
Steiner Steiner, don't you?
By the way, it's pretty embarrassing to say this.
I think you should stop.
I don't care about your opinion.
I don't need it.
The power to preserve memories
regardless of the change of reality.
Is that so?
And here I am.
Let's talk about it tomorrow.
See you tomorrow, Akarin.
I really have this ability.
And that means
that I
Well, I
I wonder how they can sleep in the lab.
He says that any crazy scientist does this.
That's right, let's sleep there next time too.
Only if there are no perverts there.
Listen, can you come to my hotel?
Can I?
Of course.
Okay, then wait for me.
Ruka, are you shy?
Yes, yes.
What?
Really?
What?
You didn't bring your magic sword, did you?
Well, I'll get away from him, Akarin.
Today he came to me.
He's going to try on my clothes.
But I
Let's go.
Bye, Ruka, bye.
This is mine.
Take off your clothes.
Don't touch me there.
Okay, I'll put it on myself.
Stay away from me.
You can't handle it yourself.
Please don't undress me.
Great, Yuri girls.
He's a guy.
Ruka is a guy.
So even better.
This is Kirari from Rainet.
I thought you were so cute, Ruka.
It's embarrassing.
Come on.
Being cute is not a crime.
I want to take a picture of them.
What do you say, Akarin?
Exactly.
This is me.
I just became a victim of a psycho.
This is awful.
My soul is burning.
What's wrong, Kouma?
What's going on with him?
Kurisu.
You pervert.
Don't look at me like you're sleeping.
I'm not a pervert.
Come on.
You're a pervert.
You're a pervert.
Come on.
How do you like this cosplay?
It looks good, doesn't it?
Yes, it's very cute.
Cute?
Then let's try on others.
Wait.
I came because I have a request.
Didn't you come to cosplay?
I said no.
But you didn't listen to me.
I'm sorry.
I was too involved.
What did you want to ask?
Actually...
I would like to send a letter to my past.
What?
Yesterday...
I came to apologize for the game in Ryoloto, but...
Then...
D-mail again?
What are you talking about?
The reality has changed.
The existence of Maeki has been erased.
It can't be.
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have listened to you.
I didn't want to.
Ryoko, what do you want to send to the past?
Actually...
I...
I want to be a girl.
What?
I don't like the way I look.
I think I'd better be a girl.
I've been thinking about it for a long time.
Wait a minute.
What is she talking about?
It looks like you made a fatal mistake.
Mistake?
Ryoko is not a girl.
He is a guy.
What a joke.
You don't believe me.
If you call yourself a scientist, check it yourself.
Such a cutie can't be a guy.
I'm sorry.
Are you okay?
I'm serious.
I really want to be a girl.
Please.
I'm not sure if you can change your gender by sending a D-mail.
I heard that if there is a lot of meat during pregnancy, a boy is born.
And if there are a lot of vegetables, a girl is born.
Do you want us to send your mother a D-mail with an offer to eat more vegetables?
Is it possible?
Okay.
Here is your wish.
Thank you.
Congratulations, Ryuko.
Don't you think it's a stupid idea?
Do you think you can achieve this by eating more vegetables?
Right.
There is no scientific confirmation for this.
He is really worried about this.
So it will be easier for him.
Ryukako, from this moment on, you will become the sixth member of the laboratory of fantastic devices.
Let's start the experiment.
Wait.
Are you 17 this year?
Yes.
So you were born in 1993.
What happened?
When mobile phones became popular in Japan?
When was it?
Somewhere in 1996.
And then mobile mail appeared later.
That is, when he was born, his mother probably did not have a
Here it is.
I'm afraid of my genius.
Not again.
If she doesn't have a cell phone, then we'll send her to Pager.
Pagers.
Devices capable of receiving short messages via electromagnetic waves.
In the 90s, they were extremely popular, but the appearance of cell phones made them popular.
Pagers.
I've never seen them.
You know a lot.
Maybe I should call you Pager.
It was written here.
Why didn't you read it yourself?
Member number 006.
Here is your first task.
Find out where your mother had Pager.
And find out his number.
Yes.
My mother had it.
This is the number.
Did you do it?
Did you come up with what to write?
Yes.
It's good for the child to be healthy.
I heard that you can only send 18 symbols.
You can only send Latin letters to Pager.
It must be translated.
Wait a second.
You need two symbols to call the letters.
What?
You can send 36 numbers.
Do you have 40?
Then.
Try this.
Let's start.
Are you sure?
Yes.
Are you sure?
Of course.
I'm sure.
My shadow was activated.
That means...
I see.
Some people wear this.
Yes, it's cute.
Ruka, you'd like to have this.
Do you think so?
This is...
Hey, pervert!
What are you looking at?
No, I'm...
Wait
It will be difficult to ask Ryuko about his field
Nevertheless
It seems to have come out
What perverted thoughts are spinning in your head?
Oh my god, Karin
I can't take my eyes off these two perverts for a minute
Pervert, I'm just a little worried
What's the difference?
It doesn't change the essence of the problem
But
The reality has changed again
Something happened
But what?
Well
