The parents of the cat died on a mission two years ago, protecting the city from the villain.
For a hero, this is an honorable death.
But...
Dad! Mom!
But can you explain all this to the little child?
The parents left him.
But society, instead of mourning, praised their actions.
The cat could not understand all this. It was disgusting to him.

But you know what, cat?
I'm sure one day you'll meet a worthy person.
And then you'll understand.
The one who, without any thought, risks his life for you.
The one who will...
There are no such people.
Why?
Where are the villains from?
Where are the villains from?
Pixie Bob!
Don't.
Cat!
Five minutes earlier
Oh, we also want to play the test of courage.
Why are you bringing us up?
Where's our gingerbread?
Even if it's not gingerbread, it's a carrot.
Then give us at least its teacher.
Don't put carrots in here.
In these lessons, I will teach you how to survive in dangerous situations.
If you do not realize your weaknesses, you will lag behind the rest even more.
You can call gingerbread what you eventually achieve.
But gingerbread is delicious.
Wow, just look!
Five idiots from Class A fell.
While from Class B only one me.
Are you okay with your head?
Every time the same.
I wonder what's going on in his head.
Vlad, I would like to do physical exercises today.
Well, to tell the truth, I thought about it myself.
Listen, everyone!
Is the telepathy right?
I like it and it tickles pleasantly.
I don't know what to answer you so as not to accidentally offend.
Shut up.
Two villains attacked us, but I think there are much more of them.
Everyone who can immediately go to the building.
And in no case do not engage with them in battle.
Vlad, stay here.
I will help the rest of the students.
How could this happen?
Everything is very bad.
You'd better worry about yourself.
Wipe your head.
Vlad!
Do not get confused under your feet, professional.
We have nothing to do with you.
How do you rest here, huh, kids from U.A.?
We are the strike squad of the League of Villains.
The League of Villains?
What do they need here?
I'm thinking about breaking the turtle of this lady.
Hey, what do you think?
Who will allow you?
Wait, Mac, don't rush.
You too, Tiger, calm down.
According to the ideology of the spot, the hero must deserve the right to be called a hero or die.
Spot?
Do you also adhere to his ideology?
Yes, I do.
And, by the way, everything has already been decided with you, Ockarik.
You are one of those who stopped the justice of Pitnafkosu.
I apologize for my manners.
My name is Spina.
And I will turn his dreams into reality.
Enough of this nonsense, bastards.
A woman lying on the ground has long dreamed of getting married.
And she tried her best for this.
How dare you beat her in the face and at the same time laugh at her body?
Then let her not dare to call herself a hero.
Tiger, I gave orders.
We will leave the rescue of the students to Rockdoll.
And we will keep the defense here.
The rest, run and do not fight them.
They are on a completely different level.
We understand you.
Go ahead.
Midoriya!
Go without me.
What are you talking about?
I know where he is.
I know!
Kendo!
Tetsu-Tetsu!
Ibarra!
Where did you get these masks?
I made them from class A.
And you will take her to the rest from class B to help.
Take it. She made a lot of them.
Thank you.
We need to get back to the building quickly.
It's dangerous to move around like this.
We don't know where the villains are and how many of them.
No, I will fight.
And you watch over Shiozaki and Kodai.
We were told not to fight.
You always reproach the Monomu for these words.
But don't you feel it yourself?
The difference between us and class A.
I feel it for sure.
I feel it for sure.
From the very exam of U.A.
We studied on the same program.
So what's our difference?
It's obvious.
They had a turning point.
This moment created their progress.
And it's normal.
What kind of hero will turn his back?
While causing harm to others.
Tetsu-Tetsu!
Don't stop me, Kendo.
If we don't do something now in class B,
then when?
I will find the villains.
And I will kill them all.
Koto!
Koto!
Do you hear me?
Come back to the building!
I'm sorry.
I don't know where you are.
I'm sorry, Koto.
I can't help you.
Run away if you can.
I wanted to find a good look at all this.
Hey.
You have an interesting cap, boy.
Let's switch to this stupid mask, huh?
I'm new to them.
They said there was no time to make a normal mask.
Hey, hey!
I guess I'll break off on you.
Come on!
Seahorses.
What a great duet they were.
But their wonderful lives
were torn apart by the hands of the villain.
The villain is on the run.
The police are chasing him.
You!
His charm is a type of reinforcement
and is a great danger.
Contact the police if you see this face.
The only difference is that
on his left eye
sea conches left a scar.
Dad!
Mom!
What for?
Oh, you were on the list too.
I wanted to avoid
contact with the villain.
But unfortunately he's already here.
Damn.
And my phone broke.
I came here without telling the others.
And this time I have nowhere to wait for help.
There's only me here.
Only me alone.
Alone with the villain.
At the same time, you still need to protect the cat.
Don't you dare.
Don't even think about running away.
Apparently I have no other choice.
That's it.
Everything will be fine, cat.
I'll save you.
At any cost.
Sounded with the support of the Gym Club.
The site of the group is in VK.com.
Damn.
I saw one of the villains.
I'm worried about the others, but we have no choice.
We need to go back to the building,
bypass the destination points.
Let's leave it to Ragdoll's conscience.
Don't you dare!
Who is it?
It's...
Hey!
Who walked in front of us?
Takayami
and Shoji.
Wonderful.
I need to work.
I got too carried away.
What a lovely flesh.
Stop seducing me.
It's time for me to work.
You say not to fight them?
High-level heroes
or a pathetic parody?
And you deserve our punishment.
Spinner.
What kind of a man are you?
It's not my dream.
What?
Why are you blushing?
You're innocent.
Damn your tricks.
Come here, kitty.
You won't get away with this trick twice.
Hikishi Kenji
The villain's name is Magno.
9 robberies, 3 murders,
29 attempts at murder.
Oh, I'm so famous.
What have you forgotten, criminal?
Tiger, I don't understand.
Ragdoll doesn't answer the request.
Usually she does it right away.
Really?
Interesting.
Why is that?
You'll save him at any cost, right?
I didn't expect to hear
anything else from a teenage hero.
They talk about justice
without understanding what it is.
So your name is Midoriya?
Great.
You've been ordered to kill
at the first opportunity.
Now I'm definitely going to break away.
Let's see what kind of blood you have.
He's attacking.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I almost forgot.
Tell me.
Where is Bakuga?
Kachan?
I need it for work.
They need Kachan?
Why?
I don't know how to accept it.
Right?
Then...
Let's play!
Here's the blood.
That's what I wanted.
What did you say?
You'll save him at any cost?
Then why are you running away?
You're weird.
This is too strong.
Too fast.
You can't think about Kachan now.
You need to concentrate.
Concentrate on the enemy in front of me.
Destroyer!
What?
Is this your trick?
I have enough speed,
but not enough strength.
My trick allows me to build muscles.
I build them on top of the skin.
And it gives me more strength and speed.
And it protects the skin.
What do I want to say?
I'm bragging.
In other words, you are
a weaker version of me.
Do you understand what I feel?
I can't stop laughing.
You wanted to save him?
How exactly?
If you can't do anything,
then you're just an empty bell.
Be honest with yourself.
Sea horses.
Dad.
Mom.
Did you torture them like he did now
before you killed him?
What?
Really?
So you're the son of these heroes?
It's just destiny.
Sea horses.
Because of them,
I needed an artificial eye.
It's all because of you.
It's all because of people like you.
It's happening again and again because of you.
Today's kids
love to make a fuss.
That's not going to work.
I didn't kill them
because they did with my eye.
I just wanted to kill them.
And these two
got in my way.
And here's the result of the conflict
of our interests.
It's not my fault
that they didn't have enough strength to stop me.
Your favorite daddy
and mommy.
I knew you'd wake up.
You bastard.
You're the only one to blame for this.
If you do this,
then speed doesn't matter.
So what now?
Are you going to beat me up with your weak hand?
I don't care if I can do it or not.
This is the work of a hero.
Put your life on the line.
What?
One for all.
100% coverage.
Stronger than before.
Destroyer!
I'm sorry.
You got hurt too.
Save me.
Why?
It's time to go back.
It's dangerous here.
It can't be.
How did you get here?
I don't know.
It can't be.
How?
I used 100% of my strength.
It was all the power of the Almighty.
What a blow.
You're not that bad, Midoriya.
Stop!
I won't. I'm coming for you.
What do I do?
Think.
I don't have time to think.
What do you want?
What do the villains need from us?
I don't care at all.
I just came to have fun.
They promised me that I could do what I wanted.
So I agreed.
Did you forget?
I said I just wanted to play.
When did I say let's play?
Right?
Well, now no.
And the game is over.
You turned out to be stronger than I thought.
Does that mean I have to be serious?
Kota, grab me!
Now he's stronger than before.
Stronger and faster.
He really just played.
He loves to play by killing people.
Damn, I'm too nervous.
If we get to the camp,
Izao's teacher will help.
He'll wipe out his premonition.
Don't be afraid.
Can I run away from him and get to the camp?
No, it's impossible.
I'm too tired from training.
Don't think.
If I show him my back,
he'll just kill me.
There's no choice but to fight and win.
You have no other choice, Midoriya Izu.
You promised to save him.
Remember why you're here.
Get away, Kota.
If my hit goes through...
Run to the camp, Izao.
If it goes through...
Just don't tell me you...
It won't work, just run!
Your hit didn't work, did you forget?
And your arm is broken.
It's all right.
One for all.
100% cover.
Midoriya!
Detroit...
Destroyer!
What's going on?
It's weaker than last time.
It's all right.
It's just fine.
I won't let him take another step.
Now run!
Just run!
Well, kid.
You're just the best!
Shut up!
Why?
Show me your blood!
The hero breaks all obstacles on his way.
I'm sorry, Mom.
I'm sorry.
All-powerful.
All-powerful!
All...
You're done!
What? Water?
Water?
What? Water?
I...
Stop it!
Koto...
Oh, you wait, okay.
I'll deal with you later.
I should have distracted myself.
As if...
I'll let you!
Wait, how did you get stronger?
I won't let you kill him!
One for all.
One million percent!
Delaver!
Detroit!
Destroyer!
No!
Why?
Koto...
The sea horses, your mom and dad...
It's true that they left you.
But at the same time, they saved a lot of lives.
You don't owe me anything!
I'm sure you'll meet a worthy person one day.
And then you'll understand.
You don't know anything about me!
Why are you helping me?
The one who risked his life for you without a thought.
The one who can be called...
...my...
...my hero!
Let's hear it again.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry.
And this is the preview!
I could defeat Muscle M친 and rescue Koto!
But the villains continue to attack the others.
In the next episode, save them! Iron fist! Plus Ultra!
