        <pre>The prestigious educational institution in which young heroes are taught is the U.A. Academy.
To resist the difficulties and save people with a smile.
To become the greatest of the heroes!
To become the greatest of heroes!
To become the greatest of heroes!
To become the greatest of heroes!
Show me your blood!
The heroes will break all obstacles on their way!
I'm sorry, mom! I'm sorry!
All-powerful! All-powerful! All...
You're done!
What? Water?
Stop it!
Kota...
You wait there, okay? I'll deal with you later.
You shouldn't get distracted.
As if... I'll let you!
Oh, wait, how did you get stronger?
You'll kill him!
One for all!
One million percent!
Delaver!
Detroit!
Destroyer!
All-powerful! All-powerful! All...
Destroyer!
Save them, Iron Fist!
Do you think they can handle this mission?
Yeah, it's too early for me to go out.
The rules have changed completely.
In other words, the game has become completely different.
Before that, we played RPG.
We had the best equipment, and we went to the final boss on the first level.
But we had to play the strategy.
I have to be a player and use my pawns correctly.
To break the enemy's high-level defense.
The results of the first strike group will not matter.
I don't care if these guys can handle it or not.
The point is to make the heroes afraid.
So you brought them to the victim?
Don't be so funny.
Am I a heartless bastard?
These guys are strong.
Let them have different goals.
But these are the guys we can rely on.
Not only do they humiliate us.
The law of society and their laws.
I really hope for success.
Hey!
Everything's fine.
I still have a lot to do.
What are you doing?
You're barely standing.
I thought he wouldn't defend himself.
But I still gave all my strength for the attack.
I thought I could cause him serious damage.
But he turned out to be stronger than I thought.
Much stronger.
If all the coming villains are at the same level,
then the guys are in danger.
Besides, their goal was the students.
I have to tell this to the teacher Aizawa and the cat team.
If I can save them,
then I just have to save them, you know?
For now, we can leave the villain here.
Even though I beat him with my already broken hand.
He should have gotten it specifically.
It's unlikely he'll wake up soon.
And even if he wakes up, I don't think he'll be able to walk.
Now my task is to protect you.
What?
There's a thing that only you can do.
They set a fire in the forest.
If we don't put out the fire, we won't be saved.
You know what I mean, don't you?
We need your magic.
Maybe I saved you.
Just like before.
But now it's your turn to save.
And now jump on your back.
We're going to the camp.
Can you move with such fractures?
Everything is fine.
My legs are still intact.
Forward!
Hold on tight!
Where's the boy named Bakugo?
I don't like it all.
A few minutes ago.
Vlad, protect the children.
I'm leaving this place to you.
I don't even want to think about the consequences.
Everything is very bad.
You'd better worry about yourself.
Wipe your head.
Well, it's not in vain that they call you Profi.
There will be no second time.
What do you want?
And how many of you are here?
Tell me.
What for?
Let's say this one.
The next one will be the right hand.
Do you feel the sequence?
It will be a pity for the legs.
I'll have to drag you on my hands.
Are you in a hurry?
Wipe your head.
What the...
Teacher!
You...
My body is already at its limit.
But at least you're not the worst teacher.
Right, hero?
Are your students important to you?
Isn't his miracle fire?
I hope you can protect them.
See you soon.
Teacher, what was that?
Go inside.
I'll be back soon.
Well, you give, Dabi.
They just beat you.
Damn, you're weak.
So I'm really weak.
What? Are you a fool?
Don't make hasty conclusions. You're strong.
You just need to understand that the Profi are also very strong.
Copy me again, Twice.
I want to deal with the Profi.
You can't beat them, no matter how much you have.
I'll do everything right.
Already very close.
Hey, look.
Teacher!
Midoriya!
Teacher!
I'm so glad.
We have troubles.
It's too long to tell.
I have to pass on all the mandalas.
Hey, wait!
Look after Kota!
He's shocked.
Look after him, please!
Wait, Midoriya!
Your wounds...
Are you old again?
Did you forget what happened in Hoso?
For unregistered state licenses
it is forbidden to use a miracle
without special regulations.
This is a violation of the rules.
But I...
So pass on some mandalas.
Oh my God, I almost got it.
Let me pick up my weapon.
This guy predicts
all my cat punches.
You're not...
A real...
Hero in this world!
That's a parasite.
Like you.
Take your punishment!
Destroyer!
Mandalas!
Kota, are you okay?
You...
I have a message from the teacher of Aizawa.
Tell the others about him.
Right, hero.
Your students are important to you.
I hope you can protect them.
So they're hunting for students.
Then there's no choice.
We have to survive.
Protect yourself.
And when you need to get rid of them
we'll do it together.
All A and B class students
on behalf of the teacher of A3-Head
you have permission to fight.
All A and B class students
on behalf of the teacher of A3-Head
you have permission to fight.
I repeat, all A and B class students
you have permission to fight.
I hope you know what you're doing, A3-Head.
Just don't let yourself get killed,
I forgot to tell Midoriya to come back right away, it's bad, it's a standard procedure, adrenaline somehow supports him, he doesn't feel the pain yet from the shock, but after a while he won't be able to move.
Uncle, is everything going to be okay with him?
I... I hit him.
But he sacrificed himself anyway to save me.
I didn't even apologize to him.
And I didn't thank him.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I hope everything will be fine with him.
Don't worry.
Although he was hurt, he is clearly not going to die.
But as a teacher, I will have to punish him for this later.
How so?
So thank him when it all ends.
But you don't have to apologize, just thank him from the bottom of your heart.
Come back to the building right away!
Why did you come out with such wounds?
I can't, I'm sorry.
Give me something else.
The villains have one more goal.
They need Kachan.
Please use the telepathy.
Who is Kachan?
Wait a second.
So it turns out the shock.
Our team has only two people capable of this.
Well, given the leak of information, this moron with muscles lost to him.
What kind of power does this child have?
Oh my God, a child!
I just have to kill him!
Don't even think about it, sister-mage!
What are you doing?
He's on the list of those to be killed.
Only Shigaraki wants this.
Spinner, what are you doing here?
This guy deserves life in the eyes of the spot.
And this means that he has the right to be called a hero.
I just follow his advice.
Finally got it.
There is no choice.
I have to convey this message.
One of the goals of the villains has become known.
This is a student named Kachan.
Bakuga? Is this Bakuga?
Kachan, avoid any battle.
Hide and do not move.
Bakuga.
Did you understand me, Kachan?
Kachan, Kachan.
All the brains are already rumbling.
Do not put yourself under his attack.
I have to follow.
I have to do my job.
Did you hear what they told you?
You are their target.
This is clearly this bastard Deco tried.
Either fight or do not fight.
I was going to listen to them from the very beginning.
He used his surroundings well and his magic.
And he looks like some kind of shit.
Damn, how does he piss me off?
Bastard.
He is clearly very experienced.
Show me your flesh.
You understand that if you try too hard with explosions,
then you will burn the forest and we will die in the fire.
Do you understand?
I know, get down already.
And if we just run, then we will all run to the gas.
I already see how he is approaching.
I heard her, Kendo.
We have an order to fight them.
Wait, Tetsu, Tetsu, do you understand that this is gas?
Big problem, huh?
I'm not stupid.
The mandolin did not mention gas.
So he did not spread far.
And it means that he did not get to the mandolin.
It turns out that gas acts at a limited distance.
This is strange.
Gas should gradually dissipate.
And in our case, this does not happen.
It means that it is constantly released.
And look there.
Here the gas is denser than where we were.
In other words ...
I think we are close to the gas spread point.
As if the center of the hurricane.
That is, the gas comes out of the center around us and we are close to this center.
And to the one who controls it.
Here, damn it.
Kendo, you're just a genius.
It's good that I didn't let you go alone.
And if we get closer to the spread point, then our opponent is time.
The filters on the masks are not endless.
The denser the gas, the stronger they wear out.
In other words ...
We run from all legs to where the gas is denser than everything.
Well, something like that.
He is too straightforward.
But ...
The rest of the shazaks were hurt because of this gas.
It pisses me off.
I can't hold myself in my hands.
I'm going full Kendo.
Yeah.
I can't say I don't like it.
It's your feature.
They're coming again.
It seems three.
No, two people.
I should have guessed that they would find their way here.
They are the heroes of the academy, after all.
I'm sad about that.
It doesn't matter how good your charm is.
I found it!
You're just a man.
What was that sound?
A shot?
Are they Alikachans?
Oh!
Exactly!
I saw you at the festival.
A child with a miracle of purification.
A gun won't help here.
But it doesn't matter.
The only question is how long you can hold your breath.
A gun?
Are you kidding me?
He aimed right at my mask.
In addition, a heli.
School uniform?
Do we really have the same age with him?
He does not take me seriously.
Are you out of your mind?
Even if you have strength, it is useless to carry yourself like a tank.
Didn't you learn this at school?
There is no brain in the head.
Don't waste my time.
Tetsu, Tetsu!
It's bad.
Go away!
They decided to attack me from behind while one distracts.
Stupid.
What a stupid plan.
This gas comes out of me and I control it.
I feel everything that happens in its radius.
In other words, nothing will be hidden from me.
How did you even think of this?
Are you really a student of UAE?
Don't ruin my dream.
It's not surprising that our attack went smoothly.
Wait!
Idiot.
What is it?
Your skin is getting softer?
The metal is going to wear out?
Maybe a sip of fresh air will help you?
Come on, you're already tired of holding on.
Haven't you warmed up yet?
You seem to only know how to run forward by breaking your head.
But you didn't even think when you couldn't do it.
So tell me, are you going to do it?
Tell me, are you going to become a hero?
It seems strange to me.
You're getting the whole world behind you.
Just because you're stupid, you're suffering.
And it shouldn't be like that.
Damn, my lungs.
Air.
My strength.
Everything is blurring in my eyes.
I can only see black and white.
Tetsu, Tetsu!
I told you not to attack me with this gas.
The fact that you can feel the movement doesn't mean anything.
It hurts to be self-confident for such a miserable miracle.
This is your miserable miracle.
Take this!
Does it blow gas?
How strong are her hands?
You're the only one who's stupid here.
You're waving your gun, hiding behind the gas.
Oh, you!
The UAE is not as simple as you think.
I don't feel anything anymore.
We don't give up even before death.
We will always find a way out.
From any situation.
Gas.
Dissolves.
Damn gas mask.
I'll break your mask so you won't be in trouble.
Idiot.
You'll pay for ruining our rest, young lady.
The Kachans of this road went to Toremi during the road of courage.
I believe they went not far away.
They shouldn't be that far away.
Shoji?
Well, Iran is with you.
How did you get here?
Apparently, you want to save everyone with all your heart.
Well, I don't know.
What was that?
Oh, yeah.
A villain attacked us, and we began to defend ourselves.
But at that moment, his wonder went crazy.
The darker, the stronger my wonder.
But at the same time, it's harder for me to control it.
It can't be.
Yeah.
If you want to run further, you'll have to calm down first.
Get out of my way, or you'll die.
Takayami!
The sequel follows.
Takayami!
Takayami!
This is a preview.
Takayami has lost control of the dark shadow.
The Kachan can help him deal with it.
I have to make the final choice.
In the next episode...
Takayami!
Takayami!
Takayami!
Takayami!
Takayami!
Takayami!
Takayami!
Takayami!
In the next episode...
The End!
Plus Ultra!
