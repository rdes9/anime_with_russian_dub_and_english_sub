The prestigious academic institution of the I.U.A. academy, having taken the Heroic course, I continued to pursue my dream, to resist the difficulties and to save people with a smile on their faces in order to become the greatest of the heroes.

Touch the
fire!
It's time for a counterattack, let's turn the clock on our behalf.
Where is he now?
Shigaraki!
I...
...hate you!
Nomu?
Right out of the air?
What do you mean?
There are more and more of them!
What the...
Bakugo, my boy!
Damn!
Help us!
What?
What?
Toshinori, it's them.
The portal doesn't work.
And they arrive too quickly.
Really?
It's him!
Now everything is fine.
Because I am...
...a teacher.
Damn!
They'll all run away!
I won't let you!
Catch me, Shigaraki!
Shigaraki!
I missed them all!
It's not your fault.
We couldn't do anything about it.
It's not Kuragiri's portal.
It only transmits certain goals.
All-powerful!
Oklahomsky!
Destroyer!
They've made a mess here.
There's no other way.
Focus on the villains!
What kind of monsters are these?
These beasts...
Where are they from?
I can't get in touch with Jinx.
Looks like they've failed the mission.
There's no time to think about it.
Saratel!
Are you all right?
Do you think I might have a problem?
Hero number one, do you have a memory loss?
If you're going somewhere, hurry up!
Yeah...
I'm counting on you.
The symbol of the world.
What was I supposed to expect from hero number four?
Best Jinx.
I thought I blew you all up.
But you pulled everyone out of their clothes instantly.
What did you save from the explosion?
Analysis of the situation, reflexes,
as well as steel nerves.
You...
One of the best heroes in the world.
His power is comparable to the almighty.
He's very smart and cunning.
If there's even a slightest threat, he'll run away.
We need to arrest the Shigaraki gang as quickly as possible.
As quickly as possible.
Don't get me wrong,
but I won't let you get away with this.
I'm not going to let you get away with this.
I'm not going to let you get away with this.
I'm not going to let you get away with this.
I'm not going to let you get away with this.
The best heroes
should not be defeated.
I see.
Your strength requires a lot of experience and control.
I'm not going to take this.
Your trick doesn't suit the character of Tomura.
Who is this?
What's going on here?
We didn't have time to blink.
We need to run.
I realize this, but...
the body doesn't move from fear.
My body...
doesn't move.
What?
What's wrong with him?
What?
What the hell?
Kachan!
Bakuga!
I'm sorry, Bakuga.
What?
What happened?
It stinks!
It smells good.
Teacher...
Tomura was defeated.
Don't be upset.
Next time everything will work out.
I even pulled out all your friends.
And this boy too.
After all, he is an important figure for you.
You can try as many times as you want.
That's why I'm here.
All this...
for you.
Oh my God!
Why am I here?
I couldn't save him.
Because my body didn't move.
And now I'm too scared.
He's right in front of my eyes.
They don't know we're here.
Otherwise, they wouldn't talk so freely.
Kachan is six or seven meters away.
With full coverage, I'll get to him in a second.
And then what?
How do I run away?
The rest will be in trouble too.
What do I do?
I need a plan.
But I can't move.
I can't move.
No way.
I...
I'll still...
protect you.
Think.
What should we do in this situation?
And yet you came.
I'll make you answer for everything.
All for one thing.
Will you kill me again?
All-powerful, huh?
I'll make you answer for everything.
All for one thing.
Will you kill me again?
All-powerful, huh?
I'll make you answer for everything.
All for one thing.
Will you kill me again?
All-powerful, huh?
All-powerful, huh?
Why are you so slow?
It's only five kilometers from here to the bar.
I had to wait for you for as long as 30 seconds.
It looks like you're weak, All-powerful.
Look at yourself.
Why do you need this mask on your face?
You can't breathe without it.
You hit the All-powerful with your bare hands.
Is that the main thing with the villains?
I won't repeat the mistakes of five years ago.
All for one thing.
I'll bring back young Bakug
and send you to prison
together with your entire gang of villains.
And I see you want a lot of things,
just like I do.
All for one thing.

I'm coming!
I won't let you.
That's why I'm here.
All-powerful Ica-Chan
is in serious trouble. However...
Unlicensed people are not allowed to use a spell
without the permission of their guardians and leaders.
This is a violation of the rules.
We cannot give in to emotions in such a situation.
If you break the rules,
you will become nothing better than villains.
Why should it be you?
Why are you going to repeat my mistake?
We...
We cannot fight!
But there must be another way!
Think!
Just one moment!
Is there really no way to save Kachan?
If we save Kachan,
All-powerful will not have to hold back!
Where?
Where is this path?
How do we find it?
No, it won't work.
There must be another way out!
I figured it out!
The tomato!
No, we can do it!
We can save Kachan and escape!
Without getting into a fight with the villains!
Tell me.
However, everything will depend on Kachan.
Don't come any closer, Deku!
Even if you save Bakug,
he will take it as an insult.
My plan won't work if I do it.
So it's best to do it.
Kirishimi!
Tell me about your plan, Midoriya.
Yeah, that's my plan.
You're saving your strength.
Don't you want the boy to get hurt?
It's hard, isn't it?
To protect the
All-powerful can't fight because I'm here.
Damn it!
So this is your plan?
Kachan should already understand what situation he's in.
I think so.
Now Kachan is careful and keeps a distance from the enemies.
The best moment will be when he gets up at least two steps away from the villains.
Ida!
It's dangerous.
But if you think about it, the risk is not great.
But if everything works out, then we will change the situation.
Let's do it!
That's my plan.
First, we will gain speed due to full coverage and reverse acceleration of Ida.
Then Kirishimi will use her strength.
And we will break the wall.
And then Todoroki will make us an ice trampoline.
So that we can fly higher.
We will catch the villains.
Before that, only they did this.
Now we will pay back with the same.
And so we will be on the battlefield at an unattainable height.
If the main villain interferes with the omnipotent, then the omnipotent will interfere with him.
Well, the next one will be you, Kirishimi.
I'm not good for that.
Todoroki, Yauyu Rose and Ida too.
From the very beginning, you have built a relationship with him.
If you reach out to his friend, then he will definitely ...
Grab on!
He will answer!
You are idiots!
What?
Bakuga, make an explosion on the signal!
And order me, you bastard!
It's not time to hide!
Now all attention is on them.
This is our chance.
Forward!
Yes!
Where did they come from?
Here they are!
Children!
Do not let them go!
Just catch them!
Dabi and Kuragiri are both knocked out!
Grab her by the hand!
Magne!
Magnesium!
It can magnetize people at a distance of 4-5 meters from itself.
Either the whole body or some parts.
The men have a southern polarity, and the women have a northern polarity.
However, he cannot magnetize himself.
Ready!
Push-off explosion!
Night flight cannon!
Tornado!
Titan!
Mountain lady!
The priority is to save people.
Run, stupid kids!
We can still get them!
Let's do it again!
Gran Torino!
You're late.
You're too fast.
This guy, Midoriya, looks more and more like you.
He took only the bad stuff.
Despite the events in the camp, he still came.
Young people.
Shimura's friends, huh?
Let it be so, but...
This is it!
Now I can not hold back!
All for one!
There are two more!
It's time to finish them!
Tomura, do something!
They are so clever.
The situation is no longer in our favor.
Preventive activation!
Magnetism!
Turn into dust!
Easy on the turns!
Wait!
Don't, teacher!
You can not escape!
With this body, you...
No!
No one came to save you.
It must be hard, Shimura Tenko.
Everything is fine.
After all, now I'm here.
I...
I'm not done yet!
Tomura...
Keep fighting.
Teleportation!
Reverse feedback!
I'm sorry!
I came here to save Tomura.
But if you want fights, you will get it.
You killed all my comrades one after another.
And because of your immorality, you were called a symbol of peace.
All your glory is on the corpses of people.
Not bad, Tudovitsk, isn't it?
Detroit...
Destroyer!
Hold on again.
I won't let you fight in half force.
You think you can protect people around you?
Shut up.
For you, people are like toys.
You destroy, you steal, you manipulate people like puppets.
People just want to live.
And you laugh at them and destroy their work.
I can't do that!
Oh no, teleport.
I'm sorry!
Toshinori...
You've reached your limit.
What's the matter?
Did you let your emotions take over you?
I've heard such words before.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Fly away from this world.
I'll use ourtime.
We must criticizing people for this.
I won't let you fight in half force.
Please, stop the virtually bullshit.
I want you to disappear from this world.
I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it
I like this place
I realized something important
It's not what I do, who I'm with
I've been looking for
I've been looking for
I want to come tomorrow
Because there is a view I want to see with you
I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it
I like this place
No, no, I don't like it
I don't want to regret it, so I'll say it right now
I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it
I like this place
I like it, I like it, I like it
