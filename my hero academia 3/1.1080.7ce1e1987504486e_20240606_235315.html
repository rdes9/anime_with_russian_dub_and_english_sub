        <pre>The new semester of the U.A. Academy, in a world where 80% of humanity has the power to call it a miracle,
there is a prestigious academy for future heroes who are able to resist evil.
I am a student of this academy, Midoriya Izuku. I continue to pursue my dream, to become the one who saves people with a smile.
Yes, this story is about how I became the greatest hero.
What's going on?
My Heroic Academy, 3rd season
Summer Heroic Edition
Summer Heroic Edition
With us is the number one hero from the U.A. Academy.
In this issue, we will talk about the feats of the Almighty and his...
I caught up.
Why did the killer of the heroes annoy me so much?
And why did those snores annoy me so much?
It's all because of the Almighty.
Because he always has a smile on his face.
And he can save anyone.
It's all because of his stupid smile.
Midoriya Izuku
He was a fool until he graduated from high school.
But then he suddenly found her.
In April of this year, after entering the U.A., he proved himself, taking 8th place at the sports festival.
And then, during the incident in Hozu, he fought with his friends with the killer of the heroes and was able to overcome him.
That time, the killer of the heroes saved his life.
A boy who was recognized as a killer of the heroes, who was only looking for worthy ones.
A complete opposite of Shigaraki Tomuri.
I will create it myself.
A world without the Almighty.
And I will show everyone.
How fragile justice is.
Episode 1. The game begins.
The first semester in the U.A. academy is over.
And summer vacations have come.
But now is not the time for games.
To prepare for the training camp in nature, I continued my training.
See?
He has already saved hundreds of people.
This is madness.
Everything happened in some 10 minutes.
Full of nonsense.
He's laughing.
Now everything is fine.
Why?
Because I'm here.
The Almighty.
Sometimes it seems to me that this is all a dream.
That the Almighty chose me and passed on his miracle.
Mineta-kun?
Kaminari?
Hi Midoriya.
Let's go to the pool.
To the pool?
Yes.
To the summer camp.
Let's go all out.
Vlad.
About the training in the camp to increase endurance.
Washerman, couldn't you tell about the miracles of Haklas before that?
Okay.
The first on the list.
Aoyama Yuga.
The miracle is a button laser.
Shoots with a laser from the butt.
The second one.
Ashadumina.
The miracle is acid.
It emits acid, which dissolves most of the material.

The fifth one.
Uraraka Uchaku.

The eyes, ears, mouth or hands grow away from its tentacles.
The twelfth one.

It uses ear plugs to distinguish the slightest vibration of sound
or to enhance the sound of the blows of your heart with the help of the speakers.
The thirteenth one.
Seruhanto.

The miracle is invisibility.
But it is always invisible.
The seventeenth one.
Bakugukatsuki.
The miracle is an explosion.
Nitroglycerin released by its palms can explode.

It enhances any end or the whole body,
sharply increasing physical data.
The nineteenth one.
Mineda Minoru.
The miracle is a ball.
It can remove hair from the head and attach them or throw them.
The twelfth one.
Yaoirozu Momo.
The miracle is creation.
It can make any non-living object from an element in its body.
That's all.
I would like to go through the B-class miracles.
Excuse me.
What do you want, guys?
Teacher Aizawa, we are talking about the blank about the pool that we served yesterday.
Ah, the academy gave permission.
The pool is yours until five in the evening.
Yeah?
Thank you very much.
They wrote that you will conduct endurance training there, right?
You try.
Of course.
The pool for endurance training.
You are a genius, Mineda-kun.
If we are in the academy, then we can use the miracle.
Perfect for training.
No, no, no, no, no.
We are the Heroic Faculty.
Forward!
Plus Ultra!
Ultra!
The choice of a suitable Midoriya was right, Mineda.
If only we were there, we would not have been given permission, right?
By the way, will there be any problems with this?
That's enough.
I accidentally eavesdropped when the exams were over.
We were forbidden to go far on vacation?
In general, the academy insisted on this.
Sad.
My parents and I planned to go to Venice.
Well, you are a major!
Damn, I bought a new swimwear.
What to do?
We were attacked by a group of villains.
And what about that?
I want to play, I want to walk!
Then let's have fun together on vacation in the academy pool.
Exactly.
If we are in the academy walls, the teachers will definitely give us good.
Great.
And we save money.
It's better than sitting at home.
Then I'll go ask for permission.
Here it is!
What?
We just have to be there!
It's time to look at the girls anew!
Let's go!
Through the gates of paradise!
Why are you late?
Hey, what the hell?
What are you all doing here?
Since we have training for endurance in the pool, I wrote to the rest to come if they want.
So that's how it is.
And who are you, Midoriya?
Calm down, Kaminaria.
The girls will definitely surprise us with swimsuits.
I already see this.
Their amazing swimsuits!
What? Mineta-chan?
Kaminaria is also here.
What the hell am I watching?
Where is Bikini?
Swimsuits in the academy are nothing.
Have you already given up?
Kaminaria-kun, Mineta-kun.
The idea to practice in the academy pool was excellent.
I'm impressed.
Well, smell the smell of sweat with us!
Ahahaha!
Hey, wait!
Wait!
Wait!
Damn it!
Wipe it!
The sound is specially for Gym Club.
The site of the VK group is vk.com-slash-gym-fans.
Let's go!
Okay, let's do a 15-minute break.
I got everyone here.
Fly!
Wow!
And the old man is a mage!
I'm right in front of the cross! Thank you!
Why are the girls having fun without us?
They have permission to play in the pool.
Mineta!
Damn it, I pulled you to write about training!
Then we would not be allowed!
And you pumped up, huh?
Yes, I trained since the very beginning of the vacation.
In life training.
Midoriya!
Take a little break.
Thank you, Ida.
What?
No, it's just strange.
At the entrance exam, I did not think that I could make friends with you.
To be honest, I didn't think much about it then.
But at the end of that exam ...
Midoriya, I'm sorry, I didn't think much about it then.
Hit!
You put the life of Uraraki above passing the exam.
How can the Heroic Faculty refuse people who save others and do the right thing?
It's a matter of whether you agree or not!
Go!
Midoriya, my boy.
This is your Heroic Academy!
Yes, I'm happy.
Studying at the academy where I studied the Almighty has always been my dream.
But when the worst was threatened to be excluded at the physical tests ...
I thought it was over.
But you didn't give up.
Not then, not now.
The Detroit ...
... Crash!
What?
Improved special technique!
Meteorite Home Run!
And this is a Home Run?
We won!
That's it!
What was I thinking about?
Yes, your methods are often reckless.
But I felt your spirit, Midoriya.
I think this is what we lack with Bakug.
That's for sure.
I'm here only thanks to all of you.
Therefore, I will try harder!
Of course!
As if I lose to a fucking botanist like you!
Kachan?
I got your SMS, but I was a little late, sorry.
Bakug was very bombed, so we were delayed.
Here it is.
Hey, asshole!
Do you want to swing right now, huh?
No, we are ...
Really?
You won't be fed with one workout.
Guys, do you want to arrange a 50-meter swim to the fastest name?
Cool!
Tato!
We will help you.
Thank you.
Can we use the reason?
We are in the academy, so we can.
However, it is forbidden to spoil property and harm people.
Deku, you are a bitch!
And you are also a fool.
So, on the position.
Attention!
Explosive jump!
Well, losers!
Hey, it's not fair!
You did not swim at all!
This is freestyle!
On the start!
Attention!
Cows!
Actually, you have to swim!
On the start!
Attention!
And you there too!
One for all!
Full coverage!
What a fall!
Well done, Midoriya!
Almost!
You won, Midoriya!
You are cool too, yes!
Midoriya?
If you have something from hero number one,
then I have another reason to beat you.
Taking the first place,
without the surprise of that old man,
I will completely renounce him.
Do you want to win only half the surprise?
Do you know?
I did not miss a single blow!
Show me all your strength!
This is your strength, right?
I also want to be a hero!
Are you sure you are a killer, hero?
I am!
I am the younger brother
of the crippled hero!
The younger brother
who admired them!
I came to put an end
to your treachery!
You are weak!
Just like your brother!
Because you are a fake!
Destroyer!
I came to save you, Ida!
Because of you I was late.
Together we will protect them!
Why?
You two!
Why?
Stop!
I inherited the nickname of the brother!
Stop!
I am more!
If you want to stop us,
get up first!
Decide who you want to be!
I swear
that I will become a hero
worthy of my brother!
I will also become a hero
who I always dreamed of being!
And I will become the same
as the Almighty,
who saves people with a smile!
The League of Villains
attacked Yuei
and was attacked.
This was called the KNS incident.
Then the case
with the murder of the heroes
and the League of Villains Hozuo.
It was called the Hozuo incident.
And finally,
when Namidori Iizuku,
a student of Yuei,
came across the alleged leader
of the Villains League,
Shigaraki Tomura,
since then the League of Villains
has not taken any action.
You should be sad.
I agree.
The police should cooperate with the heroes
to get information about the Villains League.
When the search will give results,
do not let the Almighty down.
Of course, Tsukauchi-kun.
The winners of the previous races
Bakugo, Todoroki and Midori
will fight for the first place!
Agree?
Yes.
Do not give up,
as it was at the sports festival.
Fight to the fullest!
As you say.
And you too, Deku!
I understand, Kachan.
So,
let's start the 50-meter swim!
Burn it, Bakugo!
Just don't kill anyone!
Todoroki, don't be a coward!
Deku, come on!
Guys, try!
I'll fly in a second.
I'll go on a slide.
I'll swim to the maximum.
Attention!
What?
Did they suddenly disappear?
It's already five in the evening.
You spent your time out of the window.
Get ready to go home.
Teacher!
At the most interesting place!
Did you say something?
No, sir! Yes, sir!
Damn it!
What a
hell!
I understand, but stop bombing!
Midori and Todoroki are still our classmates.
Shut up!
I will not allow anyone to catch up or overtake me!
Isn't that what it means to be better than the omnipotent?
Better than number one!
You have 10 months before the entrance exam.
You must become a suitable vessel.
Midori?
Omnipotent?
What are you doing here?
What about you?
Well, I ...
You can become a hero!
You!
And only you can I become a hero!
You!
And only you can I become a hero!
You!
And only you can I become a hero!
And only you can I become a hero!
And only you can I become a hero!
I was given a miracle as a sacred torch!
I was given a miracle as a sacred torch!
The ability to transmit a miracle and
endlessly accumulate strength!
This is what I inherited!
And the name of this miracle is one for all!
And the name of this miracle is one for all!
And now I pass it to you!
And now I pass it to you!
And now I pass it to you!
Here ...
everything started for me!
Young Midori!
The summer camp will not be cold!
You hold on there!
Yes!
The continuation follows!

Has the grounds for the camp changed?
It's a precautionary measure.
Information on the occassion of leakage.
And in the Academy too-
few knowing about it.
Keep it a secret!
Even from the students!
I need you to do something.
That's right.
We're starting a new game.
