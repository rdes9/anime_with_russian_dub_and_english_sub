John, when I entered the Academy of the Heroes building, I followed my dreams.
In order to confront the difficulties chain and save the people who are smiling.
I was helping to become THE history human was going to be in!
Here we go, the Road to the Edge
It's my life
One and only
No matter how many times I shed tears, I won't stop
I don't expect it to be simple days
Follow my way
Take me to the gloom
Follow my way
I aim for the future
It's like a dream
I know what I have to do now
I've found the right answer
In so many different lives
Make my story
I'm the only one
I'm the only one
I'm the only one
I'm the only one
I'm the only one
I'm the only one
I'm the only one
I want to live forever
I'm sure one day
The day will come when I'll cry
When I look back
I want to make my way
One and only
I see
So you decided to switch to legs?
If you have problems with your hands, work with your legs
It's just brilliant
I like the way you think
I'll get you a couple of babies for your legs
I don't want to change my costume
It's okay, I'll fulfill any of your stupid requirements
Teacher, if my invention is good, will you approve the production?
If it's good, then yes
My opinion doesn't count
Since you've decided to develop the strength of your legs
Then you should be the same speedy hero as Ida
That's true
Ida has a lot of weight and height
That's why he's like a tank on Formula 1
First you need to become the same as he is
Wait!
I can completely cover my body with strength
And equally strengthen all parts of my body
Wow, then everything is much easier
Four days later
New technique
Armored fire!
Got it!
Be careful!
I came up with this idea thanks to Granta Riina and Kachano
Taking manoeuvrability as the basis of speed
To support the miracle, I needed equipment
Enhancing it, hand stabilizers
And iron foot pegs
Destroyer!
This costume was made by Hatsume for me
This is my new costume!
Gamma!
Exam
All-powerful, are you okay?
Yeah
Wow
What was that, Midoriya?
Another destructive power
And I thought you like to wave with fists
Kamenari, Kirishima
I achieved this power thanks to the sole made by Hatsume
I changed the style of the fight using Luide
I've just decided on the direction
But it can't be called a super technique
I haven't invented any super technique yet
No
I think that will be enough
For a temporary license, for sure
All-powerful, it's dangerous to be here
Yeah, sorry
Bakugo, my boy, I'm sorry
Tch
Look around, all-powerful!
Look around, huh?
Looks like I'll have to do it now
Now I'm the one who needs protection
Do you have new costumes too?
Did you notice?
Not only did you invent a new style
The rest didn't sit still
You can't get away from them
But my style is still the best
The roof will fall off when you see it
You want to see it, don't you?
Your time is up, class
Class B will be held until noon today
Class B?
Damn, it's like you've just guessed
Look, boss, clear the room
We have 10 minutes left
I'll squeeze everything out of this time, Vlad
Have you heard that half of those who pass exams don't pass it?
So maybe you'll all screw him up?
He only does what makes everyone feel bad
Listen, why does Mano have such a costume?
He has a copy of a miracle
And he needs a costume in which he won't stand out
And he doesn't stand out in this
In his words, there is a share of the truth
By passing the exam, we will destroy others
We are intended to walk on each other's heads
That is why we have our exams in different places
The exam is held twice a year
In June and September
In three different places all over the country at the same time
To avoid fighting and hatred of students
Teachers prescribe a theory
The division of students into different groups
It's a pity that we won't be able to destroy you personally
And again he's for his own
Is this some kind of new kind of psychological instability or something?
Each school?
I've already forgotten that schools will interfere with each other
By the way, we skipped a couple of courses
In general, your opponents will be children who had more time to prepare
In other words, the first years have less chances to get a license
They polished their skills better than you
The content of the exam is unknown
However, you should not be too worried or relaxed
And you do not need to get hooked on it
Just keep it in your head
Yes!
Damn, I'm so tired
They did not joke about enhanced training
Before the exam, we will not even have a break
I'm Oimouma, how is your high school going?
I have an idea, but it does not work yet
I will work on improving my skills
And you, Shuto?
I'm already finishing my super legushachi technique
I think you will be impressed, Toru
And you, how is Chako?
And Chako?
Are you very tired?
No, I'm not tired at all
I'm still full of strength
I would like to say, but I do not know
I feel very strange
She fell in love!
What?
Joked?
Bought?
Forgot?
I do not understand what you are
It's Midori and Lida
You only spend time with them
It's not like that
Not like that, not like that, not like that
And she flew away
Well, who are they?
Come on, tell us
You will not hide from us
If you tell us, it will be easier for you
It's not true!
I do not understand what you are talking about
You ask, this is not beautiful
That's right
It's too early to get up tomorrow, so let's go to bed
Well, no
I want to know everything
If it's about love, then do not stop me
Well, you know what?
Not like that
I do not understand
Not like that
You need to do like Ida
He moves more body
Shoulder forward, hand back
You need to create an image in your head
I think I can show a super technique
Not like that
The trainings flew by unnoticed
Test day
Damn, my nerves are shaking
I wonder what we have to do
Can I get a license?
Vinetta, I can not
Do not come back without a license
That's right, I understand you
If you pass the exam for a license
Then from kittens turn into tigers
You will get the title of semi-professionals
Get out to the full
Great, I'm a tiger
We will surprise everyone
Together
Plus
Ultra
Do not sneak up on people when they do not ask you for a nose
Well, damn
Accept
My
Deepest
Apologies
What's wrong with his head?
He justifies any of his stupidity
This is Jack
Oh, I know this uniform
They are from the West
In the East is UAE
And in the West is Shiketsu
The academy that can compete with UAE on equal
Shiketsu Academy
I always dreamed of screaming plus ultra
I love UAE
I'm so happy that I will fight against you
I look only forward
Oh, you have blood
Let's go
Yoroshinos
Teacher, do you know him?
Yes, he is very strong
In the last year, when you passed the entrance exam
Yoarashi was the best from those who received the recommendation
But for some reason he refused to come to us
What?
He is a freshman?
If he was the best of those who received the recommendation
Does that mean he is stronger than Todoroki?
Shiketsu Academy
Yoarashi and NASA
Sounded specially for Gym Club
The site of the VKontakte group vk.com slash gym farts
So, guys from UAE
Forgive me, please
His name is Yoarashi NASA
If he loves UAE so much, why did he refuse to come?
Yes, he is strange
He is strange, but very strong
Follow him
Stork
Oh, it's you, Stork
I saw you
I saw you on TV at the festival
Long time no see
Who is it?
Marry me
I don't want to
I don't want to say
How funny
Your sense of humor has not disappeared
Smiling hero
Miss Joke
Her miracle is an explosive joke
She makes everyone around laugh
Her battle with villains is a real show
If you marry me, we will have an eternally smiling family
Such a family will not make me happy
You are pretty close
We worked in the same agency
We constantly helped each other
Relations built on love
It's all a lie
I always liked your quick replies
You were fun, Stork
Joke
Stork
Joke
Did you bring the students?
Yes
Come here, guys
This is UAE
Wow, they are true
Cool, cool
I only saw them on TV
Ketsubutsu Academy
2nd year of the Heroic Course
These are my kids, say hello to them
My name is Shindo
You probably had a hard time because of all the events
Oh, well
But thanks to this, you have strengthened your resolve
It's amazing
The heart must be strong
Each hero needs such a strong spirit
What a inspiring
Amazing straight-line dude
And together with them, the main participant of the stone incident, Bakugo
What?
You have the strongest heart
It's a great honor for me to stand next to you
Stop blabbering, hypocrite
I see how you look at me
Stop being rude to everyone
I'm sorry, he's so...
It's okay, for a person with such a spirit
Hey, you, dork, can I have your autograph?
I really liked you at the festival
Oh, stop it, fan
I'll give you an autograph too
So, quickly change your costumes for the briefing
Don't waste your time
Yes
It's so unusual, we are famous
Students at UAE recognize him everywhere
It can't be
Did you tell them anything, stork?
So many
So many
So, let's start the briefing
I am the chairman of the public security
My name is Mayor
My favorite phrase is
Sleep without dreams
Nice to meet you
I almost don't sleep, there's a lot of work
We have too few people
I want to sleep
But it doesn't matter for you
Let me explain
He doesn't hide his fatigue
Is he really okay?
So, the content of your exam
There are 1540 people here
First, let's reduce the number of participants
Seriously?
Right away?
We live in a world where there are a lot of heroes
Since the moment the spot was arrested
Many are wondering if the heroes are effective
The hero should not demand compensation for his help
This is a title, and he should sacrifice himself for the sake of others
The main reasons for the murder of heroes
Well, people think quite primitively
The hero should save the rest of the people and not demand anything in return
This is a merciless opinion of society at the moment
But everyone decides for himself whether he wants money or works with pure enthusiasm
Does he save people or hunt for villains?
With time, the number of people who want to work with enthusiasm has decreased
We all want to eat here
Everyone who gets a license will be finally thrown into this crazy world
Those who find it difficult to understand this will have the hardest time
We will check your speed
Only the first 100 participants will pass
But there are 1540 people here
What happens then?
Only 5% will pass
Now I'm even more nervous
There are a lot of things in the world that have happened in recent times
And we will have to deal with it
Now I will tell you about the conditions of the passage
Each participant will have three targets on the body
However, you must place them in the open area
Places like stairs or under the mice are prohibited
And you will get six balls
If the ball hits the target, it will light up
If you are struck by all the targets, you will fly out
The participant who hit the last target gets the so-called frag
The student who got two frags goes on
What are the rules?
Almost like an entrance exam
No, it's harder to fight with people than with robots
We have very few balls to defeat
The effective strategy will be stealth
Are you recommending such a strategy?
It's much harder than an entrance exam
Okay, after the expansion, we will give you the balls and the targets
In a minute, the exam will begin
Expansion?
I recommend finding a comfortable place for yourself
Use your mind and use your mind
Good luck
Unbelievable scales!
We have opened the conditions to the last
But it doesn't matter
I can't sleep until the end of the exam
I can't sleep until the end of the exam
I can't sleep until the end of the exam
I can't sleep until the end of the exam
I can't sleep until the end of the exam
If they finished faster, I could sleep
I expect a speedy development
Your skirt is stretched
Why are there so many annoying people around me?
So you have 20 kids?
It's amazing that you haven't excluded anyone yet
Did you fall in love with this class?
Not at all
Don't be embarrassed, you're so
Marry me
Shut up
But this is really strange
I don't believe they don't know that
If we want to win, there is no point in competing with our own
The best thing will be to act in the team
Guys, don't run away, let's act together
Yeah
Right
Fuck you, this is not a walk in the park
Balwan, wait
Kachan
Kirishima
I'll go alone too
It's hard to use my magic in a crowd of people
Tadaroki
Midoriya, we don't have time, let's go
Yeah
Every time the same thing
This is already a kind of tradition
This is a good idea, but I think it won't work
Why?
Because everyone knows what kind of magic we have
They already know?
Exactly, a sports festival
In this battle, different schools compete for their license
Only one has no advantage
A school that has shown all its abilities to the world
Opened not only its own miracles, but also strong and weak sides
And this is your academy
Other academies have long learned our strong and weak sides
If it comes to the battle between academies
It's obvious which academy is best to choose your victim
It can't be
Really?
The first exam has begun
If you love your class so much, then you should explain such an important detail to them
Every time the same thing is repeated
They will destroy you
I knew it
You have an interesting strength
Are you breaking bones by yourself?
The higher you stand, the more painful it is to fall
I think this will be enough
For a temporary license, for sure
One for all
Full coverage
Killing style
They will destroy you, you say?
Why would they know such nonsense?
It won't change what they need to do
They just need to overcome this little difficulty
Dark shadow!
Got it!
Great!
Get it!
To be a hero means to surpass yourself
When you become a pro, the whole world knows about you
I'm sorry to say this, but we will watch the rest of the academies
It won't work
My killing style and strength, guys
We will show what we have learned in training
Guys, don't back down and don't give up!
Yes!

This is a preview
The first exam for the license has begun
In the end, I will separate from my class and then
A girl from Shiketsu will appear in front of me
In the next episode, the Shiketsu Academy strikes a blow
Go beyond the limits plus Ultra
