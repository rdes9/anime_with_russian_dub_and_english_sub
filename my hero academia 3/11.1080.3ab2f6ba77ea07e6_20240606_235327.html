        <pre>I want to get up on this path I want to create a world in which everyone will be happy to smile for this world
a symbol is needed a symbol a symbol of the world crime is becoming more and more citizens do not have
support they do not have a pillar on which they can rely and I decided that I would become this pillar
that's why you want to become a hero even without a miracle, yes, I'm a ghettish nori, right, and you are really funny, a real psycho
yes, I'm a ghettish nori, yes, I'm a ghettish nori, yes, I'm a ghettish nori, yes, I'm a ghettish nori, yes, I'm a ghettish nori, yes, I'm a ghettish nori, yes, I'm a ghettish nori, yes, I'm a ghettish nori, yes, I'm a ghettish nori, yes, I'm a ghettish nori, yes, I'm a ghettish nori, yes, I'm a ghettish nori, yes, I'm a ghettish nori, yes, I'm a ghettish nori, yes, I'm a ghettish nori, yes, I'm a ghettish nori, yes, I'm a ghettish nori, yes, I'm a ghettish nori, yes, I'm a ghettish nori, yes, I'm a ghettish nori, yes, I
can't
It's like that. We ran away to the other side.
Here people are taken out by the heroes of the prof.
That's good. We're standing in front of the train station.
We were not hit by the wave. The rescue went well.
No one saved me. They ran away.
I decided to run away with you myself.
As you say.
I just didn't want to get in the way of the Almighty.
Exactly. We only got in the way of him.
It was the best way out of the situation.
There's also the Grand Arena.
I hope we did the right thing.
It's gonna be all right.
The Almighty.
I've already heard that.
From the previous owner of one for all.
Shimura Nane.
Be proud of it, Toshinori.
You are not one of those who received a miracle from birth.
You deserve your miracle.
Don't you dare say her name with your dirty mouth.
She was talking about her ideals all the time.
But she couldn't do anything.
For a hero with such a pathos, she was very helpless.
Her death is a real shame for a hero.
What should I start with?
Enough!
Teacher!
He's in the way again.
The same thing happened six years ago.
Toshinori, calm down.
You got into his provocation and let him run away.
In addition, I got to arm myself.
It's not hard to provoke you.
Just don't talk to him.
Yes.
His strategies and miracles have changed.
Don't get in his way.
Be smarter.
Can you move?
Get to the bottom of it.
The panel is gone.
Yes.
It's a nightmare.
Half of the stone has been destroyed by one blow.
The All-Powerful is fighting the leader of the gang of villains.
It's unbelievable.
There's only one villain there.
He destroys the whole street and fights with the symbol of the world.
Our plan was ruined.
The All-Powerful.
What's going on?
The half of the city is destroyed.
The All-Powerful barely breathes.
He got the banner.
Where's the stone?
Dad has a day off tomorrow.
What are the other heroes doing?
Are the villains doing what they want?
Or are the heroes not heroes?
They're just showing off.
It looks like the truth.
Yes, now everything is fine.
I'm a little confused.
Tomura worked hard to gain the trust of the heroes.
I think I can finish his job.
But you know what, All-Powerful?
Did you know that I hate you?
As much as you hate me.
I killed your teacher.
And you took something valuable from me.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
It attacks again.
Dodge and attack.
I'm sure it will be right.
Hey!
I'll take what you want to protect.
You're risking your life to protect your pride.
Show the world what the real symbol of the world is.
What?
What kind of skeleton is this?
Who is this?
You all see this?
The Almighty has lost weight.
The world doesn't know about this.
I want everything to remain the way it is.
I save people with a smile.
As a symbol of the world, I cannot give up the evil.
The secret of the Almighty.
Half cheeks and eyes.
A pathetic sight, not the best hero.
But you don't have to be ashamed.
After all, this is your real form.
I see.
My body can rot and become ugly.
Even if the world sees me like this.
My confidence will not disappear.
I am still a symbol of the world.
And someone like you can't shake my confidence.
Great.
I lost.
I have already forgotten how stubborn you were.
In this case, one more news will not disappoint you.
So, Shigaraki Tumura, grandson of Shimura Nane.
I was wondering if it would surprise you.
I gave you the opportunity to meet.
But you crushed it.
And smiled without suspecting anything.
This is a lie.
This is the truth.
You understand it yourself.
You know that I never lie.
I'm interested in the Almighty.
Where did you go?
Where did your smile go?
When you save someone, you need to remember what horror this person has gone through.
You need to save not only life, but also the heart.
This is a hero.
No matter how scared you are, you must continue to smile.
After all, only the strongest smile under any circumstances.
You rascal.
I knew it would be fun.
I think I've warmed up a piece of your confidence.
He is a relative of my teacher.
How is this possible?
No.
Lose.
Almighty.
Please.
Help.
Almighty.
Is everything so bad?
Don't lose.
Oh no.
It's a mess.
Almighty.
If not you, then who will win?
What difference does it make how he looks?
Almighty is still Almighty.
After all, he always managed to save us, no matter what.
Come on, Almighty.
Don't lose.
Try.
Win.
Win.
Almighty.
Well, of course, young people.
Yes, you are right.
In the world of everything, you need to protect everyone for one.
Therefore, I will not lose.
Toshinori.
If you have reached your limit, then remember.
I remember.
Why are you pressing your fists?
For what?
Why did you get on this path?
And allow these memories to overcome their limits.
I want to get on this path.
I want to create a world where everyone will be happy to smile.
How long will he still be able to fight?
He has already overcome his limit.
He can only hold the form in his right hand.
This can be seen from his body.
With the strength that remains in you, you will only be enough for one blow.
Wounded heroes scare the most.
I remember your face.
When you chased me with a disheveled belly.
It still dreams me in nightmares.
Damn it.
You will try to do even more.
What's wrong with you?
What a miserable look, Almighty!
It looks like we're on time.
All enemy Nomu are neutralized.
Help the Almighty.
He knew everything would turn out exactly like that.
Oh, you were middle school students not long ago.
I didn't think you would overcome Nomu so quickly.
However, it is quite expected from hero number two.
Almighty!
I dedicated my life to training to surpass you.
No matter how hard I trained,
I was just even more convinced of how great the gap between us was.
I felt helplessness.
What a miserable look!
Effort.
If you are here for moral support, then I will ask you to watch silently.
Shut up yourself!
We are here to help you.
This is our mission.
Good job, mountain lady.
Beautiful Kamui.
Almighty!
This is all we can help you with.
But we will be happy if you take off some of your weight from your shoulders.
Stop this monster, Almighty.
Everyone is hoping for your victory.
Your appearance doesn't matter.
You are still hero number one.
Yagi Toshinori?
I like this guy.
He is crazy.
He says that crime continues to grow because residents are afraid of the authorities.
He says that society has no support.
And he is ready to become this support.
Toshinori, you became this support.
The support that will not break.
You are hero number one.
You hear them, don't you?
Even when he threatens to show your weakened body, they still continue to support you.
They all wish you victory.
The voices of your students.
The voices of the heroes who believe in you.
Almighty!
I'm tired of you.
Enough of sentiments.
It's time to return to reality.
Metal skeleton.
Four explosive.
Three amplifying.
Strap.
Fever.
Bone storm.
Reinforcement.
Enhancement.
Before this moment, I just wanted to weaken you, not kill you.
But for your murder, I have gathered the most suitable combination of spells.
And you definitely can't survive this.
I will destroy you with one blow, Almighty.
One of them is no longer your spell.
You use only its remnants.
You begin to suffocate.
And after each use, your fire is getting weaker.
A fire that will extinguish even without my intervention.
Midoriya Izuku!
Did you give this to him?
He is not ready yet.
But he still came here.
You will die without teaching him, Almighty.
After all, even as a teacher, you lost.
Reverse feedback.
Right.
As a teacher, I undoubtedly gave a blow.
I am ready to accept my mistake.
I see.
Your weak flame will be extinguished without my intervention.
But you continue to support him, understanding that this is useless.
What a shame!
If you understand that you have reached the limit, remember.
I am more than just a symbol of the world.
As my teacher did for me, so I will do it for him.
Since then...
How does he continue with such desperate resistance?
I did not...
I calculated.
I will not die for nothing in the world!
Do not go to him.
Be smarter.
He transferred the remnants of his strength to another hand to strike.
The right hand was a trap.
And that's all you can do?
How can you not beat me?
Slav!
I'm still...
I'm completely exhausted!
This power is transferred from generation to generation, accumulating experience and strength.
I hope it will still serve people.
That all their hopes will become one.
Your turn has come.
Good luck, Toshinori.
Goodbye.
All for one.
The United States!
Destroyer!
Goodbye.
All for one.
All for one.
All for one.
Almighty!
The villain does not move!
Victory for the Almighty!
He has become a victorious pose!
Maybe it's not worth using your strength now?
Let him use it.
He has not finished his job yet.
This is his job.
Support the symbol of the world.
All for one.
All for one.
All for one.
All for one.
There are two people down there.
And there are three.
The heroes continued to save the victims after the victory of the Almighty.
But a large number of victims are expected.
Oh, they put him in the Iron Lady under the supervision of the Almighty.
All the heroes are still in a state of increased readiness.
The trains are not moving now.
Can we leave?
I couldn't keep an eye on where Todoroki and Yoyorozu went.
In any case, let's go.
We must report to the heroes that Bakugo is with us.
Yes, you are right.
Yeah.
You are next.
Now it's your turn.
The Almighty!
So cool, even after all the events!
A short message from the Almighty.
It would seem that it was addressed to the criminals.
That the symbol of the world is still alive.
But I realized that he said it to me.
I used everything I had.
