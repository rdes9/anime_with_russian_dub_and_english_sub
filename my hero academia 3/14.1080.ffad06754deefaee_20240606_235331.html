My Heroic Academy, Season 3
My Heroic Academy, Season 3
My Heroic Academy, Season 3
Midoriya, my boy.
I...
My time has passed.
My body can no longer fight.
The fire of one for all has finally extinguished in me,
and I can no longer maintain my true form.
Why do you continue to destroy the very hell once and for all?
Why do you continue to destroy your body?
But this time you surpassed yourself!
You got away from danger.
You got away from danger. You're absolutely harmless.
You got away from danger. You're absolutely harmless.
I'm so glad about that.
From this moment on, I will be spending more time on your development.
From this moment on, I will be spending more time on your development.
No matter how difficult it is, we will make it.
All-powerful!
I...
All-powerful!
What?
What?
That's right. I'm not home anymore.
Good morning.
After two attacks by the League of Villains,
to protect their students,
UAE switched to a dormitory system.
The dormitory is located five minutes away from UAE,
and it's the third day we've been living together with the guys.
That's how our new heroic life began.
The days to become a hero...
I'm going to be one of them.
Because for that, I inherited his miracle.
One for all.
The legacy of the All-Powerful.
Super-matches for an ambulance.
As I said yesterday,
our primary task will be to issue you a license as soon as possible.
Got it!
Your future lives will depend on the hero's license,
so take this seriously.
The exam will, of course, be very strict.
Only half of the students managed to pass this exam in all times.
Such difficulties for a temporary license?
Our teaching staff will ensure that you pass at least two.
So-called super-matches.
Super-matches?
School routine is behind!
Let's finally get down to business!
Super-matches.
In other words, your special skills that will bring you victory.
They shouldn't be an imitation of other people's techniques.
You must develop your own unique skills.
They must become your reflection.
A hero can't call himself a hero without super-matches.
We'll discuss and show everything at the practical class.
Put on your costumes and get ready for the gamma gym.
The gamma gym, formerly known as a dining room for active training, is a garden.
Garden?
There's a mouse hanging here!
This gym is my invention.
I can equip it as it should be needed for training.
I can make a dining room at any time.
I see.
I have a question.
Why are super-matches so important for getting a license?
Do you want to know the reason?
I'll explain everything now.
Calm down.
A hero's job is to save people, whether it's a disaster, a fire or a thief.
Natural causes or a technological disaster.
Your aptitude for this will be evaluated at the exam.
The aptitude for this...
Procedure, agility, observance and combat training.
The ability of communication, charisma and psychological stability are also important.
Every year we will test you on these criteria.
But the most important thing, of course, is combat training.
You have to be good in this area.
The presence of super-matches will seriously affect the exam results.
Besides, you are able to maintain calm and clarity of mind.
So you think you're ready for any battle.
Your super-match doesn't necessarily have to be attacking.
For example, Ida's reverse acceleration.
Multiple speed increases deserve the title of super-match itself.
Even the teachers have recognized this super-match!
I see.
So our miracle itself will give us an advantage?
That's right.
I think you've all seen how he behaves in the battle of the wooden stone.
His lacquered chains are his super-matches.
He immobilizes the opponent before someone has time to do something.
Improving your skills in the camp should have helped you create the techniques.
In other words...
The next 10 days before the beginning of the semester you will work twice as hard.
Simultaneously strengthening your skills and learning the techniques.
Training for elimination.
Moreover, your costumes will also be improved.
So that you can work more confidently with the miracles.
Your task is to break all these obstacles with the plus and ultra keys.
Are you ready?
Yes!
We're waiting for that!
What should I do?
You didn't come up with anything smarter than just using your tail.
You'll have to start from scratch.
Yeah.
But I don't have anything else unusual.
Super-match!
Acid shot from the hands!
How do you like it?
Try to fold your palm more tightly to increase the pressure of the excreting acid.
Like this.
Wow, now I'm going to hit further.
We will train your technique for accuracy.
Shooting for small targets.
Create two items at the same time.
Start with something simple.
Yes!
The guys are already training.
Why aren't you doing anything?
Well, you know, I'm thinking about my technique.
My hands can't stand my magic.
And I don't even know where to start now.
You're right.
Your magic is hard to call stable.
You'll have to choose a new fighting style.
But first of all, improve your magic.
Guest.
They're working hard.
All-powerful.
Because...
I'm here.
At least no one asked me to do this.
Go better heal your wounds.
Yes, they need to be prepared for the semester.
Come on, don't chase me.
Are they already learning super-matches?
You know, I can't miss this.
Because I'm his teacher.
It seems he has a problem.
Get it!
I feel so good!
Ectoplasm!
You're dead again!
Give me another one!
And he's good.
Yes, and he will definitely become even stronger.
Wow, Bakug is burning!
He probably has a whole bunch of super-matches.
He also gave them names from the entrance exams.
Get it together.
Got it!
I've had a super-match for a long time too.
And it's called...
Grapefruit Squall!
It's clear that everyone has already thought about it.
I'm thinking about creating a sword from electricity.
I want to learn how to create it.
How can I create a super-match with such hands?
Hey!
All-powerful!
A little hint.
Stop trying to copy me.
Huh?
What do you mean?
Hey, Kirishima, my boy!
All-powerful?
I have a piece of advice for you.
Don't try to make something smart out of your magic.
Go ahead like a bulldozer.
Got it!
I can't give you a direct answer.
Think, my boy.
Even if you make a mistake, you have to come to the solution yourself.
Jiro, my girl.
I have a piece of advice for you.
What do you have in your pocket?
Even mannequins can be teachers.
Teaching lessons for teapots.
As for the improvement of the suit,
don't ask me.
I'm not a specialist in this.
If you want to work on it,
go to the engineering class on the first floor
and discuss it with the expert.
Stop trying to copy me.
I can't understand what the All-Powerful meant.
Now I have to figure out how not to strain my arms.
If I have a hand support device,
I can handle it.
I have to train my body to use one for all.
And only after that I can create my own super technique.
You can't back down from the rest.
You have to be better.
I see.
You want to learn how to control your body in flight.
Yeah, I'll be much more mobile
and I'll be able to use the combat techniques that I was taught.
What did you come up with, Ida?
I want to reduce the consequences of reverse acceleration.
I'm going to the workshop to improve my engines.
Wow, it's Deku.
I didn't think I'd see you here.
Hey, Uraraka.
Deku, are you going to update your suit?
Oh, Uraraka.
Stop making things up.
Patience and work will change everything.
Teacher is a loader.
That's what Thomas Edison said himself.
Even if you didn't do it, do it again.
I'm wasting my time for good.
I'm not talking about that.
Can you at least listen to me once, Hatsume?
Wow, so you're that boy?
Sandra!
Please excuse me for the explosion.
How are you doing at the Hero School?
Oh, I forgot. How are you?
Midoriya Izuku.
Iida Tenya!
You used me at the festival to advertise your inventions.
I see.
Now I have to go back to my kids.
I'm here to improve my suit.
Can I ask your teacher to improve my suit?
Improve your suit, you say?
I'm at your disposal.
Hatsume, I don't mind you developing in my workshop.
But if you make a mess, I'll kick you out.
It's kind of...
Look, the head told me.
Are you here to improve your suit?
Come in.
Wow, it's a secret base.
First, let me instruct you.
The suits came on order, right?
I'm familiar with the technology of their creation,
so I can see and understand what can be added.
If the changes are small, I'll send them to the office
with a note on how to do it.
For big changes in the suit,
I'll have to send a document for confirmation
where it will have to go through all the checks.
Before I go back,
I'm working with one of the best agencies.
It'll take no more than three days.
I need to somehow reduce the load on my hands.
Is that even possible?
Midoriya, your main weapon is your hands, right?
In that case, strong changes will not be required.
Isn't that great, Deku?
Yes!
I see.
Hatsume, what are you doing?
Can't you see? I'm looking at his body.
Hey, your body is stronger than it looks.
I have something just for you.
My baby! Enhanced exoskeleton!
As if this high-tech baby is tracking your muscles
and helps you move them.
Baby number 49.
But I need support only for my hands.
Start!
Wow, he's moving by himself.
What? He's not stopping!
I don't want to go there! Stop!
Deku!
Stop!
I haven't calibrated the program yet.
Excuse me.
Are you okay?
I just wanted hand stabilizers,
but in the end it looks like I need it for the whole body.
But it's great for detaining villains.
I'd like to order cooling for my engines.
Oh, I have something for you.
Here you go, baby!
These are hand electric boosters with cooling system.
Baby number 36.
But I don't need hand boosters, Hatsume.
Besides...
Turn it on!
...the whole body is on my chest.
Yes!
My thing is just the legs.
I know.
But here's what I think.
If you want to cool your legs,
then use your hands!
That's some kind of madness!
Stop fooling around!
Stop trying to repeat after me.
Here it is.
Excuse me.
She really wants to help.
We understand.
Yeah.
But if you want to become heroes,
then you'd better be friends with her.
As soon as you become professionals,
she'll take care of you.
Look over there.
It's a pile of garbage.
It's all invented by Hatsume since she came here.
Even on weekends she comes here to help.
I've seen a lot of engineers all this time,
but Hatsume is special even among them.
It's not even been four months.
She's already done so much.
Einstein said,
the common sense is the sum of all your assumptions.
She's not afraid of failure
and keeps inventing something new time and time again.
They call such people inventors.
Stop trying to repeat after me.
What's that?
Your responsibility before the Almighty.
What's that?
It's hanging on you with candles.
What's that?
If you want to cool your legs,
then use your hands.
I've got an idea!
Ida!
Can you teach me something?
What do you want to know?
If you're talking about the costume,
then I haven't figured it out yet.
Oh, right.
Your face is burning.
What? Really?
By the way, Uraraka,
do you want to improve your costume too?
You need something that will help you deal with the thirst.
There you go.
What about this?
What's that?
Is it something explosive?
Please, try it.
There's something black there!
Hatsube!
I'm sorry.
The training of super techniques has continued.
4 DAYS LATER
What's up, Izawa?
You're here again.
They're slowly moving forward.
Midori!
Are you going to kill me?
I'm going to kill you!
I'm going to kill you!
I'm going to kill you!
I'm going to kill you!
I'm going to kill you!
I'm going to kill you!
Midori!
Did you change your costume?
Yeah, I ordered stabilizers on my hands.
You could have changed completely.
Your costume is too boring.
I like it.
Congratulations on your achievement!
I tried my best for you.
I want to keep the original image.
I want to keep the original image.
I want to keep the original image.
I want to keep the original image.
Cover me, Dark Shadow.
Cover me, Dark Shadow.
Stop!
Cover me, Dark Shadow.
I can get rid of my physical weaknesses.
I can get rid of my physical weaknesses.
I called it...
Black Death.
Not too clever.
It's important that your technique is easy to perform.
Got it!
Many have already decided on the style.
This one has already invented
several dozen techniques.
Instead of the explosion with the whole palm,
I'll focus the explosion in one spot.
Instead of the explosion with the whole palm,
I'll focus the explosion in one spot.
Armor-piercing shot!
Armor-piercing shot!
Ha-ha!
It worked!
Yudibakuga is ahead of the whole planet.
Yudibakuga is ahead of the whole planet.
Yeah.
Watch out!
Watch out!
Put out thunderclap!
P apartment!
P apartment!
P outiter!
The Almighty only used his fists.
P outier!
I got one of them.
I thought there was no other way.
And I got me.
And I got me.
It's so simple that I couldn't think of anything else.
If my hands don't work, I use my legs!
One for all! Full coverage!
Killing style!
Straight to the point!
Moving on.
