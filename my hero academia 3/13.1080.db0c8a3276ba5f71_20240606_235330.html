        <pre>The prestigious academic institution of the U.A. Academy.
After taking the Heroic course, I continue to pursue my dream.
To resist the difficulties and save people with a smile on their faces.
In order to become the greatest of the heroes!
I want to become the greatest of the heroes!
I want to become the greatest of the heroes!
I want to become the greatest of the heroes!
I want to become the greatest of the heroes!
I want to become the greatest of the heroes!
I want to become the greatest of the heroes!
I want to become the greatest of the heroes!
I want to become the greatest of heroes!
I want to become the greatest of heroes!
I want to become the greatest of heroes!
I want to become the greatest of heroes!
I want to become the greatest of heroes!
I want to become the greatest of heroes!
I want to become the greatest of heroes!
I want to become the greatest of heroes!
I want to become the greatest of heroes!
I want to become the greatest of heroes!
I want to become the greatest of heroes!
Let me pass on my knowledge to Isaac.
I will protect him and bring him to life.
Mom!
How can I agree to such a thing?
You are the one for whom the language lives.
You don't have to put your life on the line.
Please, live and defend it as best you can.
If you swear to me that, I will not stand in the way.
Mom!
I swear with all my heart.
To the language.
If you want to live like that in Yue, then...
I promise I will not give you a reason to worry.
Don't say that.
With such a face, I don't want to let you go.
But I didn't have time to look at her.
How the praised hero you are has become so high to call you back.
It must be the greatest joy for you.
Don't put your life on the line?
I understand why he grew up like that.
He has been with me for a long time, as no one has said.
You have a wonderful mother.
Yes.
A little bit like my teacher.
What? My mom?
Yes, maybe it's about the hairstyle.
Hairstyle?
And she is very strong.
Look, this guy is a walking skeleton.
And it's true.
I'm not used to walking on people like that.
It's so embarrassing.
Okay, see you at school.
Yeah.
After mom gave me permission, I left home and started a new life.
In just five minutes of walking from the UA Academy,
the construction company completed the construction of the dormitory in three days.
It will be mine.
Not ours.
A new house.
The decision to run the dormitory system was made for everyone.
The threat is still great, and the new system will help track down the traitors.
It's time to deal with this anxiety that hangs on the walls of this academy.
And besides, we will avoid public investigation and take care of everything ourselves.
Unfortunately, I will have to doubt the trust of teachers and students,
but I am the director and I have no choice.
We have lost the symbol of the world.
Even though this blow is not soon,
we will be able to recover.
And we will put all our strength into recovery.
At least we will help the students do it and create a bright future for them.
First, Class 1A.
I'm glad you're all well.
Looks like everyone got permission.
I had to make a fuss.
That's okay.
I'm glad you're a teacher too.
I thought that after that conference, your career would come to an end.
Yeah.
I'm surprised that everything went well, but a lot of water has already flowed.
They left us alone until they dug up more,
so as not to be thrown away without evidence.
So, now I will explain to you the rules of our dormitory.
The plan of the summer camp was to give you temporary hero licenses at the end.
Exactly, he was talking about it.
I already had time to forget.
Listen carefully, this is important.
Kirishima, Yohirozu, Todoroki, Midoriya, Iida.
It was you five who decided to leave the dormitory.
Your reaction confirms my words.
But that closed my eyes.
But here's what I'm going to say.
If it wasn't for the All-Mighty,
I would have excluded the whole class for the exclusion of Bakugo, Jiro, and Hagakura.
If it wasn't for the All-Mighty,
I would have excluded the whole class for the exclusion of Bakugo, Jiro, and Hagakura.
If it wasn't for the All-Mighty,
I would have excluded the whole class for the exclusion of Bakugo, Jiro, and Hagakura.
For the main five, the reason is clear.
And as for the rest,
they didn't even try to stop their comrades.
There is no excuse for this.
You betrayed our trust.
What would you do if they were killed?
That's all.
Now go inside.
It's not after this.
Come here.
What?
No, I don't want to.
Hurray!
What is Bakugo doing there?
Kirishima.
What?
What? Money? You're scaring me.
Just take them.
Did you spend all the money on this?
Yes, but how did you know that I bought the Night Vision glasses?
What's the difference?
It was very simple, if you're interested.
Just stay the same moron.
Don't make me laugh, Kaminaria.
I can't stop.
Sorry.
Now you need to relax a little.
I'm sorry, but my mother won't fix anything.
I treat everyone to yaki-oki on my account.
Are you kidding me?
Hurray!
One class is held at each dormitory.
Girls in the right wing, boys in the left.
The first floor is common for everyone.
There will be a dining room, a laundry room and a bath.
There is even an indoor yard.
It's spacious, beautiful and there are sofas.
This is a mansion.
Hurray!
I didn't hear you.
Baths and laundry rooms are common.
Am I sleeping?
They are divided.
Take your time.
Yes.
The rooms start from the second floor.
There are four rooms on each floor.
From each side to the fifth floor.
Each will have its own room.
Each has an air conditioner, a table, a bed, a wardrobe and a refrigerator.
Even the balcony is great.
The wardrobe is as spacious as the house.
It's definitely a mansion.
Hurray!
These are your rooms.
All your things have already been delivered.
Your task for today is to stay in them.
We'll talk about everything else tomorrow.
That's all.
Go away.
Okay, teacher!
Oh, I'm tired.
Kirishima, have you already laid out the things?
Yes, finished.
Well done.
I wonder how we will live together.
Yeah.
Live together.
Together to train the team spirit and discipline.
Give up all your strength for this, Shida.
Well, the boys settled down?
Yes, now we are resting.
And we thought about it with the girls.
And we got an offer.
Let's arrange a room show.
No, no, no, no, no, no, wait!
Midoriya.
A true fan of the Almighty.
Otaku Palace.
Well, yes, I'm a fan.
How shameful, damn it!
Damn it.
What did we get ourselves into?
But you know, it's even fun.
Takayami.
What a stupidity.
It's dark and scary.
Bastards.
I bought these earrings at a middle school.
And you like boys like that?
Get out.
A sword.
What a charm.
Get out, I said.
Aoyama.
Too bright.
No, no, not bright.
Blinding.
Well, in principle, we thought so.
I'm not even surprised.
It's a lot of fun.
There's one room left on the second floor.
Come in.
I'll show you something amazing.
Let's go to the third floor.
Here, here.
Ujuro.
Wow, that's too normal.
Too normal, wow.
Not true, the most ordinary room.
Do not torture yourself with the search for compliments.
Ida.
A lot of wise books.
A real old man.
Everything is like normal people.
A whole shelf of glasses.
What's so strange about that?
This is a case if the old ones break during training.
Kaminaria.
Everything in a row.
I dragged everything into the room that my hands reached.
What? Isn't that great?
Koda.
The rabbit is so cute.
Cute.
I dragged the animal into the room.
Koda, you're a cheater.
It seems that the spirit of rivalry has awakened in everyone.
I don't like it.
I think so too.
I agree.
Me too.
Don't you think it's strange that only the boys had to listen to the critic in their address?
This is our competition, right?
And how do we determine the winner if we didn't look at the girls' rooms?
Aren't you afraid to blind us with your design and sense of style?
In response to the girls' challenge, the boys were inspired by the fighting spirit.
Sounds good.
What?
And in the competition for the best sense of style, everyone took part in Class 1A.
The final match is about to begin.
Are you sure? Are you sure about that?
It's been voiced specially for the Jam Club.
The site of the VK group is vk.com.slash.jamfans.
So, we decide once and for all today who is the king of the room.
The king?
You don't have to call it that.
Let's go.
You don't have to call it that.
If I were alone, the girls would beat me right away.
But I managed to catch the pride of the boys.
I was able to make the perfect plan for penetration.
And now I can legally watch every corner of the girls' rooms.
I want to sleep.
I want to sleep.
Here we have Bakugo, Kirishima and Shoji.
Where's Bakugo?
He said it was stupid and he'd better go to sleep.
I want to sleep too.
Then let's go see Kirishima's room.
Let's see.
I don't think the girls will like my room.
It's so manly!
Yeah.
This room is leading the list of rooms.
Wherever I want to find a guy.
It's a fire!
It's like an oak!
That's what I'm talking about.
Next, Shoji!
There's nothing interesting here.
It's empty.
Nothing interesting?
Are you a minimalist?
I've never been interested in material values.
According to statistics, such rooms like perverts.
Next, the fifth floor of the boys' room.
The first one, Seru!
Are you really going to look at every room?
Wow!
Asia!
Beautiful!
I didn't think you liked it so much, Seru.
Judging by the cover, Seru!
Next, next!
The next Todoroki, right?
The best student in the class.
The main handsome boy in the class.
From the anticipation of watching the Todoroki room, my heart beat faster.
Let's go faster, I want to sleep.
Japanese style!
How did you build it?
We have a traditional house.
So it's hard for me without it.
I don't care about the reason!
How did you manage to rebuild in one day?
I tried.
What's wrong with him?
He will definitely grow up to be a big bump.
Handsome boys don't have everything like people.
The next guy is the last.
Me.
A simple boring room.
Any room is boring after Todoroki.
And it smells delicious.
What is it?
Oh, damn it, I forgot!
I unpacked and forgot to cook.
I thought I'd treat you all.
It would be even more delicious with cream.
Will you?
Yes!
Even he has something to cling to girls!
How delicious and airy!
I am more surprised than in the case of Sarah.
Yeah.
What a wonderful hobby you have, Sato.
Come over to me for tea with your cake.
I didn't think everyone would be so happy.
I got carried away with this purely because of my pritches.
I was just thinking about training, that's all.
We're done with the boys.
We really want to see all the rooms.
Is that okay?
Yeah, that's great!
There are even more instruments than I thought!
Jiro Rockersh, whatever.
Can you play something?
Yeah, I'm still studying.
It doesn't look like a girl's room.
You're not worth it, lady!
Moving on.
The next one is me, Hagakure!
Well, what do you think?
Wow.
A typical room for girls.
I like it.
I like it.
I like it.
I like it.
Wow.
A typical room for girls.
Plus Ultra.
Don't you dare do your perversion here, Mineta!
I'm the next one!
Ta-da!
It's cute, isn't it?
Wow.
Uraraka.
Not the most interesting room.
Wow.
I feel like going and looking at everyone is okay.
The forbidden gardens.
The next one is Asui.
Well, Tsui isn't here.
Tsui said she's not feeling well.
Well, there's nothing to do.
Let's see how she makes her room easier.
The last one, Yauya Rose.
I've been trying too hard with my room.
I've been trying too hard with my room.
I've been trying too hard with my room.
Your rooms are all so original.
Mine is a little tight.
This bed is just a titan.
And you can't take a step.
This is my ordinary furniture.
I didn't think the room would be so small.
Yeah, we get that you're a princess.
So, guys.
Everyone voted.
And you can't vote for yourself.
So, the first king of the room, except for Bakugai Tsu, is...
With a big cut, six votes goes to...
Sato Rikido.
What?
All the votes were for the girls.
Because that cake is delicious.
And what about the room?
Oh, you're small.
You're destroying our heroines.
It's not like that.
Let me cry for happiness.
Are you done?
I'm going to sleep.
Of course.
Go and brush your teeth after the cake.
I've had it to the end.
Oh, Todoroki, wait.
And also Deku, Kirishima, Ida and Yauya Rose.
Uraraka, where are we going?
I don't know.
Tsuwa wants to talk to you.
I always say what I think.
But sometimes I don't know what to say.
Remember what I said in the hospital?
If you break the rules,
then what are you different from the villains?
Yes, I remember.
I whispered hurtful words.
Tsuwa.
But you still went.
And when I found out about it,
I was shocked.
Too many thoughts were spinning in my head.
I didn't know what to do.
I don't have the strength to talk to you.
But...
it made me very upset.
I still didn't accept this
and wanted to tell you.
To have fun with you again,
as before.
And this worries not only you, Tsuwa.
We all had a stone in our hearts.
That's why
this whole game with the king was arranged
to have fun with Deku and the others.
We wanted to say that we are innocent.
I mean, I don't know how to say it.
Let's have fun together and move forward.
Tsuwa!
I'm so sorry.
Thank you for talking to us.
Tsuwa!
Tsuwa, forgive us.
Tsuwa!
We won't do it again.
Me too.
I swear.
That's right.
We all had a stone in our hearts.
But we wanted to get rid of it.
And we returned everything like in the good old days,
when we all wanted to become heroes together.
Let's move on.
