The prestigious academic institution of the U.A. academy.
After taking the Heroic course, I continued to pursue my dream.
To resist the difficulties and save people with a smile on their faces.

Almighty has said.
You can not save everyone.
You just have to save the ones you can reach.
But I... I was right next to him.
But I couldn't save him.
What was my trick for then?
My body... I couldn't move.
I had enough strength to save Koto.
I couldn't save anyone else.
Then let's go and save him.
Let the professionals do it.
We don't have a place there, idiots.
We know that.
But we can't do anything about it.
We knew he was being hunted.
And we couldn't do anything about it.
If I don't do anything now...
If I don't do anything now...
Then how can I call myself a hero?
Listen, Midoriya, you can still reach him.
We can save him.
Chapter 3
So we take the tracking device...
We take the tracking device...
And we go where it shows us?
And we go where it shows us?
Yes.
Despite the fact that they didn't kill Bakugo and kidnap him,
he's still in great danger.
If they save his life,
then considering his character, it won't be long.
I'll help Kirishimi do this.
Stop even thinking about it!
Calm down.
Kirishimi is disappointed that he couldn't do anything.
And Todoroki isn't disappointed that Bakugo was kidnapped right in front of him.
I know what it's like.
But you can't make such decisions only on emotions.
Isn't that right?
Let the Almighty do this.
And we don't have permission to conduct combat operations
from Aizawa's teacher.
Uyama is right.
Of course, I don't have the right to say that.
After all, I was saved myself.
Guys, we're all shocked by Bakugo's kidnapping.
Guys, we're all shocked by Bakugo's kidnapping.
But we need to think it over calmly.
It doesn't matter what you feel.
If you go into battle again,
If you go into battle again,
you'll break the law.
And you'll be no better than the villains.
I'm sorry to interrupt.
Midori, it's time for the exam.
Midori, it's time for the exam.
Well, then let's go.
We still need to visit Jiro and Hagakure.
Right.
Deco, get well soon.
Yeah.
Thank you, guys.
I talked to Yoruya yesterday.

If you're with us, we're moving out today.
I don't know how serious your wounds are.

But I'm asking you.
Because you're worried about this more than any of us.

We'll be waiting for you at the hospital exit in the evening.

While you were sleeping,
a healing girl was doing your treatment.
And you can move your hands again.

But it's not that simple.
You got a lot of injuries

And this time, they turned out to be much more serious.

I asked for your medical card and found out something.

Every time the same thing is repeated.
Your hands explode from the inside like a firework.
And your case is especially serious.

Usually, a person does not put more than 80%

For example, in dangerous and extreme situations.

Judging by our observations,
you have big problems.
Here, look at this.
You have big problems.
Not only the muscles and bones suffer,
but also your ligaments.
The ligaments protect the joints,
and they are in great danger.
Simply put,
if this repeats a few more times,
then you will have to get used to
with an ambulance flying over both hands.

And then you will need rehabilitation.
Believe me, it will be very painful.

I'll get you out of here, and then
UAE will take care of you.
UAE will take care of you.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
I'm sorry for causing you so much trouble.
The healing girl was angry at you.
You probably have already heard
from her in the past.
However, the most important thing is that you saved someone's life.
However, the most important thing is that you saved someone's life.
In a healthy body, a healthy spirit.
Just keep moving forward.
Midori,
I'm sorry I behaved like that.
Thank you for saving me,
even though I'm a stranger to you.
Get well soon.
I want to thank you personally.
Kota.
Kota.
Mom?
Yes, I was fired.
But I have to do something,
I'm going home only tomorrow.
Yes, I can walk.
Yes, I can walk.
But I feel very sluggish.
I've been lured well.

Izuku,
you must return to UAE.

Storatel,
you have a call.
Who is it?
Officer Tsukauchi from the police.
I'm listening.
We would like to ask for your help, Storatel.

I want you to remember something.

Even if I'm not here,

Like a pair of new jeans.
Keep patrolling the streets.
Yes, sir! Best jeans!
Hero number 5, Storatel.

Grant Arinov.
Wild, wild cats, Tiger.
Wooden Kamui,
Mountain Lady.
Do you want me to help?
Do you want me to help?
Yes, please.
You understand why we need your help, don't you?
You understand why we need your help, don't you?
I need to think about it.
I need to think about it.
Yui Rose said she would think about it.
In any case,
it all depends on her decision.
She's coming.
Midoriya.
Yui Rose, what do you say?
I...
Stop!
Ida?
Ida.
But why?
Why are you doing this?
Why are you doing this?
It was you who stopped the train.
It was you who stopped me
from doing something unthinkable.
You two risked your lives for me to think about it.
Why are you going to repeat my mistake?
Why are you going to repeat my mistake?
That's too much.
What are you talking about?
We're still children.
We're still children.
Yui is already in a terrible state.
Tell me, who's going to take responsibility for you?
Tell me, who's going to take responsibility for you?
Don't you understand?
Ida, it's not like that. We're not going to break the rules.
You think I don't care?
You think I don't care?
I'm worried about more than anyone else.
After all, I'm your boss.
Worrying about you is my responsibility.
And Bakugo in particular.
Every time you back down
you get serious injuries.
I've seen how it all ends.
You think I don't care what's going on with you?
You think I don't care what's going on with you?
You want to say I don't care about your worries?
You want to say I don't care about your worries?
Ida!
Don't say you don't understand what I'm feeling right now.
Don't say you don't understand what I'm feeling right now.
Don't say you don't understand what I'm feeling right now.
Ida.
Ida.
We're not going to break the rules
and fight them.
We're going to save him
without getting into a fight.
It's a secret operation.
That way we can save him
without breaking the rules.
I trust you, Todoroki.
I want to help you
if something unexpected happens.
I want to help you
if something unexpected happens.
Yaoirozu!
Yaoirozu!
I...
I'm against this idea myself.
But as long as I can reach him
I can't stop thinking about it.
I can't stop thinking about it.
Thinking about what I want to save him.
Thinking about what I want to save him.
Each of the best heroes
once was a student.
And each of them
repeats the same phrase
at the beginning of their careers.
My body moved by itself
and I didn't think about the consequences.
So you're not going to change your mind.
Then I'm coming with you.
Do you remember the attack
in the U.A. park?
Then I said it would
repeat itself again.
Today the best of you are going to gather here.
It's time to discuss our plan.
I'll ask you one more time.
You're not a hero, Bakugou Katsuki.
Do you want to become
one of us?
I'd rather die in a dirty ditch.
An important event
begins.
It's made specially for Gym Club.
The site of the group is vk.com
vk.com slash gymfans
Midoriya
I shouldn't have hit you.
I'm sorry.
Leave it, Ida.
It sounds like
we're forcing you.
It's okay, I'm not angry at you.
I'll go with you
even though I don't agree with your decision.
If there's even a hint of a fight
I'll get you out of there
immediately.
I'll keep an eye on you.
That's right, I'll be watchful.
Watchful Ida.
It's about me too.
Bakugou, let the pros save you.
Our interference will not benefit anyone.
That's why I came up with a
good plan.
And you'd better not forget about it.
Yeah, I understand.
Save him without a fight
is unreal.
I'm afraid they don't understand
what they're going for.
I hope when they see everything
they'll understand
how impossible their task is.
The coordinates point
to the Kamina district in Yokogama
in the prefecture of Kanagawa.
We're leaving Nagano
and we'll be there in two hours.
Exactly at 22.00.
Did you tell anyone else
about the details of our plan?
Yeah, the other guys
didn't take it very well
and wanted to stop us.
Uraraka was more careful than the others.
Bakugou will take it as an insult
if you save him.
That's right.
Don't come any closer, Deku.
I'll tell you what I think.
What we're doing
just for our egoism
nobody's going to praise us for it.
If you want, you can still refuse.
I'm not going to doubt it.
I'm sure even now
it gives them resistance.
What do you say, Midoriya?
Me?
You're going to get into other people's problems.
That's one of the main qualities of a hero.
Mom...
I owe everything to the Almighty.
And since the Almighty
saw me as a hero
I'm not going to back down.
I see.
I see.
We're in Kamino.
That's a lot of people.
Are they hiding somewhere here?
Where are they, Yao and Rose?
Wait a minute!
We have to be very careful.
The villains know who we are.
Did you forget?
They can attack us at any moment.
I see.
We have to hide.
If we hide, we won't find anything, Midoriya.
But we won't find anyone
at this pace.
Damn, what do we do?
I have an idea.
What?
Hey!
What do you want?
So the disguise...
That's right.
What kind of clothes are these?
I'll talk to you later.
Hey, what do you want?
That's nothing.
Move your jaw out more.
Hey!
That's right.
Our girl has a buffer that she needs.
Great!
Childish tricks
would stand out in the night city.
Yao and Rose,
why didn't you create your own clothes?
That's a violation of the rules!
If I did that,
the store would have collapsed.
That's a lie!
Yes, I'm a hero and I have to support society
and our economy.
I see.
I could just say
I wanted to go shopping.
Guys, this way.
Wow, they're from UAE!
What?
So we're starting the broadcast
from the press conference of UAE,
which has just begun.
Teacher Aizawa
and the director too.
Due to the incompetence
on our part,
27 of our students
suffered in some way or another.
We were preparing our students
for extreme situations,
but were unable to provide
decent protection from attacks from outside.
We bring you the deepest apologies.
Teacher Aizawa hates television.
A question from the YumiRu TV channel.
It's the beginning of the year
and this is the fourth time
we've had to face the villains.
This time they were seriously injured.
Will you say something to the families of the victims?
What measures will you take in the future?
After the sports festival,
UAE has already taken
their position on this issue.
Why repeat it?
As if it's their fault.
We took protection measures
as well as
provided all kinds of attacks.
We've strengthened student protection
several times.
That's our position.
What? What are they talking about?
They can't protect anyone.
The school is heroic,
but they can't handle the villains.
How many more people will suffer?
They only think about themselves.
It's sad that UAE
demands results.
The atmosphere around us has become
worse and worse.
Isn't it strange?
Why are they blaming
the heroes?
It's not their fault
that they stepped back a couple of times.
But their job is to protect people.
After all, we are all people
and we have the right to make mistakes.
And people demand
unauthorized work from them.
The heroes are on a short leash.
What can you say about that, Bakuga?
The day when they started
demanding money,
they stopped being heroes.
That's what the spot taught us.
Two-person people
who live for money and fame
and a society
that imposes its own rules.
People criticize
those who lost
instead of supporting them.
I have a question.
What is a hero?
What is justice?
Is there justice
in this society at all?
We want you to ask yourself
this question.
And after that, we will win.
You like to win, don't you?
Dabi,
free him.
What? He's going to fight right away.
It's okay.
We have to treat him like an equal
and get to know him better.
He's not a fool to try to kill all of us.
You understand that,
don't you?
Kyohei,
Twice, free him.
What? Me? No way!
Free him, as you say.
We're sorry that we had to
force you,
but I hope you understand
that we're not a gang of thugs.
Your kidnapping
is not an easy thing.
Each of us has an important reason
to follow this path.
The rules or the heroes.
And you have to understand us.
Shigaraki!
I honestly tried to
listen to you,
but you were constantly
talking some kind of smelly nonsense.
You're talking about something like
we were offended by people,
help us to avenge them.
We thought it would work.
Oh, he's against the four of them!
Do you think he'll lose?
The All-Mighty is so cool!
He doesn't care who's against him.
He always wins!
I want the same fame
as the All-Mighty.
And I don't care what you say.
I've already
chosen my path.
That's it.
Let's move on.
