        <pre>I used everything I had.
You are the next.
You are the next.
You are the next.
Let's open our eyes
Oh
Dreamin'
One, two, three, four
A square sky
The gap in our hearts
It's filling up
The night is opening up
Let's get through it
The future is opening up
Let's open our eyes
There's nothing I want to become
The days I've been lying to
I keep my ideals
Let's live
Not just
Love and dreams
Even if it's strange
It's easy to notice
Let's get through it
Let's get through it
Let's get through it
The captured Nomu is no different from the previous ones
There's no reaction from them
And we're unlikely to get new information from them
The warehouse where they were produced was destroyed
It's very difficult to understand the technology and production of the wreckage
You've already started collecting data on the Hezbar criminals
The investigation is not over yet
Even though we detained their leader
The group headed by Shigaraki managed to escape
It may sound a little naive
But you can consider it as a draw
Idiot!
We've lost the symbol of the world
Weak form, the Almighty has opened up to the world
We no longer have the symbol of the world that will never fall
Both for civilians and for criminals
It would be a mistake to throw all responsibility on one person
The world has seen what a group of crazy people can do if they want to
And it scares me
According to the initial information
Their leader Shigaraki Tomura is the character of an unstable child
The more people Shigaraki has, the more insane his plans become
The danger lies in the fact that he does all this on display
He thinks and develops
With the fall of the Almighty, nothing holds them back
And every day under his wing there will be more and more people
With each time their league is getting stronger
They got great conditions for growth
Which were not there before
Do you think everything went according to their plan?
Don't you think you're making things up?
Maybe
One thing I know for sure
We must tie them as quickly as possible
We are the police
And we can no longer wait until the criminals are caught by the heroes
It's time to change a lot
The last spark of the flame has gone out
There are no more symbols of the world
However
I haven't finished my job yet
Shigaraki Tomura
So the grandson of Shimura
But these are just words for one
Can you believe them?
Did any of you connect with the Shimura family?
No
Why?
Shimura's husband was killed
And she gave her son to the foster family
To get him away from the world of heroes
She told Toshinori not to connect with her child
No matter what happened to her
And keeping the promise, that's what happened
Bad thing
She just wanted to bring peace away from her connections
I have to find Shigaraki
Find
No way
What can you do?
No matter who he was, he's already on the dark path
He's a criminal
It will be a mistake to count backwards when meeting him
From this moment on, I will be looking for Shigaraki
Tsukauchi
You stay in Yoya and you will fulfill your main duty
Let you no longer be a symbol of the world
But the Almighty is still alive
After all, we met Todoroki and the others
And took Kachan to the police
Kachan was surprisingly silent
Half a day later, we went home
We followed Yeji
Welcome back
There's some kind of madness going on around
You went to visit Mom, but you didn't answer my messages
And I was worried
I'm sorry, sister
He suddenly came back, all nervous
If the Almighty can no longer fight
Hero number one will be
But not like this
I can not accept this
I will not accept this
Never in my life
Welcome back
The Almighty probably had a hard time
It's not easy for you either, Izuku
Yes
What will happen now?
Did we do the right thing?
The Almighty
The Almighty
Wait, dinner is almost ready
I'm coming
The Almighty
Oh, finally here
The Almighty
Why are you so long?
The Almighty
The Almighty
Is it so difficult for you to do what you are told?
You could have been killed
What kind of lunatic do I have a successor?
Midoriya, my boy
I
That is, my time has passed
My body is no longer capable of anything
One fire for all
Finally extinguished in me
And I can no longer maintain my true form
Why do you continue to climb into the very hell?
Why do you continue to destroy your body?
But this time you surpassed yourself
You got out of danger completely harmless
I'm so happy for this
From this moment I will give more time to your development
No matter how difficult it is, we will cope
The Almighty
It's hard for you to listen to others
How much more do I have to say for you to stop crying?
This is a strong chest pain
It made me understand that the era of the Almighty has come to an end
Thank you Almighty
You sacrificed yourself so many times for the sake of others
As a citizen, a hero and a director, I do not have enough opportunities to thank you
However, in the eyes of the public, you do not look in the best light
Since the moment the Almighty came to the UAE, all our problems have begun
Without his strength, he is no longer able to protect his children
The world has gone crazy
Therefore, we all must become stronger
And strengthen the ideals created by you
However, there is still a threat
We must ensure the safety of our students as never before
It's time to implement the long-developed plan I have developed
We will need to convince their families
Oh, how strange
Let it all work out
However, it is obvious that your system is limping on both legs
My night was wounded
Everything you say is correct
We have been blinded by the pride of Sitgeslav
And now we have realized our mistakes
And we are ready to put the danger to the minimum
Trust us in protecting your daughter
Eskioka will become a great hero
Oh, teacher, you don't have to bow so low
We made a decision as soon as we received a notification
After the battle of the Almighty, my father did not stop yelling
My daughter is learning from such a cool guy
She will shine brighter than Brain the Sun
He yelled without stopping
Eskioka, stop it
I'm trying to build a strict father for myself here
Shut up already
Come on, stop yelling
This is not a concert for you
I thought there would be a lot more curses
Let's drink if you don't mind
I think it's too much
I will not drink in front of our next family
It won't be so smooth
Of course, take this asshole
Stop hitting me, old woman, I'll kill you
Shut up, snot
Because you are so weak
You were able to grab some frosts
Enough already, please
You can't behave like this in front of teachers
Shut up, old man, it doesn't concern you at all
I said shut your mouth, Katsuki
If you open your mouth, speak humanly
This family has been blinded by darkness
So you agree with the proposal?
What?
Well, if you go to the dormitory, it will be much better for him
Katsuki doesn't always think about what he's doing
But he got such a powerful miracle
As a result, he was greatly spoiled, so he grew up like this
He was always praised only for his intelligence and magic
That's why I was pleased with your words in the interview
Nobody wants to be the best hero more than him
If the villains saw Bakug's weakness in this
Then they will have to realize how much they were wrong
I thought it was great that the Katsuki in this academy understand so well
I was very worried when he was kidnapped
But the main thing is that he is fine after all this
Maybe he looks like an evil asshole
But we hope that you will be able to educate him
Right?
Please do everything possible
So that he can become a hero, what he dreams himself
In general, I treat
So the next Midoriya just lives nearby
All-powerful
What?
You
Next
Tell me, who do you think Deku is?
A student
I see a strong hero in him, just like you
I'm sorry, Bakug, my boy
I can't tell you the truth
Hey, Katsuki, the police forbade you to leave the house
I see
Apparently for some reason you can't tell the truth
Thank you for the answer
Katsuki
I know
Are you sure you can handle it yourself?
Yes, otherwise we won't have time to go around all the families
I wouldn't want to miss dinner
Midoriya
Please come in
Excuse me
All-powerful in our house
Mom, calm down
Yes, I'm sure you were notified in advance
But I would like to talk about the transfer of students to UAE
By the way, about this
I'm against
Mom
Yesterday you agreed
I thought well and decided that it was bad
Izuku's miracle came at the wrong time
But he wanted to be like you
But she appeared and he immediately entered the UAE
And because of this, Izuku gets more and more injuries
You understand in what condition his hands are
He risks losing his hands completely
I watched your battle on TV
As a citizen, I am immensely grateful to you
But as a parent, I'm afraid
Izuku is equal to you
If such a fate awaits Izuku on the path of the hero
Help!
Now I'm here!
I...
Forgive me, Izuku
Forgive me
I...
If my child did not have a miracle
And only watched the heroic deeds
Maybe he would be happier
These thoughts do not leave me
Mom!
Izuku
I said I would always support you in everything
You want to go to the UAE, right?
But...
Forgive me, Izuku
If this continues, then my work will turn into nothing
I will speak frankly
As Izuku's mother
Seeing what is happening in the UAE
I can not trust you with my son
I know you are an amazing hero
But I will not change my opinion
Until the villains attack
You will not be able to conduct classes
You can not protect students from injuries
I can not afford my son
To study in such a place
I...
Madam
You're wrong, mom!
My injuries are my fault!
I was warned about this
But I did not listen to them
You do not even listen to them
How can they bear the responsibility for you?
My boy, sit down
You can call me an evil mom
But I'm ready to become one
I do not want to take the dream away from Izuku
Heroes are taught not only in your academy
The UAE is not the only such academy
Izuku!
His soul suffers
You were equal to me
You wanted to be like me
And you wanted to teach me
And you wanted to learn where I am
In the UAE
It is difficult when you are deprived of this
I'm sorry, I'll bring him
Well, let it be not the UAE
Look, mom
All-powerful
I got a letter
From the boy who was rescued in the camp
The boy who hated heroes and miracles
Thank me
I understand that I make you worry about yourself
But from this moment
When you are thanked from the bottom of my heart as a hero
I am immensely happy
I see
Let it be not the UAE
I will still become a hero
Are you ready?
You are no longer the one who follows my footsteps
As your teacher
I must support you
On your difficult path
I apologize for not fulfilling my obligations
But I believe that Izuku will become a worthy successor
I believe with all my heart that he will become a new symbol of the world
What?
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
I apologize
As a former symbol of the world
As a teacher, I was very weak
I have no forgiveness
I humbly pray for you
As a teacher, yo
It is true that this path will not be completed without blood and pain
But this path must be passed
And I will help him pass this path
All-powerful
He is such a cool hero
Can I become the same?
It is difficult to call the UAE a safe place, I agree
But all teachers, without giving up, are working hard to fix it
We are working on it
I pray for you to look not at what is, but at what will be
Let me pass my knowledge to Izuku
I will protect and raise him at the cost of my life
Mom?
How can I agree to this?
You are the one for whom Izuku lives
I do not hate the UAE
I want Izuku to be happy
You do not have to put your life on the line
Please live and protect him as best you can
If you swear to me in this
I will not stand in the way
Mom?
I swear to all seven
I swear to all hearts
Izuku
If you want to live in the UAE
Then
I promise I will not give an excuse to worry
Teacher
Take care of my son
Thank you very much
We will hear from those read by Jem
Thank you very much
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
I hate it
I do not want to regret
I'll tell you now
I love, I love, I love, I love
I love this place
A special prison for the villains Tartar
I lost, All-Powerful
I feel sorry for you as never before.
But I'm afraid you made a mistake.
You chose the path that will bring you closer to your students.
You missed your chance to leave.
You missed your chance to die beautifully.
The teacher's job is to help the student become independent.
If the student constantly relies on his teacher,
he cannot become stronger.
And he will never be on the path of a real leader.
He needs partners.
He learned to increase their number.
Everything will be fine with you, Shigaraki Tomura.
Get experience.
Hate.
Act.
Move forward.
You're next.
In the next episode, welcome to the dormitory.
Go beyond.
Plus Ultra.
