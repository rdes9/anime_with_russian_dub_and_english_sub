        <pre>The prestigious educational institution in which young heroes are taught is the U.A. Academy.
To resist the difficulties and save people with a smile.
To become the greatest of the heroes.
To become the greatest of the heroes.
To become the greatest of the heroes.
To become the greatest of the heroes.
To become the greatest of the heroes.
Kachan and Todoroki came second on the courage test.
If they didn't turn anywhere, they should be nearby.
A-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a
Shodji!
You're a zero, how did you get here?
Apparently you want to save everyone with all your heart.
What can you do about it?
It's...
Just don't tell me!
Yes.
If you want to keep running, you'll have to calm him down first.
Get out of my way or you'll die!
Takayami?
Screaming Turn
What's going on here, Shoji?
Be quiet.
After we got the message from the mandal,
not to fight the villains,
we began to move more carefully.
But at one point, the villain attacked us.
Shoji!
I tried to cover Takayami,
but in the process I lost my hand.
Hand?
In fact, the wound is not serious.
I can grow a new one.
My replicants can copy themselves.
The cut off hand was just a copy.
But...
Apparently, this event took him out of himself.
The miracle that he held for so long came out of his control.
In the dark, he can't control it.
I didn't think his miracle was so scary.
In addition, the feeling of guilt and indignation press on him,
which makes it even wilder
and now won't get close to him.
He attacks everything that makes a sound,
whether it's a friend or an enemy.
Don't worry about me!
Go to the others!
And save them!
Calm down, Dark Shadow!
Dark Shadow is afraid of light.
If we lure him to the camp,
we can calm him down.
Midoriya!
I don't care what happens to me.
I'm not going to leave my friend in trouble.
You're worried about your friend Bakugo too,
since you came here with such wounds.
If you can still move,
I'll distract Dark Shadow and let you go.
Wait!
The camp is too far away.
It will be very dangerous.
I know.
Saving yourself is a risk.
That's why they call us heroes.
Choose.
Will you stay and help Tokoyami?
Or will you run and help Bakugo?
What will you choose, Midoriya?
I'm sorry.
Shoji.
Blood!
Fresh meat!
Blood!
I can't get to him.
Damn it.
All I have to do is blow him up.
No.
You think I'll plant some trees.
Cover it with ice and that's it.
The explosion will block our view.
If you don't come out, what will you do then?
His advantage in range and attack speed.
It's them.
I see ice.
They're already fighting.
What?
Bakugo!
Todoroki!
I'm asking any of you to create light!
Blood!
I'm sorry.
Shoji.
I have a stupid idea.
What?
If the shadow reacts to sound,
then make a bait with your replicants.
What?
Then we'll run to Kachan
and he'll create light with his explosions.
If you choose who to save,
then I choose both of them.
Kachan!
Shoji and Midoriya?
And behind them...
Takayami?
Hurry up and create light!
Takayami's blown up!
Kachan!
Kachan!
Kachan!
Kachan!
Takayami's blown up!
He attacks without a fight?
Okay, my flame.
Stop, idiot!
Blood...
Fresh meat...
Bad...
I won't share it with anyone.
I'll eat these children.
Don't take them from me!
Don't you dare!
Don't you dare point out to me...
...a trifle.
Watch.
Watch.
I'm not done yet.
Your trifle is nothing compared to mine.
I'm sorry.
What brought you here?
At one point, you were a villain
that we couldn't handle.
Takayami, how are you?
Are you okay?
It's good that I listened to him.
Takayami, don't resist!
Don't touch me!
Give yourself to the dark shadow!
Leave me alone!
I'm sorry, Shoji.
It was my fault.
And you too, Midoriya.
It's all my fault.
My heart was not ready for this.
The influence of the darkness and my anger
underlined my trick.
I let my rage take over me
when Shoji's hand was cut off.
You'll share your experiences later.
In our place, you would say the same.
That's right.
We found out that Kachan is one of the villains' targets.
Bakugo?
They want to kill him?
But why?
I don't know.
In any case, we need to take him to a safe place.
With the prof, the teachers of Maezawa and Vlad are calmer.
I understand.
Our mission is to escort Bakugo.
The cats are still fighting the enemy on the site.
Let's go along the way and see the villain.
It's better to go through the forest directly.
We don't know how many villains there are.
There's always a chance to meet them.
We're using Shoji's ability to scan the area.
And plus your ice.
Data-kayami is very useful when he controls his shadow.
In such a team, we are not even afraid of the Almighty.
What the hell is going on here?
Go to the center and be silent.
Don't defend me, you idiots!
Let's go.
Did you hear me?
The main thing is not to lag behind.
I know it myself!
To return everyone to their original state.
That's the only way we're going to win.
Sounded specifically for the Gym Club.
The set of the VK.com VK.com set for GymFans.
Five minutes earlier.
Ochako, is your hand okay?
Yeah, it's just a scratch.
That's right.
There's not enough blood.
Don't you think it's bad to cut people?
Who are you?
I'm Toga.
And you are my cuties.
Uraraka and Asui.
She knows our names.
This is all a sports festival.
She always knew that popularity would put us in an awkward position.
Very little blood.
I usually drink it in cups, and then I have to suck it out through a straw.
I just need to pierce you with this device.
Then I'll get as much blood as I need.
Get ready, in general.
Ochako!
Run to the camp!
We were allowed to fight, but only for the sake of protection.
That's what the teacher Aizawa meant.
Tsuya, you run too.
I'll go straight for...
Tsuya...
Tsuya...
Tsuya...
What?
What a cute name.
I'll call you that.
Don't.
Only my friends have the right to call me that.
Oh, so let's be friends.
Tsuya!
You're bleeding, my friend.
It's so cute.
And I love blood.
Get away from her!
Against a man with a knife, take a stable position and stand sideways from the attacker.
Grab the back of the neck and the hand.
And push hard, and then pull.
The technique of close combat, which I learned in practice.
Gun-head combat style.
Wow, Ochako.
Tsuya, tie her up with your tongue.
Or does it hurt?
Wait a minute.
Ochako, you're great too.
You don't smell like me.
You love someone, don't you?
And you think you want to be like him.
I'll win!
I'll win and go further like Deku!
I told you.
You're the same as me.
What's wrong with her?
You want to be the same as your beloved.
And to dress the same.
And you even wear the same.
But in the end, this is not enough.
In the end, you want to be like him.
But nothing comes out.
What kind of guy do you like?
I love beaten boys, as well as the smell of blood.
Therefore, I always cut them.
You see, Ochako, it's fun.
I love love stories.
Ochako!
Ochako!
Suck it out.
Suck it out.
Suck it out.
Suck it out.
Suck it out.
Uraraka!
Shoji, guys!
Damn it!
I don't want to die from the hands of such a crowd.
Bye-bye.
Stop!
Wait, it's dangerous.
We don't know the essence of her miracle.
What kind of woman is this?
A villain.
And a crazy one.
Uraraka, are you hurt?
I'm fine.
I can walk.
You'd better look at yourself.
We don't have time.
Let's go.
We need to get out of here quickly.
I'm glad you're all right.
Exactly.
Come with us.
We need to protect Kachan by leading him to the camp.
What?
Protect Bakugo?
Then where is he?
What?
What are you talking about?
Is Kachan behind us?
In such a situation, even the slightest flatness is fraught with consequences.
And now...
What?
Did you lose the guy?
I hid him with my magic.
There is nothing to do with such a talent on the part of the heroes.
We will show him a scene where he can fully reveal himself.
Give him back!
Give him back?
Give him back?
You have a strange request.
Bakugo is not an object to return him.
He is the owner himself, and you are an egoist.
Give him back immediately!
Step aside.
We want to show you something.
You see an incomplete picture.
We want to provide you with alternatives.
You have been imposed with a rule that you must follow.
Not only Bakugo is gone, so is Koyami.
What?
He kidnapped those who ran behind him.
Without making a sound.
He gave himself up to talk to us?
You clearly underestimate us.
I performed on stage when I was young.
That's how I got used to it.
At first, I didn't think of taking Koyami.
Moonfish, our common friend with teeth, is too good at the role of a killer.
He was even refused a pardon.
Who would have thought that such a leader fell from the hands of this young man.
That's why I took him too.
Bastard.
Don't you dare do that!
Midoriya, calm down.
Uraraka, hold on.
Yes.
Sorry, I can only deceive and run.
I'm not a moustache in fights with heroes.
First strike squad, the target is captured.
It's a pity that it's so short, but it's time to lower the curtain.
We meet at the meeting point in five minutes.
Lower the curtain?
We won't let you!
I won't let you!
We won't let them escape.
Hey, Dabi!
Did you hear the message?
I'm shaking.
Mr. Compress got over it quickly.
I didn't even have time to sneeze.
I had a dream, by the way.
Don't tell me.
But he did a good job.
Now we have to wait for them here.
Don't!
Although you're right.
This place is hard to find because of the gas flame.
But the gas has already dissipated.
Something went wrong.
You're right, bro.
Not everything went according to plan.
Aoyama, I have to help the guys from Class B.
Please take them back to the camp.
The gas has dissipated.
One of the villains has been overcome.
They're fighting.
Me?
What should I do?
Did you notice?
Hey, Dabi!
I have an important question.
Why don't you call the police?
You told them to react to your voice.
It would be useful.
Oh, right.
I didn't think about sending him to battle.
Don't speed up, Shaq.
It will hurt to fall on your knees.
The personal hand monster given by Shigaraki.
Maybe he's already killed someone.
Bad! Everything is very bad!
We have bad news!
Yoyorozo, are you alive?
Hey, please, run!
He's catching up!
I'm sorry.
Awase...
I...
I'm okay.
I was on the ground when I woke up.
I don't know what he did to me.
Damn!
What the hell?
What the...
How come?
How come?
Why...
He's leaving.
They got what they came for.
And that means...
Bakuga!
Think...
What a terrible outcome of events!
And how to get the most out of it?
How to get the most out of it?
How to get the most out of it?
How to get the most out of it?
How to get the most out of it?
Awase...
Use your magic on this and that monster.
What's that?
A button?
Just do it!
He's leaving!
I don't know what's going on, but...
I did what you asked.
Thank you, Awase.
I'm so scared!
Now let's run!
Yeah.
Hey, Spinner!
It's all your fault!
Shut up!
Blame yourself for getting in the way of crime.
That's the villain, Spinner.
Get off me, you cow!
Damn!
The spot will rise again!
Did you hear me?
I've revived his will!
Listen to me!
I'll clear the world from the fake heroes!
And from the fool in the glasses!
What are you talking about?
By the way, you didn't show us your magic.
Let me go and shut up!
Exactly.
I'm forced to ask you to free my colleagues.
Damn, he's fast!
We don't have enough food.
But don't go.
They're not that cool yet.
Damn!
But even so...
We won't give up!
We'll catch up with them...
And we'll get back home!
But he keeps breaking away.
Uraraka!
Make us weightless!
And then Asui will throw us to him with his tongue!
What?
Shonji will be able to keep everyone together and control the flight with his hands!
Uraraka, as soon as we get very close,
cancel your spell!
We'll launch ourselves like a rocket!
Wait, Deku!
How are you going to fight such wounds?
She's right.
How is he even conscious?
Midoriya, stay here.
I understand how it hurts.
I don't feel the pain.
I can do it.
Faster!
At least take this, Deku!
Everything's ready, Tsu.
You're the only way to save them.
Come on!
What?
There's no one else?
And then she left.
She got so much blood.
So many people.
Just one.
Just one?
You said you'd get at least three!
Well, there's nothing to do.
I didn't think they'd kill me.
In any case, you look so happy.
Did you really meet a worthy person?
I have new friends.
And I also met a boy.
He doesn't need you.
I love you too.
Shut up, you poor thing.
Hey!
I know these kids!
Who's that?
To be continued...
To be continued...
To be continued...
This is a preview.
Todoroki, Shoji.
Let's save Kachan and Takayami.
And we'll all go back to Yuei together.
In the next episode.
This is a turn.
Go beyond.
Plus Ultra.
