        <pre>A prestigious educational institution in which young heroes are taught, the U.A. Academy.
It is difficult to resist and save people with a smile.
In order to become the greatest of the heroes.

Enhancing our precius.
The class has already begun, let's not lag behind.
Last mid-year, the class was stronger.
The next mid-year will be after us.
It's time to teach the class.
Teacher, I'm sorry, we're not worthy students.
You're talking about improving your skills.
But we have 20 unique skills in our class.
How are you going to do it at the same time?
I'd like to have more details.
Muscles grow when you strain them and tear them.
The same goes for the skills.
The more you use them, the stronger they become.
Otherwise, they are atrophied.
Otherwise, there's only one thing left for you to do.
Get out of here!
Episode 3. Kota
Bakugokatsuki puts his hands in the hot water to expand his pores
and create a much larger explosion, as well as increase the radius of his attacks.
Shit!
Todoroki Shota switches his ice and fire abilities
and achieves the uniformity of the liquid around him.
Maybe he'll be able to use both spells at once
and control his abilities more efficiently.
Seru Kanta.
Endlessly releasing his ribbon, he increases its number
as well as the power and speed of use.
Kirishima Eijiru.
Ojiro Mashiro.
Come on!
Ojiro hits Kirishima with all his might when he activates his reinforcement,
which increases the abilities of their spells.
Kaminaru Denki.
He releases his electricity through a huge capacity battery.
Kota Koji.
In order to increase the radius of his beastly eye,
he does vocal exercises, constantly changing the timbre.
This also helps him to be less shy.
Aoyama Yuga.
He trains his body to constantly use a bubble laser.
This will help him to use it continuously and increase the range of his attacks.
Takayami Fumigaki.
He learns to control his shadow in complete darkness.
Dark shadow!
Urarako Chako.
He constantly spins with zero gravity.
She learns to control her sea sickness
and increases the maximum weight on which she can affect the miracle.
Hidatenya.
He runs further and faster, training his endurance.
Asui Tsuwa.
He trains his body and tongue, climbing over the weightless rocks.

Hegakure Toru and Shodze Mezu.
They increase their ability to perform their miracles.
Shodze tries to detect Hegakure.
After the capture, they start again.
Did we fall into hell?
Activation abilities will support them longer.
For metamorphosis of hybrid creatures,
you will train the active parts of your miracles.
Usually this happens as you grow.
But we don't have time for this.
It's time not to join them.
But if we join, we will have 40 people.
How can six people be able to monitor this?
That's what they're here for.
That's right. Four of us is enough.
The eyes twinkle in the dark.
Let's stretch the paw of help.
It's only worth meeting.
We are looking for ambushes.
I'm coming.
We are cute strong crumbs.
We are wild, wild...
Cats!
Full version.
Shit!
My miracle is searching.
I can monitor hundreds of people at the same time.
I can't find the weakness of the enemy.
And my miracle is the control of the Earth.
I can create sites for your training.
My miracle is telepathy.
I can transmit messages and read people's thoughts.
And I am responsible for the kick.
For forced training and upbringing.
He's obviously out of here.
Shit!
All strengthening types, contact me.
Tiger training has already begun.
It's already started.
Well, quickly prescribed to me in the press.
5%...
Detroit Crush!
Too weak and useless.
This means that your muscles are still not in order.
Yes, sir.
I can't hear you.
Yes, sir.
He's scary.
Plus Ultra, huh?
Make it Ultra.
Yes, sir.
He's clearly not in the right place, not at the right time, not on the right floor.
Wow, a lot of work.
It's even difficult to provide personnel for the Heroes Faculty.
According to the complex list and the pritches of these guys,
they are able to cover all our needs.
There is no better team in the world to quickly train you.
Don't lag behind Class A!
Go, Class B!
Yes, sir!
The Almighty gave me a pritch.
Too strong for my body.
Grant Arena taught me how to control it.
The more you train your body, the more your strength will become.
I went so far just relying on others.
From this moment on, I will put even more effort.
Great!
Use the pritch until you burst!
Yes, sir!
Remember what I said yesterday?
Your food is no longer our concern.
Now you yourself will have to cook.
Curry!
That's right.
Look at them purring.
Just don't think you can eat raw food.
At the rescue operation, we can stay without food and water.
This is part of the training.
As expected from Yue.
Let's make the best curry, guys!
Yeah.
Yes.
Well done.
Todoroki!
Give us the fire!
Makuga!
Can you set fire to your explosion?
You have no doubt about it, moron!
Calm down, guys.
We need to be able to get the fire without a pritch.
Well, I don't mind.
Wow, thank you!
The fire is burning.
Don't set fire to everything here.
Thank you for the food!
I wouldn't be so happy to see even curry in a restaurant.
But after such work, this curry is perfect!
Don't talk, eat!
Yao Momo, do you eat so much?
Yes.
My pritch uses fat to create objects.
The more I eat, the more I will create.
It's like going to the toilet.
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
Kota!
It's dinner time!
Kota!
Kota...
Aren't you hungry?
Try our curry.
Hey, how did you know about this place?
I'm sorry, I followed your footsteps.
I thought you were hungry, so I went to look for you.
Leave me alone!
I don't need anything!
You want me to repeat?
I'm not going to hang out with you!
So get out of my shelter!
Shelter?
Do you want to make up for your pritch?
Disgusting!
Do you want to brag about your strength?
Your parents...
Your parents...
They were from the group Sea Horses.
They had water pritches, right?
Did Mandarine tell you about this?
No, it's...
I'm sorry.
Yes, I heard about it by accident.
I put 2 plus 2 together, so I figured it out.
I heard about this before.
Shut up.
Everyone around is crazy.
They call themselves heroes and villains,
looking for a reason to kill each other.
They all use pritches.
They call themselves idiots.
Not only heroes.
Kota hates pritches.
He hates the superhero community as a whole.
What else?
If you have nothing to say, get out!
No, I have one friend.
My friend didn't inherit the pritches of his parents.
What?
It happens quite rarely nowadays.
He wanted to become a hero, but he couldn't.
It's impossible to become a hero without a pritch.
My friend wasn't sad when he found out that she hadn't appeared.
He tried to move objects and exhaled fire.
But it didn't work.
You can look at pritches in different ways.
I can't judge objectively,
but the more you reject it, the worse and more painful it will be.
You know...
Shut up! I'm sick of it! Get out!
I'm sorry.
I didn't want to bother you.
I'll leave Kari here.
Shut up.
They're all...
This guy...
You know, I hate this thing.
It was mastered by the underground master.
It can handle its own tasks.
I'm not talking about that!
Oh, hi.
Sorry for the wait.
Work, work.
Now we're out of the world.
My hands are itching.
Come on, hurry up.
We don't have time yet.
Shut up, you stupid bastards.
Be patient.
We'll go when the others arrive.
I don't want to go.
I don't want to go.
When the others arrive,
there's no point in risking against this bunch of teenagers.
It's better to wait for the main forces.
This time we'll just leave a warning
that their peaceful life is over.
Hey, liars.
I don't see your efforts.
Wait a minute.
I'm sorry, I didn't fall asleep.
It's all because of the extra classes.
Until two o'clock in the morning.
And we wake up at seven in the morning.
I told you.
You're not just improving your skills.
And as for you,
I warned you that you would give up in hell.
Think about what you're worse than classmates
to move on.
That's right.
Uraraka, Aoyama.
It's about you two too.
You almost failed the exam.
30 points per round.
And you scored 35.
Oh, what a shame.
Don't lose your concentration.
Move faster.
It doesn't matter how, but you have to understand
what you're doing this for.
For this you need progress.
For what you are trying
and agree with my comments.
Put it in your head.
What am I here for?
What am I here for?
What am I here for?
By the way, teacher Aizawa.
It's already the third day and ...
Come on, get to the point.
And don't talk.
And the Almighty ...
And the rest of the teachers will not come?
I already said about this camp.
We don't want to attract the attention of the villains.
You can't let people know about this place.
That's why we four are here.
The Almighty is their main goal.
And we can't invite him here.
To the best or the worst,
he stands out too much.
So, after all, to the worst, huh?
I see.
The Almighty will not come, then.
Guys, don't you ever guess
what's waiting for you tonight.
We will arrange a party for you.
We will arrange a party for you.
We will arrange a party for you.
We will arrange a party for you.
The party will be held tonight.
We will arrange a test of bravery between classes.
After intensive training,
there will be intense entertainment.
This is like a tamed gingerbread.
Blin, I already forgot.
I hate such things.
Mad steam in the darkness.
As if we have little training.
You say, between classes, huh?
Try your best!
Yes, sir.
That's why I'm here, all-powerful.
Hey, show me your plus ultra.
Got it!
Bakugo, you're good with a knife.
I didn't expect that.
What do you mean, you didn't expect that?
You think I can't cut with my left hand?
He hasn't shown us his talents for a long time.
You're all so energetic, huh?
You wanted to ask something about the all-powerful?
You asked the Aizawa teacher about him.
Oh, well... I...
It's about Kota.
Kota? Who's that?
What?
Oh, that boy.
Next to Mandel.
What? He's gone again?
Probably in his shelter again.
He really doesn't like to be among us.
This kid hates heroes.
And he also hates superhumans and their miracles.
I don't know what to say to him.
The all-powerful would have found something to say to him.
What would you say, Todoroki?
I don't even know.
It's not easy, I understand.
Even if you say the right things, you don't know what feeds his hatred.
You can even undermine the situation with such words.
If you convince him with words, it means he didn't give much importance to the problem.
It's not enough to just say it, you also have to act.
Therefore, it is necessary to understand that it will help him to begin to act,
and not just say,
Because of you, I remembered my duty.
You can become a hero.
That's right.
You're right, Todoroki.
If you think about it, I'm just a stranger to him.
I don't know what you want to achieve,
but I would advise you not to get into such a delicate situation.
However, you like to get into other people's problems when they don't ask you.
You're a strange type.
I'm sorry for that.
Guys, come here!
The fire has stopped!
We will cook the best potato with meat in the world!
So we filled our stomachs and washed the plates.
And now it's time for the courage test!
We will pass it!
I'm sorry to upset you,
but the debtors are going to class with me for classes.
Don't joke like that!
I'm sorry.
You didn't really try hard in training,
so now we'll break away for classes.
Let us rest!
Please let us go!
Great! The first one is going to scare Class B.
Class A will go on the path in three minutes.
Group A, go!
In three minutes.
There are two people in each group.
You reach the finish line with your mines,
take them off and come back.
It's time to please me.
He said it again.
You can't touch your victims.
You can only scare them with a spell.
Class A, which will make the other one put more on his pants, will win!
Stop it, it's disgusting.
I see.
It makes us compete with a spell.
You want to teach us their new abilities.
What did you expect from Yui?
It's time to choose a partner for you.
There are two people in the team.
But if we remove the five debtors...
The first, the second, the third, the fourth, the fifth, the sixth, the seventh, the eighth...
Someone is left without a pair.
The first, the second, the third, the fourth, the fifth, the sixth, the seventh, the eighth...
And it's still me!
We pulled it out blindly.
Apparently, you have such a fate.
Hey, tail!
Let's switch, huh?
Aoyama!
Please, switch with me!
Why me?
Crazy time in the dark.
Twelve minutes later.
Great, the fifth team.
Cat, frog, cat, uraraka, go!
I'm scared, Tsuo.
I heard someone screaming.
No, Kyo and Toru.
Hold on to your hands.
It's okay, it's not scary.
Hold on to my hand.
Where are you going? You're just great.
Great job, Yui.
Bakugay Todoroki are so funny.
What does it mean?
By the way, did you notice a strange smell?
Yeah, it's like something was set on fire.
It must be Bakugay Todoroki.
Did you get scared and set something on fire?
Haneuki?
Yui, don't inhale it!
It's smoke.
Some poison.
What's that smell?
It's...
black smoke.
Something's burning.
It's burning near the mountain.
Well, it's time.
What's that, Pixie Bob?
Get to the ground, little stars of the world of heroes.
The strike group of the League of Villains is already here.
All kinds of cats are in the way.
What?
They organized such a guard.
Why is the villain here?
Pixie Bob!
Don't.
