If you're talking about Bakugai Katsuki, then they're under the influence of my magic.
Damn, the guy in the mask is fast!
Well, even so, we won't give up!
We'll catch up with them and get them back home!
You are the only salvation for them!
Go!
Hey! I know these kids!
Who's that?
A prestigious university, the U.A. Academy.
After taking the Heroic course, I continued to pursue my dream.
To resist the difficulties and save people with a smile.
In order to become the greatest of the heroes!

ONE looks right through it.
I was told by the telepathy that the enemy needs Kachan.
Teacher, you heard the message!
They are hunting for our friend! We must act!
Excluded.
But why?
Enough, Kirishima!
Teacher, we do not know how many enemies there are.
It would be logical to increase the number of combat units on our side.
What are you doing? Do you want to fight the villains?
Exactly. Teacher Aizawa gave permission for this.
Only for protection and so that you can get out of here.
Well, who is coming?
Maybe this is Aizawa's teacher?
On time. I'll talk to him.
No, wait.
This is the enemy.
Run! Quickly!
Haven't you already defeated him?
Slowly.
Blood control?
Powerful!
Amazing, teacher Vlad!
You just broke in here without any plan?
You clearly underestimate us.
What do I appreciate here?
You behave as I expected.
You should make a mistake at least once and you will end up.
The peaks of U.A. training and the heroism of the Almighty.
Two pillars on which the heroic community stands.
But a few small incidents can shake their faith.
And the cracks of distrust will spread all over the world.
A helpless educational institution that is unable to protect itself from attacks.
So useless that it could not protect one of its students.
Bastard!
So you still managed!
To kidnap Bakugan!
You shouldn't have contacted us!
We are few, but we drove you into the corner.
Bastard!
Don't waste time, Vlad!
Teacher Aizawa!
He just takes time.
There is no point in interrogating him.
Wiping Aizawa is a trick of the villain!
It's a fake.
The one who attacked earlier is also a fake.
One of the villains?
Look at your head, how is the situation?
Sorry, I was supposed to enter the battle, but I was forced to watch over the cat.
Take care of him, and I'll go back.
I leave the defense on you, I go to the front.
Wait, look at your head.
They can attack us again.
You can handle this easily.
This is a fake.
He took the time to distract you.
And in order to divide us.
So that our attention is focused here.
They do this because they have few people.
If this is the case, then we must leave!
Right!
We have a number of advantages!
I forbid.
Their goal is the students.
Besides, you will only interfere.
Bakugan can only be one of many.
There may be more of us, but we have much less information.
The priority will be the safety of the students.
And again the real one.
Give back Kachana and Takayami!
I know these children!
Who is it?
Mister, step back.
Got it!
It's cold!
Midoriya, what is it?
You were on the list of Shigaraki.
You and the guy who beat him up.
It was definitely not on the list.
Hot!
My name is Toga Izuku.
I thought here.
If you had more blood on you,
then it would not be possible to tear off your eyes.
Midoriya!
And what is this?
Why did you stand between us?
Do you even understand that it is not in my taste?
I will cut you.
She's crazy.
Great!
Easy!
Show everything you can!
Do not slow down!
What's wrong with him?
Damn it!
I did not expect them to follow me.
Not a bad idea.
Where is Bakuga?
Well, of course.
What?
Midoriya, it's the road.
Run!
I do not know your secrets.
I do not know how.
But what you did is clear as day.
Takayami Bakuga.
Inside these balls.
Shoji!
Oh!
And you are fast!
Smart six-handed!
Good trick!
Great!
Shoji!
Idiot!
Wait!
Nomu!
Here!
This guy ...
Was in practice.
This is a warp!
Five minutes have passed since the signal was sent.
It's time to go, Dabi.
I'm sorry, Izuku.
Wait for me, okay?
Wait!
What is our goal?
Oh, you're talking about this?
They were chasing me so hard that I decided to leave them a consolation prize.
Well, you know, this is the basis of magic.
Give the audience what they want to see.
No!
No way!
Is this my ice?
Right.
When you attacked me with ice, I made a couple of fake ones and put them in my pocket.
Damn!
A miracle that can squeeze everything into small spheres!
You saw it.
You were delighted and immediately peed.
And happily went home.
Stop!
On this I bow.
Aoyama!
You're not lucky, Todoroki Shota.
The target has been captured.
You can release.
I ruined the whole performance.
And that's it.
Kachan!
Kachan!
Don't come near me, Dekko!
Kachan!
On that day, we wanted to be heroes, but we completely lost to the villains.
Teacher Vlad King called for help.
In 15 minutes, a rescue squad arrived.
Firefighter ambulance.
Of 40 students, 15 were hit by gas and poisoned.
11 were injured of a different degree of gravity.
13 were not injured.
And one more is considered missing.
Of the six heroes in the prof, one was seriously injured in the head.
And only blood traces remained of the other.
On the other hand, three villains were captured.
The allies left them and disappeared in an unknown direction.
My consciousness gradually faded.
And I remembered the words of Shigaraki Tomura.
You'd better be careful.
Next time we meet, I'll try to kill you.
The summer camp that we've been waiting for so long has ended so badly.
The next day is still a summer vacation.
Will you open the gate?
I'm from Yumiuri TV. I want to talk to the representative of UAE.
How are you going to help the families of the victims?
Being attacked during the preparation for the fight against the villains,
doesn't it seem ironic to you?
We feared the rebirth of villains and were naive, denying this fact.
And now they are leading a full-scale war.
A war to destroy the current society.
Even knowing their intentions, we couldn't stop them.
Who could have predicted such a large number of attacks?
With the appearance of the Almighty.
The level of crime has dropped sharply.
We should have relaxed as soon as we received the bribe.
We thought we would have time to prepare them.
I called on myself as never before.
While everyone was fighting for their lives.
I was relaxing in a comfortable chair.
And we organized a festival right after the attack.
We can no longer act so recklessly.
Student kidnapping is our biggest failure.
They didn't just kidnap Bakug.
They put their trust in us for a big question.
The media is already criticizing us as much as they can.
The reason for the kidnapping of Bakug was his wild temper and unbridled character.
If he is lured to the side of the villains,
then at our school you can put a cross.
By the way, let's get back to the question of trust.
And there are no doubts anymore.
There is a traitor among us.
No one knew about the location of the training camp.
And that's not all.
Any student could use the phone.
Mik, tie it up.
We need to figure this out.
Can you prove that this is 100% not you?
Or prove that one of us is guilty, huh?
We will suspect each other and definitely fall apart.
We can't make a witch hunt in such a situation.
I trust everyone present.
Although I can't prove my innocence either.
First of all, we need to ensure the safety of our students.
And what about the traitor?
I already have a couple of thoughts about it.
The phone call is here.
I'm sorry, I have to answer.
Turn off the phone during the meeting.
What a poor ringtone.
The symbol of the world cannot save its students.
What kind of hero am I?
I'm sorry.
What happened, Tsukauchi?
We interrogated Aizawa and Vlad King.
And something unusual happened.
Most likely, we know where the evil league's logo is.
Is that true, Tsukauchi?
Yes.
Two weeks ago, our agent collected information.
And he found out that a strange man with stitches on his face was inside the building.
But the building turned out to be empty.
According to the description, he was 20-30 years old.
And we decided to check it.
We contacted the owner of the building.
It turned out that there was a small bar there.
Then it didn't give us any useful information.
But now the description coincides with the villain who kidnapped the student.
I know it's hard for you, but we'll collect evidence and cover this place.
It's all secret.
But I trust you with this secret.
We will need the help of a professional hero to save the hostage and detain the villains.
All-powerful, lend us your strength.
All-powerful?
I knew you were a great friend.
When I meet these fools, I'll tell them I'm here to give you credit.
The violators attacked the U.A. training center again.
They call themselves the League of Villains.
They are involved in the attack on the training complex and the city of Hose.
Among the victims of the attack in the training camp was a child of a hero in a sea horse prof.
Perhaps there is some serious problem in the management of the U.A.
I would not send my child to study in the U.A.
I'm really happy with the eyes we got.
Hey, don't you agree?
Bakugokatsuki
The next day, I was taken to the nearest hospital.
Two days later, I turned off the pain and turned away from the temperature.
A healing girl came to treat me, and the police came to ask questions.
But I don't remember the details.
When you wake up, please eat and call me back.
This is my mother's handwriting.
I can't take it anymore. My heart can't take it anymore.
Kota, I hope he's all right.
Oh, Midoriya, you woke up.
Have you seen the news? The school is full of dirt.
Even worse than in the spring.
We brought you a melon. Everyone threw themselves on a big melon.
I'm sorry for all the trouble, Midoriya.
No, it's my fault.
No.
Jiru and Hagakura are still unconscious because of the gas.
And Yaoi Rose is hospitalized after a severe head injury.
She only came to consciousness yesterday.
In general, there are not enough three.
Not enough four.
Bakugokatsuki
There are not enough three.
Not enough four.
Bakugokatsuki is also not there.
Hey, Doroki!
Kachan!
Don't come near me, Deku!
The Almighty said,
You won't be able to save everyone.
You just have to save those you can reach.
But I ... I was next to him.
And I couldn't save him.
What else is my miracle for?
It turns out that the teacher Aizawa was right all this time.
If you behave recklessly, you will have to save yourself.
My body.
I couldn't move.
I only had enough strength to save the cat.
I couldn't save anyone else.
Then let's go and save him.
I came here yesterday and found Todoroki.
Todoroki, what are you doing here?
What about you?
Well, I couldn't sit and wait and I ...
That's how it is.
Me too.
On the way to your room,
we heard the Almighty officer of the police talking to Yao Yurouzu.
Thanks to you from Class B,
I was able to attach a tracking sensor to one of the villains.
This device receives a signal.
Use it for investigation.
Not long ago, Aizawa said that you didn't have enough courage to make decisions.
Well, that's great work.
Thank you, Yao Yurouzu.
That's all I could do while my classmates were in great danger.
It's a feeling and it makes you a hero.
Now it's up to us.
So you want Yao Yurouzu to make us another one?
And what about it?
In any case, we take full responsibility for everything you've done.
I'm sorry.
You're welcome.
Great, you know what you've done.
Just try not to repeat mistakes.
We have to trust the Almighty.
These professionals will deal with it.
We don't have a place there, fools.
We know it without you.
But we have to do it.
I can't do anything about it.
We knew they were hunting for him.
And we couldn't do anything about it.
If I don't do anything now,
if I can't do anything now,
I can't call myself a hero anymore.
Kirishima, we're in the hospital, don't shout.
I understand you, but don't shout here.
Ida is right.
I know that Ida and all of you are right.
I understand it perfectly.
But...
Midori, do you understand me?
We can save him!
