        <pre>There is a prestigious university called the Academy of UA.
After entering the hero courses, I continued to pursue my dream.
To resist the difficulties and save people with a smile on their faces.
In order to become the greatest of heroes!
And now, it's my turn
One and only
No matter how many times I cry, I can't stop
I don't expect it to be simple days
Follow my way
Take me to the sadness
Follow my way
I aim for the future
Hey, boy!
I know why I have to give up
Make my story
I want to live with you
I'm sure there will come a day when I feel like crying
When I look back at those times
I want to make my way forward
One and only
The U.A. Academy has sent our hero's course to be licensed
And for that you need to pass the exam
If you pass the exam, you will become a tiger
You will get the title of semi-professionals
You will do your best
Each participant will have three targets on the body
If the ball hits the target, it lights up
The participant who lights up the last target gets the so-called frag
The student who gets two frags goes on
If you love your class so much, then it was worth explaining to them such an important detail
Each time the same thing is repeated
U.A. will destroy
One for all
Full coverage
Killing style
Dark shadow
U.A. will destroy
Why do they need to know such nonsense?
It will not change what they need to do
They just need to overcome this little difficulty
Being a hero means surpassing yourself
When you become a professional
And the whole world knows about you
I'm sorry what I'm saying
But we look further at the other academies
Listen, Six
This is the system of the exit exam
It's best suited to attacking miracles
But it's clearly not everything, right?
No, maybe some will be lucky
But the main advantage is received by those who know how to work in the team and collect information
This will be a key factor in the exam
At first glance, you need to hurry up
But this should not be done
Oh, they took all the shells
Less from the guys from U.A.
It would be stupid to expect
Well, then let's add more difficulties
Ketsubutsu Academy
Second year of training
Shikuyi Makabe
Miracle strengthening of objects
With one touch can make any object super strong
However, it does not work on living beings
I trust you
Put it on me
Maybe this is a big mistake on my part
But I hope no one will notice if I put a couple of students
The target is fixed
Boomerang
Half-month trajectory
This is a good shot
The balls move under the ground
You will not react to this
Ketsubutsu Academy
Second year of training
Etejirotakeki
Miracle boomerang
It can throw objects at any trajectory, ignoring obstacles
Even if it's the earth
But where are they?
Go away, I'll take care of it
Sound amplifier
Wireless headphones
Heartbeat sound
She's trying to knock them out
But
What?
Oh, they're flying to me
Viscosity and solubility to the maximum
Acid weight
Thank you
Great technique
I concentrated my acid to the maximum
Did you come up with so many super techniques?
Of course
Black ankh
Simplified the phrase, but made it cooler
Biting nails of darkness
Take it
Strong
Ketsubutsu Academy
Second year of training
Nakagami Tatami
Miracle telescope
It can instantly change the size of the body and limbs
It will make you faint
Of course, this is not the class we saw at the festival
They have become much stronger since then
Oh, we're in a little deadlock
The exam was passed by zero people
As soon as there are results, I will inform you
Zero people passed?
The only way to go is to hit the target
In other words, they are our weak points
Each of us will try to protect them
The fact of a random throw is incredibly low
Well, then we will add difficulties to them
Before that, they noted our weaknesses
They watched the miracles and behavior
The real battle will begin right now
Great
We look much further than the rest, right?
The story is beautifully told, Stork
Many of the children are going to become heroes
And the strength does not come from fame or a well-known name
You just need to believe in yourself, look after the younger
So you become stronger
Go away, they have a strong defense
Break
Maximum power
Earthquake
Oh, damn it, run away from here
What the fuck
Some kind of madness
We also have super techniques
Ketsubutsu Academy, second year of study
Shinda-yo, a miracle of vibration
It can create vibrations of various radius forces
It can even create destructive earthquakes
Earthquake? Or someone's miracle?
No, it's a miracle in any way
Whose miracle is this?
Which academy?
Don't lose concentration, the enemies are close
Okay, it's time for a couple of participants to go through
Wind
Our swords
All my swords were carried by the wind
I believe that heroes need passion
If you fight, then fight with passion
I love passion
He is from the Shiketsu Academy
Is he alone there?
What is he carrying? I don't understand
He took all our swords, what should we do?
Allow me to join your passion
I will say thank you in advance
Well, finally, the first one passed
What? 120 participants were knocked out
One person knocked out 120?
Great, I won
Such a surprise helped me wake up for a while
Then it will only be more interesting
Guys, do it as quickly as possible
What a miracle
You can't fight with such a middle of the building
We need to get together again
Otherwise we will play Narukoke Tsubutsu
I have to find the others as quickly as possible
We will end up alone
They know how to use each other's skills
They are on a completely different level
We have a whole year of training
Simply put, we do not have enough experience
If he was the best of those who received the recommendation,
does that mean he is stronger on the road?
For me, it's a great honor to stand next to you
Maximum power!
Earthquake!
Earthquake!
Earthquake!
Earthquake!
Earthquake!
Earthquake!
Earthquake!
Earthquake!
Earthquake!
They are the strongest
I don't know why, but I can't help but be delighted
She appeared out of nowhere
Got it
You know, it's bad
It's dangerous to walk alone
But it's even weirder to smile at such a moment
She...
Ishiketsu!
You're so cool
What an earthquake!
You can die like this
We need to find the others
But if I shout, they'll find me quickly
They're not that far from here
You can't fight alone
First I'll find the others
And now I need to be careful
It's time to hide
In exams like this one
I prefer to track down opponents I know a lot about
I thought, Yui is the most vulnerable academy
That's why I ran here as soon as possible
I don't often have the opportunity to fight a strong opponent
I'd like to know more about you
You talk too much
Ketsubutsu Academy is somewhere near
I don't have time to talk to her
She understands that too
Most likely she has an ally nearby
Or is she very strong?
There's no choice
I'm going to dodge
She's gone
Where is she?
I just need to hit you with a ball
It's dangerous
Counter!
Nothing will come out
Do you think my miracle will let me disappear?
Damn it!
I was just playing hide-and-seek with you
Playing hide-and-seek?
Right
I can do that
I can distract the opponent's attention and look away from myself
And at that moment I don't breathe and don't think
Not thinking is the most difficult part
Did you learn this in Shiketsu?
The secret is not to think about what you don't think
I told you about myself
Now it's your turn
Why do you want to become a hero?
Honor?
Pride?
Or someone's request?
I'd like to know
Damn, Shiketsu is here too
This is bad
Damn it!
Damn it!
I ran into a large group of one
This is the worst scenario of all
They're coming
Turn around
Turn around
Turn around
Just turn around
Are you okay?
Uraraka
Grab her hand, faster!
What?
She has a plan?
Catch them faster!
They're so annoying!
I'll catch her
Hey, wait!
Last time I decided to fight
But I hurt my hands
I broke them
And I couldn't save Kachan at the right moment
Then the Almighty
Wouldn't have to fight all for one
Then
I could protect Koto
And give him to the teacher Aizawa
And I would have turned out to be a villain faster
If I had trained my legs then
Then I would have saved everyone
Open up!
To save everyone
I have to be the fastest
Damn it!
He destroyed our support!
No, I think this will be enough
For a temporary license for sure
That's what the Almighty told me
I still can't get 100%
I won't use all 100%
Instead my steel boots will do
I don't have to strain my legs so much
Because they are strong enough in these boots
They make my legs stronger
And strengthen my idea of an ideal hero
30 people have passed, right?
Why are they taking so long?
They should hurry up
The guy from UAE is running fast
He's gone!
Where did he hide?
He's somewhere nearby
Who would have thought that he would make such an effective move?
Are they chasing us?
No
Did they give up?
Thank you
Sorry, I made a mistake
It's okay, it's okay
It's okay
I know
Are you Shiketsu?
What?
Uraraka trained a lot
She may not be in weightlessness for a long time
Otherwise she starts to feel sick
But for some reason everything is fine with you
Besides
You appeared before everyone without any plan
You are definitely not Uraraka
You saved me, you know
Did you really use me?
At that moment I didn't know
But in the end I was lucky
If it was not Uraraka
I could have accidentally hurt her back
Yes?
I see
But now I want to know more
Tell me more
Can't you wait until the end of the exam?
Will you save someone?
What are you ready for?
Where did you spend your time?
Where is your clothes?
Why are you naked?
Please put on
I don't need clothes
Did you hurt her?
What's wrong with her?
Damn
Lenta
Midoriya
What is this pornography?
Cheese
Uraraka
No
No
What a reaction
And I went to the most interesting
I'm so sorry
I really
Really
I want to talk to you more
But it seems that nothing will come out now
This is bad
Uraraka Uchako
He trusts you
What?
Stop, pervert
Don't follow her
But why?
It seems that she hid her clothes because of her magic
She will continue the hunt for us
But we don't have time to pursue her
We can't get a frag from her
By the way, you two are real
What are you carrying, Midoriya?
Well, this girl turned into Uraraka to deceive me
What?
She was naked, Midoriya
Why do you care?
She was in a suit
So she can turn into others
Most likely
In other academies, they really know a lot about us
They even know that you and Uraraka are good friends
Because we were in the same team at the sports festival
Now I understand
By the way, how did you find me?
Well, I saw your fight and ran
I met Uraraka on the way
I'm glad we made it
Yes, thank you
Now the three of us are together
But isn't it better for us to wait for the others?
They are trying to take us by the crowd
But 30 people have already passed
We need to hurry
A little more and we will be late
They move in groups of 10 or more people
I could attack first, but it's too hard
Perhaps they have those who can resist my surprise
Ideally, we should fight in groups
I need to choose a simpler target to attack
So let's see
What do we have on the results?
52 people have already passed
No, it seems 53
So among them were those who knocked out more than two people
230 have already knocked out
Oh, 54 have just passed
It's already more than half
Finish faster
I can't wait for it
That's lucky
As expected from the second place of the UA sports festival
It seems to be on the road
I didn't think you would run alone
Apparently, you are very self-confident
They just kicked him out of the group
You are one against ten
What are you going to do?
I will thank you for saving my time
Funny little
Damn, I can't move
Did you watch the festival at all?
Of course we watched
The miracle-making objects are bigger
Not yet
I need more ice
I don't think he can make them bigger
I can't ignite it
Why doesn't the fire work?
Because it's not ordinary metal
But it can withstand any temperature
Didn't I tell you, Todoroki
Even if you're too cool to be in the team
I'm not giving up
I want to be in the team
Don't underestimate us
