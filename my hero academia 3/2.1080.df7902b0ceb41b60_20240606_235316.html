        <pre>The evil continues its active action in the superhero community, no matter how many times they tried to deal with them, constantly hiding in the dark, they accumulated their strength, and now the time has come for them to take another step.
I did not expect less from the Master, it seemed impossible for me to assemble such a group, and it does not matter how it looks.
It's not bad to have such a backup in the stock, isn't it, Shigaraki Tomura?
Maybe.
The Alliance contacted me, they say that they will deliver the goods in the morning.
Although they were in a hurry, I vouch for the quality.
I apologize for not making my order more accurate.
You know, Shigaraki, why do you think the Alliance took such a stupid request?
Because they expect a lot from you.
If the League of Villains starts active action, then the rest of the underground organizations will come into action.
And when this happens, we will all be able to benefit from it.
Do not worry, you will soon be so busy that you will not have time to chat.
Can't wait to see it.
Well, in any case, see you.
My weapon and my prey have arrived at the scene.
It's time to start the game.
A prestigious educational institution in which young heroes are taught, the UA Academy.
After taking the Heroic course, I continued to pursue my dream.
To resist the difficulties and save people with a smile.
In order to become the greatest hero.
I am a hero.

My Heroic Academy 3rd season
Episode 1
The first semester of training is over, and it's time for summer classes.
And that means...
Those who want to become heroes will have to forget about the vacation.
We will pursue the summer training camp and strive for even greater heights, plus Ultra! Yes!
Deku, it's finally time for the summer camp!
Yes, you're right, Uraraka!
Too close!
Something happened?
No, I...
Do you love him?
Yes, it's time for the camp, the camp!
The camp, the camp!
Uraraka and the others are so excited!
What? The class is going to additional classes?
They say it's because they failed the test!
What?
It's a rumor, it's just a rumor!
Does it mean that they are worse than Class B?
How can that be? Oh, oh, oh!
Excuse me.
Manomo is scared.
Wow, Class B!
Everything happened at the festival, but still my congratulations to the class.
Let's get on the bus!
Yeah!
There will be girls not only from Class A, but from Class B!
Even more buns!
You're obviously impudent, Uraraka.
Class A bus is here!
Let's all sit down in places!
Listen, the bus will stop once an hour.
After that...
Maybe we should turn on the music?
They're just talking.
Okay, let them have fun while they can.
Wild, wild cats!
Finally a break.
I need to go to the toilet.
Is this a place for rest?
What? And where is Class B?
I want to go to the toilet!
I'll lie if I say that we're just like that.
And where is Class B?
Long time no see.
Our eyes shine and light up in the dark.
We're cute, stylish little girls.
Wild, wild...
...cats!
I present to your attention the team of professional heroes, the cats.
One of the four teams that organized the Heroic POP-Soyuz.
They're from Class A!
Class A!
The team that organized the Heroic POP-Soyuz.
They specialize in saving in mountainous areas.
I've had combat experience at the post for 12 years.
I'm still 18 years old.
18 years old?
I'm 18 years old.
She's desperate.
Greet them.
I'm glad to meet you.
This is our territory.
Our camp is located at the foot of that mountain.
It's too far!
Why did we stop here then?
Does it mean...
No, no, no, it can't be.
Maybe we should go back to the bus?
Faster.
Of course.
Let's go back.
It's 9.30 a.m.
If you hurry, you'll be late for noon.
How come?
Back off!
Run to the bus!
Faster!
I'm glad we didn't make it to 12.30 a.m.
Sorry, kids.
Your training...
has already begun.
How come?
What the hell?
Hey!
You can use the pre-wonder without restrictions.
You have three hours.
I advise you not to waste your time.
Go through the forest of magical animals.
Forest of magical animals?
Are we in the game of Dragon Quest?
Yuei likes things like that.
There's no other choice.
Let's go faster.
I'm going to be torn!
I need to hide in the bushes.
It's...
a beast!
Please stop!
It's a beast!
Go back!
Is the code's pre-wonder not working?
It's the Earth's globe.
I see.
It's the pre-wonder of Pixie Bob.
It's the Earth's globe.
I see.
It's the pre-wonder of Pixie Bob.
I see.
You've got some crazy methods.
We had to speed up the training process for them.
Usually, such a course takes two years of training,
so it's going to be even harder for them in the future.
The pre-wonders are usually limited,
but now they can be used freely.
It doesn't matter if you get a temporary license.
They had to face evil too early.
So it's time to learn to stand up for yourself.
One for all!
Full cover!
Reverse acceleration!
Die!
Destroyer!
I'm leaving them to you, Pixie Bob.
Trust me!
I'm going to get goosebumps!
Wow! You did it!
You did it!
You did it!
And I did it!
You're good, Bakugo!
That's not enough!
How many of them are there?
What are we going to do? Run?
That's not funny.
We won't have time for lunch at this pace.
We just have to get through the shortest route.
Yeah.
Great!
Go, Kwasa!
Yeah!
Three ahead!
And two in the back!
Seven in total.
They're coming!
Great! I'm coming!
Sato! Kirishima!
Dark Shadow!
Yeah!
Aoyama! Now!
Last hit!
Damn it!
Is it your fault that my pants got wet?
Back off, Mineta!
1.3 million volts!
Hurray!
All the birds of the forest!
Help us destroy the evil animals!
Take this!
Oh, no! He sees me!
Hagakure! Great bait!
Take this!
Please cover us!
You did it, Yaoi Rose!
Come on, Tsu!
Leave it to me!
Quack!
Quack!
No!
There's more!
Get out of the way, two-faced!
Not at all.
Go, Midoriya!
Yeah!
Come on! Do you want to play more?
Kota, let's go!
How stupid is that?
Are they stupid?
Just don't tell me that they want to be heroes.
You're finally here, kittens!
And it took a lot of time.
What do you mean, three hours?
It's the time that comes with us.
I'm sorry.
Did you try to brag about how much better you are?
That's mean!
I want to eat! I'm going to die!
Meat, meat, meat, meat!
I thought you were going to eat for a long time.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I thought you were going to eat for a long time.
You guys handled my animals so well.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Real tigers, especially you four.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I want to meet you three years later.
I'm the first one to beat you.
And what do you want from me?
Mandala was always so active.
I'm sorry.
She's in a hurry.
You're almost married.
Married?
And what?
I've been wanting to ask her for a long time.
What kind of child is that?
That's...
That's my nephew.
Kota, go say hello.
Let's live together for a whole week.
I'm Midoriya.
I go to school at the Yo-E Academy.
Nice to meet you.
Midoriya!
Minoriya! Why are you so cruel?
Why did you hit Minoriya on the balls?
I'm not going to hang out with a bunch of bad guys.
Hang out? Are you even that old?
I like him.
He looks like you.
What does he look like me for?
Don't even open your mouth on this subject, got it?
I'm sorry.
Stop explaining and take your things from the bus.
Put your things in the rooms and go down to the dining room for dinner.
Then take a bath and leave.
The real training starts tomorrow.
That's it, go.
Bon appetit.
Really?
Are there fewer girls in the room?
Why are there more guys?
I want to take a look. Can you take a look later?
Of course, come in.
Boring! What a boring rice!
It immediately gets absorbed into my organs.
I can't wait for the competition for dinner.
I can keep going.
A clay pot? Do you cook in a clay pot?
Yes.
It looks like you've gone crazy from hunger.
We will only cook for you today.
Eat while you can.
Thank you.
Hey, cat, bring the vegetables, please.
Well, well.
To be honest, the food is nothing for me.
This will not satisfy my appetite.
I knew why I came here.
And what is waiting for me on the other side of the wall?
What are you talking about there, Mineta?
How great!
I love hot springs.
You hear, guys, they are there.
It's strange that they didn't split up during the girls and boys.
It must be just a happy coincidence.
Just don't tell me that you...
Mineta, stop it!
Your behavior is disrespect to yourself and the girls.
This is shameful behavior.
Don't be so boring.
This is a wall.
Nothing for me!
Plus Ultra!
Finally, this moment has come.
The magnificent moment of my life.
Before you become a hero, you need to become a human.
Damn kid!
Mineta couldn't help it.
Thank you, cat!
Hooray!
Watch out!
He lost consciousness in the air.
Thank you.
I heard that you have a form of perversion in your class.
So I asked him to take a closer look.
Girls grow fast in our time.
I'm glad he didn't get hurt.
You tried so hard to save him.
I'm not going to hang out with a bunch of non-heroes.
Why does the cat hate the heroes so much?
At his age, children always think about the heroes and want to become them.
So do I.
This is the first time I see a child who would think about the heroes like that.
You're right.
Of course, there are a lot of people in society who, to put it mildly, are not fans of heroes.
If he grew up in a normal family, he definitely wouldn't be like he is now.
Normal?
Mandela's cousin.
Cat parents were heroes.
But they were killed when they were executed for a long time.
Two years ago.
They were protecting the city from villains.
It's an honor for a hero to leave life like that.
But...
Dad?
Mom?
But you can't explain that to a child.
His parents were the whole world to him.
But they left him alone.
And society shook their hands.
As if they did something right.
It's not surprising that he has such a bad opinion about us now.
He's here because he has nowhere else to go.
The cat doesn't understand the heroes.
They are disgusting to him.
Why is he constantly smiling?
As if he can save everyone in the world.
It may sound like I don't care about their problems.
But everyone has their own opinion.
Because our values are so different, I couldn't find what to tell them.
Good morning, kids.
Today we will start training to significantly increase our strength.
This will be our goal.
To increase your strength.
And as soon as possible to give you a temporary license.
The active villain has grown.
And my task is to prepare you for all dangers.
Let's get down to business.
Let's start with Bakug.
Throw the ball away.
Is it like physical training?
Your previous record was 705.5 meters.
Let's see how much you've gotten stronger.
Wow, we'll find out how much you've improved.
After all, three months have already passed.
Now it will probably fly a kilometer.
Come on, Bakug.
Well, go straight to ...
Right here!
Right here?
709.6 meters.
What?
Not as far as I thought.
In three months you have gained a lot of experience.
But as for the emotional and technical components.
Obviously, you lack strength and endurance.
Especially endurance.
How do you feel?
Your pritches have not become stronger.
Therefore, we will work on improving your pritches.
It will be hard for you.
And you can die.
But I ask you not to do this.
The continuation follows.
Sounded specifically for Jump Club.
Timing and work with the sound of the Fraxinus Tech-Cheatel Jam.
Let's hear it again.
Let's go!
Get ready for ...
We have already received a package from Tomura.
He said that we are enough and we can go.
Pulsating.
Pulsating.
Come on, faster.
It's too early.
Didn't they say to do it quietly?
Yes.
Despite the fact that he attacked me first, let him behave as the chief.
This is just a signal fire.
After which, stupid heroes will finally be destroyed.
To create a bright future.
This is a preview.
Kota is a relative of mandalas and wild cats.
And he is very prejudiced against heroes.
And what happened to him?
In the next episode, Kota!
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
