Next chapter
I don't want to see him.
He won't be able to save apparently.
We have more chances at saving him than Ho Europe.
We can never live without him.
How did you even survive?
I did the same to support myself.
As you can see, it helped a lot, and oddly enough, I liked the taste of it.
I'm still against it! He wants to eat Kaneki!
You don't have to worry. I'll keep an eye on him. This won't happen.
What about CCG, Yoma?
Looks like they're ready to attack right after the evacuation of the residents.
We'll save Kaneki, using the CCG attack as a cover.
Any objections?
Kaneki...
The End
You finally woke up.
Do you like it?
My room.
Tatara, you don't need me anymore.
Now I've taken you away from me.
I'm happy.
I've been waiting for this moment since our...
...first meeting.
No.
And before that...
That's why...
Don't disappoint me!
The liquid that's suppressing Arcee.
Being inserted into Gullia's body, it blocks his Kagon.
After that, his body becomes vulnerable, and my scalpel can easily cut it, just as a human.
Since you can't pierce the body with a needle, there is one place where it will be easy for us to enter.
This is the slimy eye shell.
The situation is as follows.
Two months ago, a shopping mall was captured.
It is known that at the moment there are about 500 bullets.
So many of them have become over the past week.
After the operation started.
Here you go.
What is it?
A gift from Mada.
He wanted you to take advantage of them.
The first group will head to the main entrance.
Then the second and third groups will sneak into the building.
After the cleaning, you are allowed to split.
All civilians are evacuated.
And now go!
Yes, sir!
The police and the CCG community, with a total of more than a thousand people, are preparing to enter the 11th district.
The operation is commanded by the man who discovered the Guli's logo.
Special investigator Maruda Itsuki.
Ninety-nine percent of our forces will deal with cleaning the area and saving people.
The remaining one percent will provide support to all those in need.
Do not give up!
Let's bring peace back to the 11th district!
This was Special Investigator Maruda.
Itsuki.
Go to other news.
Where did you stop?
Five hundred fifty-nine.
Five hundred fifty-two.
I'll be back when everything is back to normal.
Five hundred...
Get out of here.
Forty-five.
Kaneki.
Mr. Banjo.
I swear, I'll get you out of here.
Hold on a little longer.
Why?
I...
I was told that Risa died.
You didn't tell me not to be upset about it.
You're a good guy.
Suiharu, my friends.
You can ask them anything.
Hold on, Kaneki.
Kaneki.
Everything's ready.
Mr. Uta, are you with us too?
Of course.
Kaneki is my best client.
I guess everyone's here.
Let's go.
Something's wrong.
What did you feel?
Fight him, Amon.
What did you think?
He doesn't look like the others.
He's kind of cautious.
Hmm.
It happened before he was called Jason.
CCG grabbed him and sent him to the Guli's detention center.
And there, how should I put it,
one unscrupulous investigator took care of them.
Five hundred and fifty-nine.
Five hundred and fifty-two.
Show me more.
Five hundred and forty-five.
More!
But he was subjected to severe torture,
resulting in him creating a different personality.
For the sake of surviving.
And then...
He broke.
Since then, any torture has been a pleasure for him.
He did the same to the others as he did to him.
Soon after that, he was called Jason around the city.
It was faster than expected, wasn't it?
Yeah.
Bin brothers, the main building.
Yes, sir.
Kirishima, the construction site.
Got it.
Let's go.
The rest is up to you, Nora.
Where is Yemuri?
Who knows.
I wish I knew where he is.
What a jerk.
At such a time.
He's making fun of the weak.
More and more.
More.
And more.
Don't!
Please!
Stop!
Enough!
It's so quiet in here.
223...
200...
How can they resist?
The enemy is using cover and shields from Kagune.
So they are ex-soldiers.
Damn!
Are you kidding me?
Give it to me!
What's up, boss?
Hurry up and blow up this sniper nest!

Go upstairs.
Roger that.
By the way, I don't see Suzio.
He won't die until he answers the bike.
Let's go after him.
Yes, sir.
Hold on!
Hold on, hold on, hold on!
Come on!
Don't die!
Don't die!
How cruel.
Thank you.
Kaneki.
Mr. Banjo asked me to give you something.
I promise we'll save you.
So...
Hold on.
All right, Kaneki, we'll be back soon.
We'll definitely save you.
Kaneki, where are you?
It's...
Hold on!
What are you doing here, rabbit?
Is that guy back?
Mr. Mada.
Fire, fire!
What the...
Load!
Fire, fire!
Upstairs!
It's no use.
They came faster than I thought.
These sounds...
Don't worry.
Apparently, they fell through.
And Rimi, you're amazing.
One day you'll be the same Hinami.
Kaya, where's the CCG now?
They split into three groups.
CCG upstairs.
Looks like there's no choice.
We need to win some time.
Kaya, take care of Hinami.
All right.
You!
I'll kill you!
Is he that strong?
Why is he here?
Is it because of me?
I can't make it.
You can't escape!
Who was that?
Hey, that was the third combo.
Not bad.
S-level.
I'm Bin.
Who else are you?
None.
If you believe my smell,
it looks like a strong scent
has brought me to you,
Mr. Cool Pepper.
Don't relax.
It's not an ordinary gul.
What a beautiful mouth.
Give me a passionate kiss.
Let's get started.
One versus S-level.
Will I make it?
Mr. Mad.
What do you think, Shomon?
Can a young man win
if he has to fight a gul?
I think it depends
on strength and endurance.
You're right.
But if you face it,
you won't be able to win.
What would you do
to overcome the difference in strength
and win?
Is there anything you can do
to overcome the difference
in strength and endurance?
No.
First combo.
Got it?
Calm down, Amon.
While you're fighting for the right thing,
you can play dirty.
I have a tool
called Kura.
Just for you.
If I die,
I want it to be
with you, Amon.
Mr. Mad.
Amon!
I can't die here.
Until I avenge you.
Kaneki!
Look around more often,
you fool.
Mishiki?
Yo, stupid sister.
What are you doing here?
What about me?
Third group.
First exit on the third floor.
Second group cleared the west entrance
of the main building.
What do you have, Shinahara?
They cleared the fifth floor and parking.
Let's go upstairs.
Got it.
Like in the good old days.
Yeah.
They're all good guys.
Shinahara, we're on the roof.
You can't see the ULGIRI group.
That's weird.
Mr. Shinahara!
Amon, are you okay?
Mr. Shinahara, actually...
What's the matter?
Here, Maru.
One-eyed owl.
Shinahara,
leave only the veterans
who don't mind dying with you.
If you don't kill him,
no one will kill him.
Death without a reason
will not win us time.
Hold him as long as you can.
End of communication.

When you're depressed,
the best way is to take a ride.
When my unworthy subordinates
or the pressure of the management
get me,
the ride on the bike is very exciting.
You're my best partner!
After cleaning the 11th district.
Huh? The keys?
Cool!
What do you want?
A minute has passed.
Next, episode 12.
Ghoul.
