Let's get started.
It's mine!
Yours? Are you stupid?
There's nothing here.
It belongs to you.
That's easier.
It's mine!
Wow! That's a good one, Kaguna.
I'm so happy for Kirishima.
I can't believe I got it from Kaguna, who's weaker than me.
I didn't expect to see you like this.
It looks like you woke up.
It was my passion!
Let me decorate Kaneki dishes with your insides.
What a wonderful snack.
Thank you.
It's mine!
Not bad, Kirishima.
It looks like you have no choice.
I didn't plan it, but to win this battle...
I need a snack!
I need a snack!
Nishiki?
Are you a zombie?
Let me go!
Get your hands off me!
Let me go!
That's enough.
Kaneki!
That was cruel, wasn't it?
I'll have to...
...save myself...
...for a long time.
Kaneki, please...
...let me bite off...
...just one...
...piece.
You can help yourself.
Damn you.
Kimi...
Nishiki?
Hold on.
I'll untie...
...you.
Nishiki.
Step back.
Toka?
She knows who we really are, doesn't she?
You can't leave...
...such a dangerous girl alive.
Toka!
Don't.
She's a girl.
She's the same as Hideo for me...
...and Yoriko for you.
What if Yoriko was in her place?
Would you...
...be able to kill her?
Shut up!
I'll kill her!
So that doesn't happen!
Nishiki?
Thank you.
What does it mean?
What does it mean?
What does it mean?
What does it mean?
What does it mean?
Nishiki!
Nishiki!
Thank God!
Is this...
...beautiful?
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I'll cut her off.
I'll cut her off.
I can't see it, I can't find it
Don't look at me
I don't want to hurt you
In the world someone created
Remember me
After the incident in the church, Vanteiko has changed a lot
Come on, don't be angry
What are you doing?
Nishio-senpai?
Hi, Nogachko
I see you're like a fly flying over shit
Nishio started working at Vanteiko
I think you shouldn't kill people anymore for Kimi
Thanks to the food that we have, you can live a carefree life, Gure
However, you have to do it
Otherwise, you will work here, Nishio
Oh, Mr. Nishio
The more I look at you, the less you fit into the situation
Shut up, we haven't even opened yet
Why did you start working here?
Shut up, there's a reason
Don't tell me it's because of Toki
Damn, I'm so right
By the way, Toki is still not well?
Yes
Since that day, Toka has not appeared at work
The shop is closed
It would be better if I was with my dad
What's wrong with her?
Who knows, everything happens in life
Damn, I have to go to class
Thanks for the treat
Hinami
It's my fault
Now that he's not around, I have to be much stronger
I'm sorry for the question, but why is Hinami angry?
You see, my husband has not been around for a long time
That's why she wants to see him
Where is Hinami's father now?
I'm the sea
It's terribly quiet today, isn't it?
Take this thing and go
Not bad
You're a real pro at this
With this I...
You can no longer come
I see I'm not welcome here
I don't need problems, please
Okay
Hinami, Ryoko, we'll see you soon
But first I want to ask you something
When the hell did you start following orders from people?
Once he started doing dangerous work in the 13th district
But after the birth of Hinami, he quit this job for us
He's a good person
For us with Hinami, he's the best
Okay
It's...
It's okay, I'm her mother
I can still tease her
The suitcases!
What did the pigeons forget here?
Looks like we didn't wait for it
You need to catch a small fish for a low food
On the other hand, it's not a feast
Mr. Mada, it's...
Jason
Why did such a big fish from the 13th district come here in the 20th?
Let's hear it from his mouth
Level S
Jason from the 13th district
Hinami?
It's mom
Can you open the door?
No, I don't want to talk to you
Hinami, you...
I want to see my dad
Why? Why can't I?
I hate you
Stop it, Hinami
I'm sorry, I didn't want to scream
Do you miss your dad?
Do you miss your dad?
He misses you too, Hinami
But we'll only make it worse if we go see him now
I'm sorry for making you wait
Jason
Jason
Jason
Jason
Are you okay?
Two minutes is enough
I'm sorry, I didn't follow him
Don't worry, you'll deal with him later
Okay
You...
You look pretty fragile
Are you okay, Amon?
Yeah
Take a break
Sad
I agree
Not bad
Do you want to sleep?
Through your body
Time's up, let's play some more
Damn it, Mr. Mada
Looks like the instrument's broken
And now...
What do we do with this waste?
Hinami
I miss my dad too
Mom
Hinami
Hinami, I'm sorry
Mom, don't cry
Yeah, I won't cry anymore
Thank you, Hinami
Let's wait for dad to come back
Jason managed to escape
The instrument's broken, we were helpless
However...
We'll just beat them one by one until we get another chance
That's right
Let's use it
Well, since I'm sorry, I suggest we go to the store and buy you a present
What do you want?
Okay, think about it
Yeah
Thank you, mom
Thank you
What do you want?
It's about tomorrow's shift
I'm Paz
Listen
I couldn't kill her
Recently, Hinami and Ms. Ryoko had a fight
But they were able to make up
When I see them, I think, it's so cool to have a family
I think it doesn't matter if it's Guld or a person
When it comes to a mother and a child
It's nothing new
But I didn't understand it until my body changed
I wish everyone understood it
The relationship between Nishio and Kimi
can serve as an example of what can happen between a person and Guld
That's what I think
Then why did you come?
Well
I shouldn't have said that
I didn't know anything about you and Yoriko
I'm sorry
Okay, I'll tell the boss
I think Toko also wants
people to accept her
But if they reject her when she reveals herself
There will be no way back
It also concerns us and Hideo
How's your sister?
No changes
I hope she'll get better soon
Yeah
Let's continue
How does it read?
Well
It says rain here
Rain?
It's a very heavy rain
Hinami?
Oh, mom
Are you learning to read?
Yes
As always, thank you
You're welcome
Well, I'll go
Thank you, brother
See you tomorrow
Yeah
Look, mom
I learned all the kanji from this book
Really?
You're good
By the way, mom
Yeah?
I want a new book
Huh?
I want to learn more words to surprise dad
Besides, his birthday is coming soon
So you want to give him a book?
Then let's go get it
Yeah
Thank you very much
It looks like it's going to rain
Really? It's raining
See? I told you
Yeah
Oh, mom
What?
It's called a rain
A rain?
When it's heavy rain, it's called a rain
That's what my brother told me
Kaneki is very smart, isn't he?
Yeah
I wonder if dad knows
Let's ask him
If I know something that dad doesn't know, it's cool, isn't it?
Yeah
What's wrong with you?
We haven't walked together for so long
Wait, Hinami, you'll get wet
Hinami, let's go home
Mom
What about the other store?
Hey
Mom
I forgot to do something
Hinami
Dad
Mom, dad is somewhere near
It can't be
He came to us
Hey, Hinami
Come here, mom
Hinami, wait
Dad
Wait
Dad
Wait
Hinami
Hinami
It's dad's smell
Hinami
Dad
Dad
Hinami
What's that smell?
It's a good rain, isn't it?
But I don't want it to get worse
Otherwise, I won't hear your death screams
Can I have a word with you, Ms. Fuyaguchi?
Mom
Mom
Wow
Hinami
Run
Mom
Everything is fine
You'll come back to Anteika first
And I'll come back a little later
No
No
I'll stay with you

The following is the continuation.
Hey, Nishiki!
Yes?
We'll wear them together.
What?
They're called bracelets.
The same.
Nonsense.
And she wants to wear it?
Okay, it's just a gift.
Damn, they look like horse shit.
What?
Horse shit?
Okay, stop.
Kimie, I think you have a good taste.
Dull.
