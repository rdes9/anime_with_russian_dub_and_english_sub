Got it. Thank you very much.
Good luck.
Next one, please.
Help!
Knock-knock.
Finally found you.
I'm Mori?
I lost the tool you made.
I need a new one.
All right.
All right. See you later.
My dear.
I love you.
I love you too.
I love you too.
I love you too.
Easy. Don't rush.
Do it calmly.
All right.
How is it?
I can't even compare with you, Chef.
Coffee has a certain taste.
It depends on the effort you put in.
There are no visitors yet, so don't rush.
All right.
There is one important thing.
Anteika is an unusual cafe.
Here, gulis from the entire 20th district meet with their brothers.
Ordinary people also come in.
Like you once.
Oh, gulis hide their true appearance, don't they?
And they serve people.
You need to know more about people to survive in their world.
For us, gulis, people are like textbooks.
And still, I like them.
Well, I think it's time to help Tokio.
Yeah.
Loves people.
I wonder what you mean.
Then another time.
Hi, Kaneki.
Hide? What are you doing here?
Dumbass.
I came to thank Tokio.
To thank?
She saved us after an accident.
What?
He's like new.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
I see.
I heard Nisho is still in the hospital.
We only got hurt because of you, Tokio.
Thank you.
Okay, Kaneki, see you.
Bye.
Thanks for the visit.
Make sure he doesn't know we're gulis.
Yeah, sure.
If he finds out who we really are,
I'll have to kill him.
What?
If you value his life, keep it a secret.
Welcome.
Tokio.
Ms. Ryoko, bring the towel.
Coming.
Sorry for the inconvenience.
It's empty.
I haven't seen Hinami in a while.
Hinami.
Where's Yoshimura?
Upstairs.
Kaneki, give her a new towel.
Here you go.
Thanks a lot.
What's this?
Are they gulis?
This is Ms. Fuyaguchi,
who's going to take something from us.
Take what?
It's a long story.
What story?
Listen, you're sick of it!
Not at all!
Not at all?
Didn't the boss tell you?
Packages?
Take a walk with the big suitcases.
This is the 11th district on the screen.
It looks like they've started
to gather in groups.
Apparently,
they're getting ready to attack.
I've got everything.
Can anyone add anything?
Kataramon, detective of the first rank.
Let's start with this one.
I'm sure everyone knows
that three months ago,
Jason from the 13th district
got in touch with Guli Mabzora
from the 20th rank.
It was found at the crime scene.
And what is it?
Apparently, it's Guli's tool.
After studying it,
we found out that he's out of the league.
I see.
Jason's goal is unknown at the moment.
However,
I would like to say
that after their contact,
I'm sure he deserves special attention.
Something is brewing in the 20th district.
As expected
from the best student of the academy.
You're lucky, Mado.
With such a partner,
you will have more time for games.
Fortunately, yes.
If you had finished this meeting earlier,
I would have spent much more time
in a more productive way.
You're talkative as always.
Okay, Mado and Amon,
the 20th district is waiting for you.
Got it?
Yes.
I think now
any activity of Guli
in the quiet districts
will be a prelude to something big.
But we, CCG,
are obliged to destroy every Guli in Tokyo.
This is our main and only goal.
And we will not change it.
And now for business.
Got it.
The meeting is closed.
Everybody is free.
Whatever it is,
now the 20th district is entrusted to us.
Yes.
And we have only one clue.
That's enough.
We have already grasped the end of the thread.
We just need to follow it
until we get to the end.
Yes.
The 20th district.
Mr. Mado?
Yes.
Gurman, Abjura and Jason.
Try it.
Chef, it's inedible.
Are you okay?
The bread tastes like a sponge.
And the cheese feels like
I'm stuffed with clay.
Well,
a very funny comment.
The secret is that
to swallow without chewing,
you need to pretend that you chew
after swallowing,
and then pretend that you swallow the food.
Be sure to spit it out
before swallowing.
Otherwise, it will affect your health.
Kaneki,
once you have trained,
you will be able to have lunch with your friend again.
I'll try.
I have a gift for you.
Sugar in cubes?
It's not really sugar.
Throw it in coffee,
and then drink it.
It will help to quench the hunger.
What is it made of?
You'd better not know that.
But with him...
By the way,
Kaneki,
can you stay today?
Yes, of course.
Usually I ask for Toku,
but today she is preparing for the tests.
Today you will cook food
instead of her.
Cook food?
I will not kill!
No, you don't have to kill.
Anteikus supplies food
to those of us
who cannot hunt.
You understand how important it is.
Yes,
if we don't hunt.
Okay,
can you call me Yoma?
This is Mr. Yoma.
How to understand
how to cook food?
For hens who cannot hunt.
It looks like he's about a couple
that came in the morning.
Here we are.
It's high.
What are we?
Don't lean on it.
You will die.
He's alive.
There are some suicides here.
There are so many corpses.
It seems that
people in Anteik are eating
the meat of the suicides.
Calm down.
What?
I'm sorry, Mr. Mado.
I didn't see it.
Your feelings, Amon,
use them.
And now
a familiar thing.
What?
I'll ask again.
Have you seen this toy before?
No, I haven't seen it.
What is it?
I don't know.
What is it?
I don't know.
I haven't seen it.
What is it?
What?
Mask, you say?
Yes.
I think it won't hurt you.
I see.
Toka.
Yes?
Will you go with Kaneki to the dressing room tomorrow?
What?
I have the only day off.
Why should I spend it with him?
Kaneki himself will not cope.
I want to let him go alone.
I agree.
But he already has one.
Toka.
Two hunters have appeared in the area.
Pigeons?
Pigeons?
They are already acting.
In the extreme case, he will need help.
I see.
Hey, Pavyazochka.
Tomorrow at half past three at the station.
If you're late, I'll kill you.
Hey!
What for?
We have pretty girls.
Get off, you moron!
Mr. Uta!
Is anyone home?
Damn.
Is he asleep?
Boo!
What are you doing, Mr. Uta?
I wanted to scare you.
This is Mr. Uta. He makes masks.
I'm Uta.
Kaneki.
You smell strange.
Toka, I heard the pigeons have appeared.
Yes.
It's always quiet in our area.
So they decided to check everything.
It looks like it's all because of Riz.
It looks like Tsukiyama has learned her fate.
Yeah, I know.
So the 20th district is considered calm?
I didn't know.
You live for a long time, you know a lot.
If you want, I'll spend the night here.
If you're lucky, you'll see Roshchlenenka.
It's very fun.
No, thank you.
It's good that there are places like Antayko.
Sit there.
I'll take measurements.
Do you have an allergy?
No, on rubber or metal.
Nothing like that.
Do you want it all over your face?
Well, I think it will go down to the face.
Oh, a beautiful bandage.
Do you like it?
Well, when I'm hungry,
my eyes turn red and I can't do anything about it.
Then just don't starve.
Do you want a treat?
No, thank you.
Kaneki, do you have a girlfriend?
Actually, no.
So you prefer older ladies to girls of your age?
Excuse me, will these questions help you somehow?
They will.
I'll do everything right,
knowing more about you.
How do you like Toka?
She scares me.
Scares you?
I see.
For me, she's a real laborer.
You say laborer?
For us living in the shadow of society,
we need a mask that we don't have to take off.
Pricing every moment of our lives,
we should not stand out so much
that no one will suspect anything.
She lives understanding this risk.
She works at Anteika
and even goes to school.
Why is she so close to people?
Good question.
But among my clients
there are also ordinary people.
And I like to pretend to be a person.
It's fun.
So you're a laborer?
I'm nothing.
Toka!
What?
Tell me, what happened to Hinami?
She gave up on you.
I just want to know.
I want to know.
I want to know
if I can help.
Now she doesn't live with her father.
That's why she's so worried.
But she's always like that.
I see.
Oh, yes.
Toka, tell me, why do you need this mask?
What? You don't even know this?
Not at all.
Oh, boss.
Pigeons.
They're so-called hunters.
You can't show your face
when you're faced with them.
That's why Mr. Uta made a mask for you.
Damn it.
Damn it.
Disgusting.
Do you know this thing?
What?
What about you?
I don't know. It's the first time I see it.
Are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure.
Thank you for your cooperation.
Let's go, Amon.
Let's look somewhere else.
Yes, I agree.
Okay.
I'm sorry.
I'm...
I'm sorry.
So you caught her for food.
You can't do that, Kaneki.
Girls don't like that.
There you go.
Here.
Give it to her and apologize.
I'm sorry.
Hinami, can I come in?
Yes.
I'm sorry about the other day.
This is an apology.
Enjoy.
Um...
What is it?
Um...
Are you my brother?
Oh, well...
I'm sorry.
You're not like everyone else.
If you were like us, I'd understand.
See?
A lot has happened.
You're not Gullia's organs.
So if that's the case,
I'm almost the same as you, Hinami.
You can say I have the body of Gullia,
but I think I'm like a human.
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have asked.
It's okay.
Oh, a beautiful drawing.
What kind of animal is it?
It's my dad.
Very beautiful.
So it's your dad.
No, it's nothing.
I hope you'll live together again.
Yes.
Is that a black and white rainbow?
Yes.
Hinami, do you read Takatsuki?
Amazingly, considering the complexity of his books.
Although there are also simple short stories.
What's your favorite book?
Well,
The Twilight Rain.
The Twilight Rain?
Oh,
The Rain on the Sunset.
It's a prototype of the story about a black goat and an egg.
A prototype?
The Rain on the Sunset?
How do you read it?
Hortensia.
Hortensia?
Is that a flower?
Yes.
How do you read it?
It's read as thin ice.
And it means ice.
Ice?
But sometimes it's read as ice.
It even sounds better, doesn't it?
Yes.
Hortensia.
Well done.
The Rain on the Sunset.
You even pronounce it correctly.
I don't want to go to school,
so I write down what I learned here.
I see.
Hortensia,
do you want me to teach you such words?
Really?
Yes.
Thank you, brother.
How do you read it?
It's...
What?
Hortensia in the 20th district?
Today is not your day.
Yes, the 20th district is no longer safe.
Damn, it hurts.
Someone was in a hurry to reinforce here,
so he must have already been killed.
No, I'm not lucky with others.
Damn, it hurts.
Shut up, huh?
I would go to Dr. Foyaguchi already.
The best way to track the waste
is to use the same one.
Yes.
I wonder
what the hell will be inside it.
Good morning, everyone!
Good morning!
It's not worth it again!
Good morning, brother!
Hello to you too, Hinami.
Why are you smiling, fool?
Go to work!
Welcome!
Yes,
a wonderful aroma.
It's getting
easier here,
indeed.
Let's continue.
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
See ya touchy
See ya touchy
Look, sister, there's a bird, it looks like it's lost.
It doesn't look good, we need to help it.
Sister, why are you running away? Wait!
Sister, wait!
I'm scared, bird.
Maybe we should give it a name?
They'll come for it soon.
But...
We'll fry it.
Sister.
Next, dinner.
