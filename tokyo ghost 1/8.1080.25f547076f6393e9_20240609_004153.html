        <pre>So we'll split up?
Yes.
That's a big one.
Rabbit number 745.
We'll catch both of them and that's it.
Are they going to show up?
I'm sure of it.
Okay.
Okay, let's go.
What is it, Mr. Mada?
You'd better not know.
Mom!
Toka!
Where have you been?
It's none of your business.
If I can help you with something...
What?
You're not going to help me here.
Hinami?
Hinami!
Why?
Hinami!
Hinami!
Hinami!
Hinami!
Hinami!
Hinami!
Hinami!
Hinami!
Hinami!
Hinami!
Hinami!
Hinami!
Hinami!

I don't want to hurt you in the world that someone else has created
Remember my heart
Hinami
Tuka
Damn, there's no one here either. What about you?
Where is she?
Really?
Where are we?
Here, her mother
Hinami
There's no one else
Next to her
Where is she?
Tuka?
It's...
That guy
Bad news
Hinami
It's a rarity
It's a rabbit
Who the hell are you?
Hinami
Hinami, what is this?
It's my mother
Let's go, Hinami
It's dangerous here
No
Why can't we live in peace?
I want to see my mother
Take me away
Take me to her
Please
Hinami
I miss her
I want to see her
Hinami
Rabbit friend?
I don't need you
Get out of the way
I won't
Are you healed already, Rabbit?
Rabbit
Did you really hope to have a hunter like me with such a cheap trick?
Like a child
By the way, how did you like my present?
I'm sure you missed your mother
Bastard
Don't mess with me
You can't
You can't let him go
That's why I...
Got up?
Then...
I see you want to play
Jump
Jump, little bug
Your weapon is useless here
You can't
You can't
You can't
You can't
You can't
Your weapon is useless here
I've always been surprised by someone like you
You're hunting people instinctively, devouring them
Why do you even exist?
Children whose parents were killed
Sorrow of those who were abandoned
Loneliness
Have you ever thought about it?
Answer
Do you even understand what it's like
To live in fear all the time
When your loved ones are being crushed like worms
Do you know this feeling?
No
The rabbit killed my friend
Why was he killed?
Because he's an investigator?
Because he's a human?
Bullshit
What did he deserve to die for?
Tell me, what did Mrs. Ryoko deserve to die for?
This world is wrong
It's all because of people like you
If it wasn't for you...
Die!
So, did you get it now?
This is yours
Your beloved
Mommy
My tool is made of your kagune
Bastard!
The ghouls ruined this world
Is that really true?
Why did you kill Mrs. Ryoko?
And Hinami?
She lost her loved one too
Isn't Hinami the same?
The ghouls have feelings too
Just like people
Why won't people understand this?
Why don't they want to understand?
It's obvious
It's so easy to understand
I'm the only one
The only one who can understand
Who can tell everyone
Only me and the ghoul
And the human
There's no one else
You're wrong
The world itself
Is not right at all
I don't argue
Many ghouls have chosen the wrong path
But not all of them are the same
We need to learn more
About people
About ghouls
Not only ghouls make the wrong world
People too
What are you talking about?
Don't you understand?
If that's the case
I'll explain
Great material comes out of you
But this thing is really amazing
Combination of your mom and dad's parts
Gives an incredible effect
Stop it!
So
Which end should I take first?
I'll kill you
Damn old man!
Watch your tongue
Stop it!
How do I explain it to him?
How do I make him understand?
We shouldn't fight
We shouldn't kill each other
Ghouls
Should break the chain of suffering
How do I do that?
What should I do?
Enough!
I have no time to talk to you
Bastard!
You can't let him go
If I could do something
But I'm too weak
Right
This is my only way out
Then
Now
Just once
I'll let out the one who's inside me
Mrs. Risa
Help!
Looks like
Hunger is rising
I need to fight it somehow
But I haven't forgotten
What?
Who am I?
Who am I?
Blocking blows?
With this power
Stop fooling around
Now
He won't be able to fight
I'm unarmed
No
When there's an enemy in front of you
Even if you lose your arm and leg
Run
And if you fall
I'll kill you for sure
So
Run!
What else?
I won't run away from Ghouls
Faster!
Run!
I'm begging you
Don't force me
To kill myself
What would you do
In our place?
What's wrong
With the desire to live?
What if you
Could eat so many people?
How would you live without thinking about them?
How?
We'd die
We'd die
We'd die
We'd die
All together
I just
Want to live the same way
As you
I'm sick of you
Get ready to die
No!
To the tool?
The tool?
Disappeared?
No
My right arm disappeared
Hinami
No
Don't hurt my sister
Don't use it anymore
Mom and dad
Don't use it anymore
Cool
Unbelievable
You really inherited better than your mom and dad
I want
Give it to me
Hinami
Finish him
I can't
He's the one
Who killed your parents
I don't care anymore
I don't want
To live
Together
I don't want
To live
Together
I don't want
I
I'm just very sad
Mom and dad
I miss them
Mom
Dad
Now I'm all alone
Unbelievable
She needs to be a family
If so
She will replace my tool
Here we are
As if your view is worthy of living
Don't laugh
Not yet
I haven't destroyed you yet
Not yet
I didn't get to this
One-eyed
And didn't finish him
I
Can't
Die
This gul
Why didn't he kill me?
He was crying
Damn
I can't hold on
No
Somebody help
Meat
I want meat
No
I need to do something
Who are you?
Now
I'm fucking hungry
Do you understand?
I think I understand why you were so interested in Mr. Yashimuro
Now I myself wonder what will come of you
Go home
Ken
Mr. Yoma
Yoma
What did I do?
Eat
It will make you feel better
He put on gloves
Are we so
Disgusting?
Hinami
Toga
Toga
Is it true?
It's true
I can
Live
Hinami
I think Mrs. Ryoko wanted you to live
I think

Text read by Orica and Jam
We'll hear more
To be continued
I didn't even think I'd end up like this
It's all Amon's fault
I wonder what's waiting for me in heaven
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
Even though you'm sorry
I'm sorry
I am

I'm really sorry
