Why did you do it? I will not eat a human!
I'm a human, not a monster like you!
Oh, if I'm a monster, then who are you?
Please tell me what to do!
Since that day, my life has been bad!
Bad, you mean? I have a question for you.
What kind of cake does cake taste like?
Tell me, what kind of cake does cake taste like?
Personally, I hate it so much that I want to spit it out. But people love them, don't they?
What is it like to live carelessly?
To live without being afraid of the military and other hooligans?
Life sucks! Don't laugh!
It turns out that I am so self-born. What do you say? Answer me!
I was broken, I was broken.
In this world, you laugh.
Without seeing anything.
I was broken, I was broken.
In this world, you laugh.
Without seeing anything.
I was broken, I was broken.
In this world, you laugh.
I was broken, I was broken.
In this world, you laugh.
In this world, you laugh.
I was broken, I was broken.
In this world, you laugh.
In this world, you laugh.
I am... I am a human!
That's right, you're not a ghoul, but you're not a human.
Such half-bloods don't live long!
I... I...
If you want to be a human so much, you should starve to death.
But I warn you, hunger for ghouls is hell.
That's enough of him.
Chef!
You look bad, follow me.
But why, Chef?
Only...
We have to help our brothers.
I'm sorry for the delay.
Please.
Don't you like coffee?
No, just...
Look closely at this coffee, Kaneki.
What do you think?
It looks delicious.
This is regular coffee.
Delicious, very delicious.
But any food tastes disgusting.
For centuries, coffee is the only thing that ghouls can enjoy like people.
But it can't completely quench our hunger.
Therefore...
What's this?
If you want more, come, don't be shy.
Why are you helping him, Chef?
Only...
Remember, recently on TV they talked about organ transplant surgery?
Two students were hit by a falling metal bar.
The doctor transplanted the organs of the deceased girl to the surviving boy.
But the girl who died was...
Risa.
Then he...
Yes, that guy.
His organs were transplanted to him.
It can't be.
I've never seen anything like this before.
But now his body is in a very bad condition.
Blood. Blood. Blood. Blood. Blood. Blood. Blood. Blood. Blood.
You're not a ghoul, but you're not a human.
These half-bloods don't live long.
Miku!
Who are you worried about?
I'm worried about you.
I'm worried about you.
I'm worried about you.
Miku!
Who are you worried about?
Are you a half-blood or not?
You're not a human.
You're not a ghoul.
You are you.
Be proud of who you are.
Delicious meat is waiting for you.
It's so delicious, so worrying.
Once you try, you won't stop.
Any steak is resting here.
Come on, break it.
It's a big rarity.
It's a big rarity.
Adhide, are you alive there?
Adhide!
Did you go to the confectionery near the station?
They have a lot of snacks.
What would you like, Kaneki?
How long can you walk?
Imagine what I had.
Even rabbits die of loneliness.
I'm sorry, Hideo.
What's the bandage?
It's a fashion.
I was very bored until you were gone.
I'm sorry.
How many years has it been?
It seems it's not the first time.
Hey, Kaneki!
How long can you walk?
Imagine what I had.
Hey, are you listening to me, Kaneki?
I'm sorry.
What did you say?
Whatever.
I need to take something from one senior with a sharp tongue.
Will you come with me?
Are you eating well, Kaneki?
What?
You are very pale.
You need to eat more.
It was always like that.
Hideo immediately feels similar things.
He is very worried about the mood of others.
But he pretends that he doesn't notice anything,
so that I don't worry.
If I stop being a human,
we will never be friends again.
I want to meet you, Kaneki.
With Nishio?
Well, yes.
How can I say?
He seems to be a swindler, and it's a little uncomfortable next to him.
No!
They came.
Sorry for the intrusion.
Hideo, knock.
Legs.
Didn't you learn to knock?
It's Nishio's fault.
Most of all, I hate when someone climbs on my territory.
Yes, this is my friend Kaneki, who I told about.
I see.
I'm Nishio Nishiki,
a second-grader from the pharmaceutical industry.
Nice to meet you, Kaneki.
So you came for the record?
Yes, I need a last-year record.
Damn, where is she?
Probably he is at home.
Are you kidding?
Legs, maybe we'll run after him?
To your home?
Well, yes.
Well, let's go.
Sorry, Kaneki, I need to go with Nishio, so come back alone.
Hideo.
Can I come with you?
What are you doing?
Okay, I don't mind.
I won't let you go home anyway.
Oh, okay.
Excuse me, an important call.
What's wrong with you?
Nothing.
Legs.
Oh, what?
Did you see a lot recently?
Why are there so many hens around me?
No.
Hens have always been around.
I just didn't notice it.
Will you?
Oh, I won't refuse.
Welcome.
Take a seat.
Here you go.
Oh, shit.
Here you go.
Thank you very much.
Kaneki, are you a member of the committee?
Yes.
I'm not a very good organizer.
I see.
A complete opposite of the hens, then.
Can hens eat something like this?
Very tasty.
Tasty and crispy.
Kaneki, why don't you eat?
I'll eat later.
He's very adapted and really looks like an ordinary student.
Impressive.
I'm sure no one can guess that he's a hens.
It's going to be bad.
It's going to be bad if they see us.
Hide!
So we have another hens in our university.
You're disgusting.
You're being carried away by hens.
Let me guess.
You wanted to eat a hens?
Nothing makes you feel better.
Nothing makes you feel better.
What do you see in the eyes of the one who trusted you the most, Kaneki?
Kaneki!
I'm not like you.
I see.
I can't stand it when Gull teaches me less than me.
It's really annoying.
You know why?
You're a real hens.
You remind me of tofu.
Ugh, disgusting.
Damn, how do people eat this shit?
As if you ate horse shit.
I'm sorry, Kaneki.
I accidentally soiled your food.
You've known each other for a long time, haven't you?
Best friends?
When were you going to eat it?
Tell me, Kaneki, what would you eat first?
Hide, not food.
Take your leg away.
What exactly?
Stop it!
You decided to hit me with a bag?
Are you a woman?
You really didn't understand anything, did you?
For Gull, people are just food, like cows and pigs.
Or do you enjoy playing with friends who are nothing more than food?
Is it fun?
I don't play!
I see.
I'll be honest, you shouldn't be friends with a peddler.
That guy is not a fool.
Even you should understand that he will always be in danger next to you.
And besides...
You can't even control your eyes.
Well, get up.
Or kill the peddler first.
Oh, what was that?
Here, take it.
I think that's enough for you.
Even Kaguna didn't use it.
I can't beat him.
Hide.
HIDE!
Oh, you got up.
Hurry up, or I'll crush him.
Did you break out?
You saved me again.
Goodbye, peddler.
No.
Don't!
Don't!
So you're always reading books at school?
Can't I?
Why?
I came here because I don't have any friends either.
So let's be friends, huh?
Come on.
Great! I'm HIDEYOSHI, a peddler.
Just call me HIDE.
Nice to meet you.
Yeah, nice to meet you, HIDE.
Even when no one talked to me in class,
HIDE worried and was kind to me.
No.
I don't want HIDE...
to die!
That's...
That's impossible!
Damn it!
Stop it!
Stop it, you idiot!
I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die!
That's...
RIZIN!
Damn it!
HIDE
Oh, it's so delicious!
It smells so good.
I want to eat it.
Hey, look closely.
It's delicious, right?
Stop it.
HIDE is not food.
Are you sure?
Look closely.
See?
Do you agree?
Yeah, I agree.
You're gonna lick my fingers.
Stop it, stop it!
What are you talking about?
You want to eat it, don't you?
You don't have to resist.
There's nothing wrong with that.
Hurry up.
Do what you want.
What do I want?
It's...
all yours.
All?
Come on.
You're right.
It's my special dish.
I...
have to eat it.
HIDE
My friend!
Yeah, he's my friend,
and I have to eat it.
I have to eat it!
You're getting more and more like us,
you fool.
So, you took the pigeon up?
Go away!
You don't even bother
about your friend's life.
You know what?
You're gonna regret it
if you tear this guy up.
In a puddle of blood and insides.
That's how hungry Gulia is.
And that's our destiny.
You're really bothering me.
I'll figure it out one day.
So, let's get this over with.
Toka brought you here.
Where's Hide?
Follow me.
Hide!
All this time
I've been suffering from hunger.
If I recall,
at that moment I was so hungry
that I could barely stand up.
In the end, even Hide...
But then it all fell apart.
I have blood in my mouth.
Tell me the truth.
What did you do
while I was on the run?
There is only one way
to quench the hunger of Gulia.
You understand, don't you?
Continue it,
and you'd eat your friend.
You have to understand
who you are.
I...
I don't want to hurt my friend.
That means
I can't be with him anymore.
But in the world,
I don't have a place for Gulia.
Being neither a human nor a Gulia,
I'm not destined to be alone.
There's no place for me
anywhere else.
You're wrong.
You are both a human and a Gulia.
You are the one
who can live in both worlds.
Stay in Anteika.
I'm sure you can find
the path you should follow.
Besides,
I want you to know
about us better.
Did we really
find the merciless monsters?
What do you say?
How about learning how to brew
aromatic coffee first?
Well...
Do you think I can do it?
It's a good rain, isn't it?
The rain dampens
their feelings.
It's perfect for work.
According to the report
of the 20th district detachment,
there was an incident three months ago.
They believe that
Abzhor was in this building,
and there are eyewitnesses
who saw Jason here.
Abzhor and Jason?
S-level creatures?
Who knows?
I doubt they just had a peaceful lunch.
Mr. Mado?
Mr. Mado!
Amon!
See? I told you!
The only drawback
of this rain
is that I can't hear
the voices of death.
