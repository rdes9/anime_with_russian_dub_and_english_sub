Mom?
Mom?
Mrs. Riza?
Long time no see, Kaneki.
What happened?
Were you tortured?
That's great.
Looks like the master is back.
How many did you count?
Five hundred...
Fifty...
Nine!
I want this bucket to be full.
Yamori forced me to count back from a thousand to seven.
At first I didn't understand why.
But everything became clear when I got there.
What was it for?
That's why I did it.
Five hundred!
Meanwhile, Yamori continued to pull out my nails.
Again and again.
Again and again.
Again and again.
Again and again.
And again.
Every time.
Every time.
Every time.
Every time.
Again and again.
Every time.
When my fingers, hands and feet healed,
I realized that I was becoming a monster.
Good morning.
Mrs. Riza, are you alive?
It doesn't matter, does it?
By the way, Kaneki, what was your mother like?
You told me about her recently.
Is that her?
Is that her?
I'm not at home.
Welcome back.
Is that you, Kaneki?
Listen, Mom!
Aren't you beautiful?
What's written here?
What are you doing?
She always wrote down and explained how every Kanji is pronounced,
which I couldn't read.
Where is she going?
To work.
To work.
What's here?
My father's office.
What was he like?
I don't know.
He died when I was barely born.
I just fell in love with books,
because I always read my father's books.
And weren't you lonely?
No, I read my father's books.
And my mother was always kind to me.
Is that so?
She was amazing.
She always cleaned the house, despite work.
I've never seen her sad.
Or that she would scold me.
She was very kind.
I was proud of my mother.
Ken, it's okay to be sad.
You can't die a good boy.
Yes.
It's better to suffer yourself than to hurt others.
It's enough for good people.
That's what she taught me.
She was so amazing.
That's why you're here.
You're good, Kaneki.
Do you know why you're so interested in me?
I don't know if you know or not,
but your regeneration is very unusual.
It's all thanks to Kana's experiment.
He made you a golem using rice.
One eye and smell of rice.
I made you a golem.
I'm talking about you, Kaneki.
Did you hear about the Chinese rhino?
I want to put it in your ear.
Don't you mind?
No.
Please, don't.
Please, don't.
Please, don't.
Oh, my God.
It's so interesting.
I want to kill you and eat you.
Kill, kill, kill.
Can I kill you?
Can I eat you?
Can I do it?
Can I eat you?
Kill me.
Kill me.
Kill me.
Kill me.
Kill me.
Please, kill me.
It's better to suffer yourself than to hurt others.
Did you really believe in it?
Well, my mom told me, so...
Did you do what they told you to do?
Seriously?
Stop it.
Don't you want to kill him?
Are you sure your mom was really as nice as you think?
And what's this?
Money.
For whom?
For my mom's sister.
She always claimed that she lived a poor life and asked her mom for money.
She was abusing her money.
Work during the day, cleaning the trash at night.
And her household duties.
She only did what she did.
Mom, are you all right?
I'm fine.
And then?
And then...
And then...
She died.
After that, I was left alone.
I didn't have a home anymore.
Hey, Kaneki!
How long can you walk?
Damn it.
That's right.
I could only walk in one place.
Kaneki, be a good boy.
You could eat a second-class yushikawa.
Your favorite.
And something else.
And I don't like it very much.
Hideo was the only one who supported me.
He's a good friend, isn't he?
But you're going to lose him, aren't you?
It's your own fault.
All the shortcomings in this world appear because of the lack of talent.
The man who told me this was a real piece of shit.
But now I am very grateful to him.
Kaneki...
For the last few days, I've realized something.
Like your body, your mind is also very strong.
That's why I came up with something.
Let's have fun with a couple who love each other.
You choose yourself who to kill.
I let them take care of you.
You've been waiting for help all this time, haven't you?
Have you seen your saviors in these two?
So who?
If you don't choose, I'll kill both of them.
I'll repeat.
Which of them will you save?
Why me?
Why me?
Why do I have to choose?
Come on, choose faster.
I can't do that.
Isn't it the same as killing yourself?
Choose, choose, choose.
Faster.
Boy?
Girl?
Right or left?
Choose.
I can't choose.
Do you want to kill?
Kill me.
Okay, as you wish.
Look closely.
Her?
What about her?
Or not?
Come on, choose.
Choose.
She will die.
Come on, Kaneki.
Faster, faster.
Choose.
What's your choice?
Well?
Come on.
Choose me, Kaneki.
He will kill her.
Me.
Choose me, Kaneki.
It seems to be broken.
It's all your fault.
It's not mine.
No.
It's me.
It's my fault.
And how did you decide that?
You're just doing what you're sitting here and blaming yourself.
Only self-pity will not change anything.
You don't want to change.
It's all your fault.
Do you understand this?
Who's to blame for what happened before?
It's coincidence, chance, fate.
However, there is no concept of fate.
It's just a combination of several circumstances.
And who creates them?
Who?
You.
You yourself.
All the shortcomings in this world appear because of the lack of talent.
He's right.
It all started because you didn't know the know-how of this world.
You were stupid then.
So I led you.
The doctor repaired you.
And you became a monster.
It's all your fault.
It's better to suffer yourself than to harm others.
That's why it happened to you.
If you were strong and killed Yemori, these two would have survived.
Choose a guy.
Maybe you would save a girl.
If you were only strong then.
Mrs. Arioka.
Mrs. Arioka.
Stop it!
It will be different.
Only...
Hinami.
And the one you value.
Hide!
Monster.
No, I...
Why didn't you tell me?
You couldn't choose again.
And it happened.
Who?
See?
This is the life you chose.
This is your future.
Why are you crying?
Why are you crying?
You decided to suffer yourself, not to harm others.
You are very kind and kind.
But when it turned out that you would choose both, you left them.
Your mother was the same.
If she hadn't spent it for her sister, she wouldn't have died of exhaustion.
Shut up.
What a stupid mother.
If she really loved you, she should have forgotten about her stupid sister.
Stop it.
In fact, you wanted this from her.
Shut up.
To mom.
To mom.
Why?
Why did you leave me?
I miss her so much.
I hate being alone.
I want you to choose me.
I want you to live for me.
And leave your aunt?
Even if so.
Even if you hurt others?
Even if so.
Even if you have to kill her?
Even if so.
Good boy.
Right, Kaneki?
Sometimes you have to give up one thing to save another.
Your mother didn't do that.
It's not kindness.
It's just weakness.
She didn't have the strength to reject her.
You still don't want to hurt anyone?
Will you forgive someone like Yamori?
No.
I won't forgive him.
If there are more members of Aogiri, they will certainly attack the 20th district.
I won't let that happen.
Your precious friend and comrades from Anteiku may also have the same test as you.
I will kill anyone who wants to get rid of me.
Do you have enough strength?
Enough.
So you accept me?
No.
Nothing like that.
I will surpass you anytime.
Even if it gets worse?
I'm not wrong.
This whole world is wrong.
This is enough, Kaneki.
Live by devouring others.
Eat.
I am...
Gull.
Kaneki.
Our precious time is almost over.
The pigeons are almost here.
You see, I have to kill them.
Members of Aogiri kill anyone on their way.
These are people, of course, but so are the gulls.
The gulls are now opposed to the Aogiri.
Those with whom you work in Anteiku, if I'm not mistaken.
Their members of Aogiri are also going to be destroyed.
Kaneki.
Let me take advantage of you.
I will devour every particle of your memory.
How fun.
Are you really that stupid?
You're really something.
Now give it to me.
Eat this.
Terrible taste.
You...
Me?
What?
Bitten?
Tastes like rotten fish guts.
I won't let you!
Do you think after all I've gone through, it will do something to me?
I'll kill you!
I'll kill you!
I'll kill you!
I'll kill you!
I'll kill you!
I'll kill you!
I'll kill you!
I'll kill you!
I'll devour you!
I'll turn you into a bunch of cockroaches!
I'll kill you!
I'll bite you to death!
Kaneki!
Kaneki!
Now...
It's my turn.
I'll devour you!
I'll devour you!
I'll devour you!
I'll devour you!
