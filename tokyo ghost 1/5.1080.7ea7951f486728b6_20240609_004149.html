        <pre>Mr. Tsukiyama, thank God! Mr. Tsukiyama, help me!
Kaneki, bon appetit!
Please tell me, please tell me
The way you do it
Please tell me, please tell me
The way you do it
Who is inside me?
It's broken, it's broken
In this world
You smile
Without seeing anything
The way you do it
Who is inside me?
It's broken, it's broken
In this world
You smile
Without seeing anything
The way you do it
Who is inside me?
It's broken, it's broken
In this world
You smile
Without seeing anything
The way you do it
Who is inside me?
It's broken, it's broken
In this world
You smile
Without seeing anything
The way you do it
Who is inside me?
It's broken, it's broken
In this world

She's not feeling well today
Maybe you can visit her?
I... but...
She's upstairs, right above you
Kirishima Ayato?
I'm going
Take care of her, okay?
Hinami, help your sister too
Hello
Hi
You
Why are you here?
I heard you're not feeling well
So I decided to visit you
With empty hands?
Well, I...
Brother, what's written here?
Huh? Where?
It says
Orange Esmantus
It's a flower, right?
I'm going to get some coffee
I'll do it myself
Forget it, you're helping Hinami
But you're not feeling well
I just ate too much
You ate too much?
Really?
No
No
No
Yoriko?
Why is she here?
Yoriko
What happened?
I'm sorry I didn't invite you
But you weren't at school
Were you worried?
Yes
What else?
What?
Toka, is it really him?
His name is Kaneki
He...
Toka
I cooked it for you
Eat together
Wait, you don't understand
Hey, Yoriko
Did I do something wrong?
Where are you putting it?
I'll eat
She did it for me
I don't think you can eat that much
Enjoy your meal
She's expensive
What should I do?
What should I do?
What should I do to enjoy the taste of Kaneki?
I have an idea
The indescribable enjoyment
requires a third person
in a magnificent place
And when Kaneki's music
reaches its peak
it will be incredible
Fortissimo
Oh, Kaneki
He's barely alive
Mr. Uyama is too weak
Nishio?
What? Maybe we should start with the hand?
Hooray!
Nishio is just like me
Excuse me
Don't you think
we overdid it?
Kaneki-ken?
Hey, is this shit your chicken?
No, I didn't say that
Then maybe you can leave?
We'll just eat it
Will you eat it?
What?
Are you kidding me?
He's much slower than Uyama
It's time to check the results of the training
Bastard!
He hit me
I wish you the same, Sviatosha
Is it here?
Nishiki!
Where have you been?
You've been beaten up again
I want to die
Don't do it, Kimi
But he's...
Right
He's the bastard
who made a hole in my stomach
Kimi, you're a human, aren't you?
Why are you with Gulyam?
I want to be with him
Even if Nishio kills people?
Until he kills my friends
and touches my family
I'll be able to close my eyes
He still needs the corpses
I see
Kaneki!
Can you help Nishiki?
If he doesn't eat the flesh
then I'm sure
What should I do?
Kimi
I'll think of something
Thank you
I have to...
hold on
I have to believe in you, Kaneki
Good evening, mademoiselle
I need your help in one thing
Don't open it
It turns out that if people
want to be with Gulyam
even if they're still alive
Rose and a note?
I know who the author is
Kaneki
I'm inviting you to the trapeze
tonight at midnight
I also invited the girl
you talked to in the park
Let's spend this special night
together
Kimi!
Nishio!
Kimi is still not back
Damn!
Why Tsukiyama?
It's cruel
Why did it happen?
Tsukiyama needs me
I'll go there and save Kimi
I'm with you
You're barely alive
It's suicide
How can I rest
when Kimi is in trouble?
I have to go
Do you like Beethoven, Kaneki?
Tsukiyama!
I don't remember
inviting you, Nishio
Let her go
Unfortunately, I can't
It's a seasoning
for today's dish
I want Kaneki to eat it
while it's still fresh
What?
To be more precise
I want to eat Kaneki
while he eats it
That's it!
Bastard!
Traitor!
Traitor?
I didn't expect it
If you really think so
If you're the reason for Kaneki
you have to take responsibility
for what's going on
You have to feel your own taste
Nishio!
Stay there
You're still weak
like a bird
that just learned to fly
Look
This is
a real hit
And this is
a real kick
So
what's the next hit?
What about this?
A simple sudden attack
Toka!
Oh my god
It's a dangerous situation
I haven't had it for a long time
I'll make you so
that a piece won't fit in your throat
Tsukiyama!
You can talk, Kirishima
Don't scratch me
Once upon a time
you were sharp as a knife
If you were as strong as you were
I would have to
heal in a second
It's for warming up
It would be boring to put you down with one hit
Oh my god
What words
However
You're even cuter than them
As always
a great reaction
You were 14
and I was 18
Your cold eyes
pierced like crystal shards
It was unforgettable
You're pissing me off
What's going on?
I was
in love with you
You won't eat me
And I'll take Kimi with me
Good hit, Kaneki
Yeah
You know what it is
Now let's try it
Oh my god
Amazing
Godly taste
What a deep harmony
of taste in my tongue
Damn
Even better than I expected
However, now I want
even more
I don't just want to kill you, Kaneki
And now
I'll treat you to this girl
Before
your coldness was amazing
But now
everything is very bad
Something lit a fire in your eyes
It's sad, Kirishima
It's not like you
at all
Only
Don't stop me
Wait
You need me
Have you forgotten already?
I'll eat you when you eat
So
you just take people's lives
Human lives?
I'm an equal predator
If you
shake every life
then people are much worse
than us
But unlike people
we kill only them
What a
ugly scar
Kimie
Nishiki
I don't want
I don't want to eat a human
We have no choice
People eat
cows and pigs
It's a pity
Don't worry
My sister will take care of everything
Work?
Yes
We won't live forever like stray cats
But
Don't worry
Nobody will know
Okay, I'm going
Bye
I'm going
Good luck
I was fired again
Again?
What?
You grew up
Nishiki
Get out, father
Who is it?
My boss from work
Tencho
Where are they?
Find them
Sister
Don't leave me
Nishiki
Even one
Keep living
No, sister
Don't die
Don't leave me
Live
I thought it was you
Please
Nishiki
What you sow, what you reap
You and your sister
Nobody will believe
in life
Hey, you forgot your change
What?
Here
Thank you
You're welcome
What a cutie
But
She might be useful to me
Beautiful name
Means a precious future
Who invented it?
Mother or father?
Hey
What's wrong with her?
What's wrong with her?
That's strange
You bitch
Kaneki
The wound doesn't heal
Blood
We need to eat human
Nishiki
Nishiki
What happened?
Is it blood?
I'm so glad you came
Let me taste the meat
It's useless
I have no strength
Nishiki
Are you okay?
I've revealed
my true nature
And now I'm done
I'll end up like my sister
A lousy ending
Nishiki
Nishiki
You know
When we first met
My brother, who was two years old
And my mother and father
Died in an accident
I felt so bad
That I wanted to die
But you appeared
And saved me
So
Come on
Live
I'll do it
It's stupid
That I can't trust people
But if you trust me
I think I'll survive
What the hell are you doing?
You can't beat me without your Kagune
The power of Gule
Depends on the ability to use Kagune
If Kagune is an engine
If Kagune is an engine
Then human flesh is gasoline
You can barely raise your hand
Without eating
He's telling the truth
Only
It looks like
Yoriko's stroke
It only got worse
Well, let's get down to business
And you're a stubborn guy
Shut up
Don't interfere
Don't interfere with me
Don't interfere with me, damn it
Let's live together, Nishio
Nobody
I don't need anybody
Nobody
Except my Kimi
If you touch her with your finger
I'll kill you
I'll kill you
We need to do something
Human flesh, gasoline
Fuel
Toko
Which one of you is stronger
You or Tsukiyama?
Once we were equal
Listen, Toko
Give up
You can barely breathe
Tsukiyama
Let's start
Turn around
There's mine
Mine
Yours
You're a fool
There's nothing in this place
That belongs to you
Let's continue
