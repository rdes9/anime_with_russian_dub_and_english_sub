Today I am assigned to the first unit. My name is Katara Amon. Nice to meet you.
This time they sent a great man.
Investigator Rima.
The teachers praised you very much.
Nice to meet you, Amon.
And I am very pleased.
Are you going to work with Mr. Mada?
Yes.
With Mada, huh? It's hard for beginners with him.
He's a little bit of that, so don't get confused.
Mr. Mada, now you will have a partner.
Oh, I see.
My name is Mada Kurev. Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you, Amon.
Very nice to meet you.
Applehead?
Yes.
In the last year, he committed 50 violent murders.
Do you have any suspects?
Only one.
Near the crime scene, they saw a 68-year-old Muramatsu Kia.
What?
You think it's weird?
No.
No doubt about it. She is our Guly.
Do you have any proof?
Intuition.
Intuition?
Don't give him instincts, Amon.
I completely trust them.
He's got a head. Everything's fine.
Good morning, Mrs. Muramatsu.
Oh, good morning.
The weather's nice, isn't it?
You've got a lovely young man with you today.
This is my new partner, Amon.
Nice to meet you.
And this is my lovely lady, Guly.
The medical conclusion of your examination has helped me a lot.
Looking at the RC level, we'll figure out if you're Guly or not.
You've got 231.
Guly's got a little bit less.
Please accept my sincere apologies.
Why didn't you say you had the results of her examination?
You can easily fake the results.
I'm not going to lie to you.
You can easily fake the results.
They don't prove anything.
And yet...
It's part of my plan to raise suspicions.
You'd better learn while I'm alive.
You're still green after all.
Got it.
By the way, Amon, can you show me your instrument?
What?
Interesting to see.
What kind of new weapons do they give out to newcomers?
I'm sorry, Inspector 1st rank Mada,
but I have to say this.
I would ask you to be more serious about the investigation.
Good luck.
Damn it.
What is he thinking about?
And they're taking them to the office?
Mrs. Muramatsu?
Thank you for your help.
You're welcome.
I wish my grandchildren were like you.
Why are you so empty-handed?
I'm very grateful to you.
It's crazy to suspect this cute old lady.
And it's really hard.
Especially for an old lady.
You won't answer for an old lady, you bastard!
Got you.
That won't do, Amon.
You can't get in the way of these animals.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Mr. Mada.
I'm sorry.
I...
It's okay.
I took your inexperience into account.
I really appreciate your efforts.
But remember one thing.
Even if you lose your arm and leg,
you have to keep fighting.
That's what being a hunter means.
Got it.
Hey, cry, Amon.
Mr. Shinahara.
Hey, don't cry again.
What are you doing in the 20th district?
I wanted to see you.
What is this?
For Mr. Mada.
Exactly.
It's been 49 days.
Yes.
I can't believe he's dead.
Not even now.
So what do you want?
Oh, it doesn't matter.
I'll come tomorrow.
But...
It's okay. Go.
By the way, Amon.
He...
He was very proud of you.
Yes.
I was too.
Mada Kureo inspired me.
Takiski gul
Takiski
In the last night, several bodies were found in the 11th district.
Shishiji is investigating the murder as a gul attack.
Brother!
Hinami?
It's me.
What's with the outfit?
Something's wrong with my sister.
What's wrong with your sister?
Nothing.
My sister borrowed something.
I'm going outside.
Outside?
I'll buy food for Hatare.
Oh.
Hatare! Hatare!
Well, Shiyomo, look after Hinami.
I'm a cat, Hatare.
We're leaving.
After what happened, Hinami now lives with Toko.
With every day, she slowly becomes more cheerful.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
exposure
Toko.
Where's Hatare?
Master took it with him.
You can't keep this bird in the house, can you?
Toko sometimes flies in the clouds.
But...
Why you got that far? I'm gonna kill you.
I'm so sorry.
Almost everything has returned to normal, at least it seems so, but still this does not happen.
Even though everyone has calmed down with what happened, no matter how sad it is, we still have to try to survive, so we try to live as stubbornly as before.
Damn, what are you doing, stupid woman?
Ah, how do you address the Sempai, damn Nishiki?
What? My Sempai is in this damn place, and you? It seems that the end of the world is coming soon.
Having an assistant for a stupid student with a dirty mouth like you pisses me off. Maybe you'll shut up, huh?
You do not tell me here, stupid woman.
We have a cultural institution, maybe you will stop swearing, huh?
Stupid woman!
Damn Nishiki!
What's wrong with you? You can only shout, stupid woman.
I'm starting to get angry.
I'm not some kind of...
Have you heard the legend of the devil's monkey?
Stupid woman!
Damn Nishiki!
Well, again, stupid creature. How did you even get into school?
It's none of your business, damn Nishiki!
I'm sorry, Mr. Mada. If I was in a hurry, I would have killed the rabbit myself. I swear.
Do you want to say that you were controlled by Marisa herself?
Well, how can I say? I don't really remember what happened then.
It looks like I attacked Mr. Yoma.
Cool! You tried! Renchik even got angry at me.
And you are a village girl, Kanekichi.
Mrs. Aitori!
I'm kidding, I'm kidding. Kanekichi, only you and Renchik do not understand jokes.
I'm sorry.
This has already happened once.
It feels like Risa was controlling me then.
In short, you want me to tell you about Risa?
Yes.
Okay, Kanekichi, your sister will give you a hint.
Risa, right?
Honestly, Kanekichi.
Yes.
I'm not sure myself that I know a lot about Risa.
You see, she appeared out of nowhere.
Out of nowhere?
No one knows where she came from and what she used to do.
Even so, it's unlikely that Risa just fell from a tree. If you look for it, you can dig something.
I think so.
What about the 11th district?
The 11th?
Risa moved from the 11th to the 20th district. Are you sure?
The 11th district.
I have to go there somehow.
I have to go there.
I'm sorry.
No, I have to apologize.
I thought for a second.
Okay, bye.
It smells delicious for some reason.
Insurance, reading ticket, and here we have a student.
Kanekiken.
19 years old.
So we are the same age.
And the most important thing is ...
It's very sad.
A pocketbook?
Yes.
And you don't remember his face?
I didn't have time to look.
Did you go to the police?
Yes, there was a trifle.
Damn, you're pathetic.
If you were more careful, you wouldn't have to let the snot out now.
And now he's right.
The chairman of the Sijitsu-Nayoshi-Washu decided to increase the number of hunters in the 11th and 20th districts.
Thus, the 20th district is really so dangerous.
Who knows?
I would not want to die.
It seems that there is some kind of community of hooligans in the 20th district.
Why did you take it?
Unlike other districts, there are often murders here.
I think this is because the local hooligans united.
I see.
But Jora and Gorman disappeared without a trace, starting to hunt very often.
This means that this hooligan group may have eliminated those who were on the black list of the CCG.
Hey, Kaneki, you're kind of pale.
Oh, sorry, everything's fine.
I see you know a lot about hooligans.
I'm quite interested in hooligans.
Yeah, you'll see.
This book is just super!
What?
He writes about the hooligan gang in the 3rd district, wearing clown masks.
And about how Matsubara appeared in Tokyo, a hooligan from Wakayama.
He also talks about hooligans' hair.
See you, Kaneki.
Mr. Amon, people from the main office have arrived.
Okay, I'll be right there.
I wonder who they sent.
I hope it's the special forces.
Oh!
Hi!
Mr. Shinahara, was it you who was sent here?
No, I'm on a different case.
Two of them were sent here.
Mr. Hojji?
Long time no see, Katara.
Glad to see you.
Mr. Amon!
Nice to meet you!
The main office, 1st department, 2nd rank investigator, Takezawa Sedo.
He's your fan.
He's very worried.
Hojji's assistant.
That's...
Nice to meet you, investigator Takezawa.
Nice to meet you!
Amon, they've come to assess the 20th district.
Huh?
You'll be in the special forces group.
The special forces group?
Yes.
Marude's order.
We'll go to the 11th district.
The 11th?
Really?
Is everything so bad in the 11th district?
Yes.
According to Yomo, the ghouls have united to track the hunters together.
Looks like it's going to be a massacre.
Is that so?
There could be a lot of trouble at this pace.
What kind of trouble?
A war, for example.
Or maybe the day will come when I'll be called a devil's monkey again.
By the way, where's Toko?
Probably with Hitara.
I thought she didn't like birds.
You're right.
I'll go look for her.
Hitara!
He had a family too.
Toko?
I wonder where she is now.
Everyone has a family, right?
Ayato!
What's up, sis?
Poor thing, you're hurt.
Dad!
Let's take him home.
Yeah!
I found a worm!
Are you a man or what?
But...
What are you doing for Chunta?
Yeah.
Did you collect so much?
Yeah!
Toko, you're as energetic as your mom.
What about me?
I don't like worms either.
You're all dad, Ayato.
It's time for you to go to bed.
Dad, I want a hug!
Me too!
Okay.
You've grown up.
Toko, you're older, so you have to teach Ayato.
Okay.
Ayato, you're a man and you have to protect your sister.
Okay.
Promise me.
Where's your family?
Well...
My father died when I was born.
And my mother died when I was in primary school.
I see.
Katara, it's time to eat!
Oh, brother!
Hinami, you woke up!
Yeah.
Do I look good?
Very good.
Did you go to the salon?
No.
My sister cut my hair.
What?
Nothing.
Do you think it's weird?
No.
I was just surprised at your skill.
Really?
Katara, you're a poor worm!
You're a son of a bitch!
Watch your tongue, you stupid parrot!
I'll fry you in the pan!
Katara!
Bitter.
Have you met her?
Risa?
I don't have the best memories about her.
This time she won't run away.
District 20.
I'm here for the first time.
I feel like time is running slower here.
You fools!
Don't relax!
Get to work!
Are you sure he's here, Mr. Banjo?
There's an antique cafe here,
owned by one old gul.
Let's go.
Risa would go there.
It's like Tuzigrelko.
Banjo ordered something?
No.
Damn clown.
At this pace,
Yamori and Toffeea will get to him.
All right,
let's go to District 20.
We have to save Risa.
Yeah!
By the way, Mr. Banjo,
are you here for the first time?
No.
I'm here for the first time.
Yeah!
By the way, Mr. Ayato,
are you from District 20, too?
I don't remember much about it.
It's mostly just a bunch of weaklings.
If I recall correctly,
I have a relative there.
One of those weaklings.
Let's continue.

Let's hear it.
Thank you for watching!
Thank you for watching!
See you next time!
So that's what you hear in the neighborhood.
Kimi.
What's wrong with you?
Stupid glasses.
People, do you want to see how I beat him up?
Mr. Uta is angry!
He's trying to take over District 4!
I'll get it again, right?
