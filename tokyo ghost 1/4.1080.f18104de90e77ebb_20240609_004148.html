        <pre>Tsukiyama?
Long time no see, Kirishima.
What brings you here?
As always, you're cold.
Well, I like you for that.
You're pissing me off, you idiot.
Hey, you, with the bandage.
New?
What's your name?
Kaneki.
Nice scent.
Hey, you're pissing me off and getting in the way of our work, so get out of here.
Yeah, I see you can be rude.
I'll go get a cup of coffee later.
When Mr. Yoshimura is here.
Okay.
Nice.
See you, Kaneki.
See you.
Who is he?
Be careful with him.
The main pain of the 20th district.
Oh, thanks.
Kaneki means...
What a tempting...
His smell.
TEACHER
Taki Guri
I'm holding my breath
Please
I can't break it, I can't break it
I'm going crazy, I can't go crazy
I found you
In this shaken, distorted world
I can't see anything
Don't look at me
In this shaken, distorted world
I don't want to kiss you
Remember my words
In this shaken, distorted world
I don't want to kiss you
Remember my words
Remember my words
In this shaken, distorted world
I don't want to kiss you
Remember my words
In this shaken, distorted world
I don't want to kiss you
Remember my words
In this shaken, distorted world
I don't want to kiss you
Remember my words
You're just talking back
It's true
Piss off, piss off, piss off, piss off, piss off
Piss off, piss off
Piss off, piss off, piss off, piss off
Thank you for the treat
I ate it
Yoriko
Kaneki
Hi
Hello
This is Tsukiyama-shu
Can I sit down?
Of course
Thank you
This is Mr. Tsukiyama
What are you doing here?
If I say
That I wanted to meet you
Well
I don't even know
What a fool
One of the victims of the 20th district
It seems that you like to read a lot
I learned about this in Anteiko
What are you?
I'm not like that
The books are great, aren't they?
By reading just one proposal
You can immediately get dirty in your dreams
I think the reader
See and feel much more
Than the author puts into his work
And plus
Everyone has their own vision of the plot
If you fully imagine the world
Described by the author
You will be interested in reading
You are
You are a person
You are a person
Do you like to read?
I just got into the world of books
I forget about the hard times
He is the same as me
I am surprised
Do you also like Takatsuki?
Yes
He writes simply, but with a deep context
I am charmed
I am charmed by the hidden meaning of his works
I also like his style
I see
Takatsuki, right?
By the way, Kaneki
There is one cafe
The owner of which is crazy
Let's go there somehow
They say there is even a Takatsuki Sen
What?
Mr. Takatsuki?
Although on the other hand
It seems that Kirishima
Talked about me
No, just
It's okay, I'm always easy to understand
Wrong
After all, I did not communicate with anyone
After the death of Kamishiro
Kamishiro?
Kamishiro Risa?
I think you are like her
There are not so many book lovers among Guli
I always wanted
Have a friend with whom
It was possible to calmly discuss
What I like
Listen
If I can help
See you on Sunday at 15.00
It does not seem that he is bad
Kaneki, can you go home?
Okay
All the best
By the way, Kaneki
Yoma asked you to go down to the basement
Mr. Yoma?
The basement?
Where are we?
As always, it is not talkative
There are pigeons in our area
So
If it gets to the worst
You have to be able to protect yourself
Let's start
Wait
I see you are much more inclined
But you are not capable of anything else
Yes
After work, come here
We will train
Okay
Will you come with me?
Someone wants to meet you
Who are you, Kaneki?
Finally we met
Renchiksuo told you a lot
I'm the owner of the bar Eiteri
Nice to meet you
Nice to meet you
Come on, do not worry
Relax, Kaneki
Well
Have you known each other for a long time?
Yeah, right
Do not spill water
After all, Ren and Suta did not get along before
Because of these two
The fourth district was much more dangerous
But now we are getting along
I think
Once Ren was completely crazy
Really?
Yeah
Just as soon as he gets angry
Yes, exactly
He was so scary
Enough about me
Eiteri, you seemed to want to talk to him
Yes
Here, take it
Thank you
And this is not wine
And what are you?
Wow
I see this for the first time
Only one eye is red
Sorry, sorry
Such a rarity here
Here, as an apology
I wonder if there are any more
Who knows
I do not know
Who knows
Is it really
There are still the same hooligans as me
Are you interested?
Yes
Okay, Kaneki
What do you think
Who will get if you cross
Man and hooligan
Man and hooligan, you say?
Dead
Death from hunger
The chances of successful birth are very low
However, very rarely
This is born
Half-human, half-hooligan
Half-human, half-hooligan
Hooligan, hooligan is much stronger
Pure-blooded
And red in him
Only one eye
Although this is in fact
A very simple question
I'm sure
What is the answer
Although this is just a city legend
One-eyed hooligan
This
Yes, yes
Ask what you want
Rize
Do you know anything about Kamashira Rize?
So, so
And what
The fact is that my body became like this
After meeting her
Wow
By the way, I don't know anything about her
I see
Rize means
She was a mysterious dead hooligan
The last few months
Everyone only talks about it
Mysterious death
It was an accident
Do you really think
That it was an accident
Kaneki Ken
Itori
They say that day on the roof
They saw someone's silhouette
This raises suspicions
What
It turns out that everything was set up
Rize was killed
Itori
I say
All this is just rumors, rumors
Who
Who could do this
Kaneki
Kaneki
Yes
Something wrong
No, nothing
This is Mr. Tsukiyama
Yes
What did you usually talk about with Rize
With Kamashira
Well, we talked about books
And of course
About food
Thank you for the invitation
Tsukiyama
But I don't want to join
Your gourmet club
Why
Don't you want to try something special
You understand
Your dish will definitely be
Not enough for me
I do not argue that it is not comparable
With the aroma of food
But the coals that pretend to be people
Have their own tastes, right
It's funny
What people are like
Yes Tsukiyama
Damn woman
How such a pitiful pig
I will not laugh at my food
Mr. Tsukiyama
Ouch
Oh, it's my fault
Sorry
It's okay
I was just careless
By the way, Kaneki
I know this is not an apology
But there is a favorite place of Kamashira not far away
Maybe we go there
Favorite place of Rize
Of course
Great
In this case, let's go there right now
Does your finger hurt?
No, it seems that the blood stopped
I'll wash it later and
Oh, come on
Don't worry about it
I'll wash it myself
Brought
I can not believe that
I put everything out
Dostey
Behave as usual
Tsukiyama Shuu
Endure a little more
What a sweet aroma
And harmonious
This is an indescribable pleasure
I'm so happy
As if I flew to the stars
Mr. Tsukiyama
Mr. Tsukiyama
You were right
By the way
Why should I take a shower?
Mr. Kaneki
Yes
I'll leave the clothes here
Feel at home
Thank you
So Rize often happened here?
I brought you coffee
Enjoy
Excuse me, where is Mr. Tsukiyama?
Oh
What's going on?
I'm sorry for the delay, gentlemen
This is today's main dish
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Yes
Today we have a delicacy
A real gul
Gul
I do not prefer cannibalism
Set Mr. M-M
Watch, m-m
Yes this is m-m
Ladies and gentlemen, do not worry
The gul meat has a vulgar taste
I'm sure all the people present were attracted by the previously unknown seductive aroma.
Mr. Tsukiyama!
Why?
My attention attracted his smell.
His body is ghoulish, but at the same time it has a human smell.
Oh, it's true!
What an aroma!
Excellent!
I want to try it!
So, now you're interested in the taste of the ghoulish that smells like a human.
I've been seduced!
It was a trap!
A completely new taste and smell!
A real unknown taste!
And now let's start today's show!
And here is today's fighter who will serve the dish!
Tell me, madame.
Yes, what's the matter, Mr. Pidgey?
What fighter did you bring today?
Today is my favorite.
Taro!
Taro!
Nice to meet you!
Knock, knock, knock, knock!
Crush him!
What?
Wait!
Wait!
Taro, catch him!
Mommy!
His owner, madame, can cheer up!
We need to go!
We need to go!
We need to do something!
Don't run away!
Kill him!
Bad news! Don't run away!
Cut, cut!
Useless!
Like a pea on the wall!
What's the matter, Kaneki?
Why don't you use Kagune?
We have little time.
We need to figure out how to get out of here!
Give it to me!
What?
Did he break his legs?
Ladies and gentlemen, it looks like the drug has begun to work!
Is it coffee?
That's it!
Ca-caught you!
Get him out!
Turn his neck!
Crush him!
Very funny!
Goodbye, Kaneki!
What? What is it?
He...
One-eyed Gull!
One-eyed?
One-eyed, right?
Take care of him, Taro!
Come on!
It hurts! It really hurts!
One-eyed...
Rarity...
Mr. M.M., are you okay?
What a treat!
Get up!
Taro!
Mommy!
Useless!
That's it!
Hurry up!
Hurry up!
Mommy is delighted!
It hurts!
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm sorry to disappoint you.
I didn't know that he was the so-called One-eyed Gull.
However, I do not intend to spoil the dinner
on which we all gathered here.
How do you like it?
It hurts!
How about eating Madam A's father?
Taro! Taro!
It hurts!
Taro!
You...
Dream!
Don't disgrace me, okay?
I'll be eaten up!
Did you like the show, Kaneki?
I hope the joke was good.
It seems that you need to be tougher.
We'll remember it.
What a rare pleasure!
I won't let anyone eat it.
Let's move on!

We'll hear more.
To be continued...
Yeah, that's right, Tsukiyama!
That's the face!
Hold it like that!
More, more emotions!
That's it!
Fantastic!
Great, Tsukiyama!
No words!
This...
What are you doing?
Oh, well, you see, I'll be on the covers of new comics.
Do you want to join Kaneki?
Well?
What?
No, thank you!
