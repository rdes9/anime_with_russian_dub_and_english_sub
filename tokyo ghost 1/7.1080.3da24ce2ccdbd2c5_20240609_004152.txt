Hey, look under your feet!
Hinami!
Brother!
I'm sorry!
What happened to Hinami?
Mom!
She...
Where is she?
Run!
Run!
Run!
Run!
Run!
Run!
I see you're not used to fighting.
You don't use your kaguna to the fullest.
You sacrifice your life for the sake of a child.
You've got goosebumps.
It's funny to watch you, Guli, trying to behave like people.
And I won't get it myself.
You can relax, Amon.
The rest is up to me.
What do I do?
What do I do?
Why?
No, it can't be!
It can!
Darling...
Cool!
Perfect look!
Great facial expression!
No more despair, no more hate!
Mom!
Don't shout!
What do I do?
How can I help?
It's a pity.
I can finally hear your last words.
What's going on?
Don't hold back.
Bye!
It's a pity.
The time has come.
I just had to make sure that the girl wouldn't see this horror.

How are you, Toka?
I'm sorry, I've been away for a long time.
No problem.
Did something happen?
Ryoko was killed by Naguri's hunters.
Mrs. Ryoko...
What's wrong with Hinami? Is she alive?
She's sleeping in the next room.
What about her face? Did they see him?
How can it be? Is it getting worse?
When the time comes, I want to transfer Hinami to the 24th district.
Are you kidding me?
She can't survive in that hole alone!
Toka!
Can't we just kill them?
All together!
Yomo is with us!
All together!
No.
If they kill the pigeons in the 20th district,
they'll send even more to finally track us down and kill us.
But...
Toka!
Yomo is absolutely right.
We can't attack them.
This is the best option for the common good.
Even after what happened,
one of us was killed.
And you're going to sit there silently?
Hinami's mother is dead.
We have to take revenge for her!
We can't attack them because we have to take revenge.
The real reason is that
one of us wishes for revenge without risking her own life.
Are you hinting at me?
If only...
If only Toka was there instead of me...
You shouldn't blame yourself, Kaneki.
Kaneki...
I...
I...
I couldn't do anything.
Looks like Jason's log isn't in the 20th district.
According to the report,
the 11th district is most suitable.
Do you think Jason is also getting ready to attack?
I think so.
It's a pity, but outside of his district,
we're a weak force.
Let's leave Jason to a special class investigator, Marude.
Abjura and Gurman are the only hooligans from the class in the 20th district.
These two don't really show up.
As if they're trying to trick us.
Based on what I've learned,
chasing them could be a waste of time.
Which means...
We'll smear them one after the other.
No doubt about it.
There's going to be a big fish soon.
I'm sure of it.
Well, we'll be back tomorrow for the investigation.
That's all for today.
You may be free.
Got it.
Okay.
Where are you going?
I'm good at work.
Yeah, I almost forgot.
Because of the recent incident,
number 745 knows our faces.
So be careful.
He's joking.
She's a kid.
A bunch of freaks.
Welcome.
I'm Temporus Kurina Manigiri.
Mr. Nakajima again?
Back off.
He always orders them.
I see.
And you?
Your order, one kakiage.
Mr. Amon, you're an academy graduate, aren't you?
Well, yeah.
What were you studying?
Information and laws of the gulag.
I was also studying self-defense.
It's against the rules, so no details.
Did you have any girls?
Hey, Kusaba!
I had two.
They were very smart and strong-willed.
Really?
Didn't you fall in love with them?
Baka!
Stop it, you fool!
They were killed in battle.
Killed?
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
It happens all the time.
You get used to someone and you lose him right away.
I guess I'll go.
Take care of yourself.
And all the best to you.
All the best.
Fool.
I'm sorry.
The more you get used to someone, the faster you lose him.
I think we need to try.
Don't be stupid.
We still have a lot of work to do.
No less than in other districts.
What can you say?
The guys from the headquarters would sort it out in a moment.
As much as you want, Noy.
But we will always be ordinary employees.
It seems that Mr. Amon does not want an increase.
It seems that only justice is important for him.
Yeah.
You noticed too.
To be honest, he's amazing.
It's useless to compare yourself with someone from the Kusaba headquarters.
Yeah.
To be honest, I don't mind doing paper work.
It's a much safer street.
But when I look at it, I get hot.
Maybe I should try?
Kusaba?
Kusaba!
Oh, you!
Be careful, Mr. Nakajima!
Who is it?
Oh, Kako!
Super fast gul!
So, am I here?
No.
Let your hands and legs be lost when the enemy is in front of you.
That's right, Amon.
That's what it means to be a hunter.
But you forgot your tool.
Mr. Mada, you can't lose your self-control, Amon.
I understand.
Take a little rest.
Oh.
You're back.
Well done, well done.
What?
Aren't you the friend of that woman gul that I killed yesterday?
You want me to tell you how that pig died?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I completely forgot.
But it was only yesterday.
How weak and unhappy she was.
Oh, you!
Great chance, Amon.
Let's see what you learned in the academy.
Gulu, like the guy, makes a stubborn combination of attacks that completely depend on speed.
However, unlike others, they quickly get tired.
Hey, that woman gul had a daughter, didn't she?
Maybe you can tell me where she is?
I really feel sorry for her.
After all, she's terribly upset that her mom died.
We should kill her too.
Bastard!
Stupid.
How much, in your opinion, of such garbage have I already removed?
And you are no more than another garbage.
Well, okay.
Rabbit.
Gulu like the guy.
Hinami.
Toga!
Don't come any closer!
But you're wounded!
Don't worry about me.
Did you bump into the pigeons?
Toga is wounded.
We need to help her.
No.
What are you talking about?
If she attacked the pigeons, it means she is ready to take all responsibility.
Everyone doesn't care if she survives or dies.
Are you kidding me?
Toga!
Toga!
Stop!
Listen.
Toga is wounded.
Toga!
Stop!
Listen.
I understand that you have seen a lot and made a decision based on this.
But I don't know what to do when it comes to attacking the pigeons.
And how, in this case, should Guli act?
So I'll decide myself how to act right.
What?
You need to treat the wound.
I'll do it.
But you're wounded.
What do you have to do with it?
But...
You've already got me, damn man!
I'm half Guli.
Why did you go alone?
It's okay if the killer dies like me.
But when Guli, like Mrs. Ryoko or Hinami, kills without any regret,
I'm very angry.
She understands that she's wrong.
She understands it and still fights.
Toga, I can't kill.
I don't think the presence of the hunters is as bad as I don't think you're right.
But when Mrs. Ryoko died, I had a strong feeling.
Die, man, Guli, or whoever I knew.
I wouldn't do it.
If you died, it would hurt me.
Come on.
Let me help you.
I can't kill the hunters.
But I'm not going to sit down and fold my hands either.
I don't want to.
In order to show our respect to the brave investigator, Kusaba Ippeyo,
killed by Guli when doing his official duties,
let's honor him with a moment of silence.
Mada didn't come?
One of his people died, and he didn't even honor his memory.
Listen, Amon, when you die, it will be the same.
If not for one thing,
now this fool would be an assistant to a special investigator.
What a disaster.
The case is soon scheduled in the 11th district.
You will also be attracted.
So hurry up and dig up the shit in the 20th district.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Mr. Nakajima?
Mr. Amon.
It's good that he lived alone.
It would be bad if he got married.
It seems he respected you.
Me?
Your order.
The guy in the glasses.
The guy in the glasses.
The guy in the glasses.
The guy in the glasses.
The guy in the glasses.
Order!
The guy in the glasses is not with you today?
Master, bring me some water.
Got it, a glass of water.
Two would be better.
I always order the same thing.
Every time I ordered it,
I heard Mr. Nakajima again.
What a fool.
He always allowed me to pay for him.
And I always said, shut up and eat for the sake of food.
Who am I supposed to buy food for now, moron?
Kusabu was killed for a reason.
Mr. Nakajima, this time pay for me.
I'll eat more than Kusabu.
Well, then I'll pay.
Toka!
Huh?
What are you doing?
Didn't you say you wanted to help?
Yeah, but...
It'll be fine.
Okay, let's move on.
Huh?
Now it's your turn.
What do you mean?
Wait, Toka!
Mada is listening.
Senior investigator Mada,
we have obvious information about room 745.
He says he's not sure, so maybe it's a prank.
But I thought you should know.
So what?
Well, thank you.
You're welcome.
The man was led by a sense of justice.
The children of the lost relatives.
And those who fight to protect others.
Why should they die?
You don't use tools here, do you?
A unique smell of hula hoop.
Obviously, the rabbit somehow has something to do with room 745.
And now it's...
What's common here?
Welcome.
It's all set.
I guess we'll have some fun, rabbit.
Oh, yeah.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go, rabbit.
Hinami.
I'll change him.
I'll change our wrong world.

Oh, Kaneki, Kaneki!
Oh, Mr. Uta!
What?
Your mask is ready.
I decided to personally deliver it.
Try it on while I'm here.
Don't put it on like this.
Yes, yes.
Like this?
Great!
Very beautiful!
At first I thought I'd do it with one eye,
just like you.
But then I realized that
it was definitely better.
Thank God!
It was worth it!
Mr. Uta!
