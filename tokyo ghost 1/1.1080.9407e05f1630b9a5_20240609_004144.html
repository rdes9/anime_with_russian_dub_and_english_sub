        <pre>To the base of the coast guard 203, the violators of the
noticed skyscraper of the attack.
This is Guli, I repeat, Guli, immediately there.
Ah, more, more, delicious.
I see they did not joke, calling you insatiable.
I hate when I'm disturbed to eat.
You know who I am.
I know, a dull man who likes to distract others.
An order from above, I came for your soul.
But first, I'll break your finger or two,
hand or both, or both legs.
You don't mind, do you?
A little toy for such a gromila.
Better ride a horse, how cute.
I'll make her out of you.
Give it back.
They are mine.
Give it back.
I will not play with you.
Tokyo Guli
This morning, the skyscraper of one of the trade enterprises Tokyo Takada
We found several of the native bodies.
In the bodies was found something similar to the saliva of Guli.
Therefore, the incident is investigated as their attack.
I said something funny.
I say already, the first date in the book does not suit.
And what?
I think she will be happy.
I'll tell you right away, consider that you have already been sewn.
What?
Then we will be alone with her and eat hamburgers.
It would be better to help with advice.
No, everything is super.
Just in your spirit.
But you are definitely wrong.
Everything I do is wrong.
I would do it myself.
Listen, you need to choose a place where you would like the girl.
For example.
What?
For example?
Yes, you yourself do not know.
If I knew, I would not be sitting here on a date with you.
Here you are right.
In the last few days, brutal attacks of Guli took place in the 20th district.
Pretty close.
Further in the news.
Well, well, well.
Who is she?
Your cutie.
She?
Well, no.
Although she is nothing.
Excuse me.
Cappuccino, please.
And you, Kaneki?
I'm you.
By the way, what's your name?
Hide.
Kirishima Toka.
Ms. Toka.
Do you have a boyfriend?
Sit down, idiot.
Pretty girl.
What to do if they kick me out?
It is in this cafe that we are always with her.
Here.
This is her.
Give up.
What?
You are clearly not a beauty or something.
Monster.
So, I saw your love sufferings, so I guess I'll go.
Wait, Hide.
See you, Toka.
Good luck to you, confused Kaneki.
It seems that sometimes you are lucky too.
Yeah, we even read the same novelist.
Yeah, and what is it?
Takazaki-sen?
Takatsuki-sen.
Takatsuki-sen.
Takatsuki-sen.
Takatsuki-sen.
Takatsuki-sen.
Takatsuki-sen.
Takatsuki-sen.
Takatsuki-sen.
Takatsuki-sen.
Takatsuki-sen.
We are going to the library this Sunday.
I see.
I don't understand what kind of date is in the library, but good luck.
Yeah.
I admit, it looks disgusting.
Yeah.
They say they can walk around without food for months, but this meal is not like that.
We will go to the zoo, or they will eat all the people soon.
They are animals.
Unlike them, Scott brings benefits.
I agree.
Kaneki, what is your favorite book by Takatsuki?
I think the first one.
It became a real hit.
Thin and exciting, so to speak.
That's right.
So talented to write in a young age.
Are you okay?
I'm okay.
I...
Well...
Are you not hungry, Risa?
Huh?
Well, to be honest, I'm on a diet.
I'm sorry, I'm going to the toilet.
Girl...
Thank you for today.
Thank you.
It was very fun.
To be honest, I live next to the place where those creatures were.
Guli?
I'm terribly worried.
One thought about it makes me shiver.
Don't worry.
I'll see you out.
And then Hideo asked,
what is more important to you, me or Novella?
He's a funny guy.
Yes.
Why did you start reading books?
My father left a lot of books after he died.
Oh.
I don't remember how I lost it.
I liked his books.
And I read them all the time when Mom wasn't home.
Even after her death.
By the way, I was only talking about this to Hideo.
Really?
This way.
Oh, yes.
What happened, Toka?
Nothing.
Well, we're almost there.
Risa, if you don't mind, let's meet again.
We are the same age and we love the same books.
We are very similar.
Kaneki.
Yes?
To be honest, I noticed you.
The way you looked at me.
What?
You mean you too?
Yes.
You...
You...
You...
You...
You...
You...
You...
I like you too.
I like you too.
Delicious!
Kaneki.
There's something I love more than reading.
You know what?
I'll scare those who don't try to run away from me.
This face is lovely.
Will you let me enjoy it even more?
That must be it.
That must be it.
Got you.
Kaneki...
Kaneki!
And now I'm going to gently pull out your insides, okay?
What? You haven't died yet?
Too bad. Do I really like you?
You're so plump, so tender, so appetizing.
You're so beautiful.
You're so beautiful.
You're so beautiful.
You're so beautiful.
You're so beautiful.
How could this be?
The organs are damaged.
What's that?
Where am I?
I think I was on a date with Riza.
We need to transfer the organs.
Without the consent of the relatives.
The organs?
The relatives?
What are they about?
Dr. Kano!
I take responsibility for myself.
Transfer her organs to him.
The warmth...
is...
It's strange. What's happening to me?
Mr. Kaneki!
Aren't you hungry?
Oh, yes. Your friend came again today.
Oh, Dr. Kano.
How are you feeling, Kaneki?
I heard you haven't eaten anything since you woke up.
But it looks like everything is fine.
It's a strange taste.
Taste?
Everything has a terrible taste.
There's nothing strange here.
You barely survived.
Don't rush.
Just have a rest.
I'll come later.
Nothing strange?
I feel like I've been with Riza all the time.
I just had a dream.
But I'm sure of one thing.
I've been with Riza since then.
Something's wrong.
Kaneki!
Congratulations on your graduation!
I've cooked delicious food for you, including your favorite hamburger.
I hope you'll like it.
Post scriptum.
Come to school when you feel like it.
It's boring to be alone.
Hide.
Thank you.
I'm sorry.
First of all, ghouls don't need to eat too often.
The dead body allows them to live a month or two.
Mr. Agura, can ghouls eat the same as normal people?
No, they can only eat people.
And their language is not like ours.
Normal human food for them tastes terrible.
Their language is not like ours.
Tastes terrible.
Kaneki!
Sonia!
I've cooked delicious food for you, including your favorite hamburger.
Hide.
Did you buy all this for me?
It can't be.
Kaneki!
I was told you were going out tonight.
How was it, my friend?
With cards?
What do you know?
Theres a phone call.
Hang up.
I'm letting him out today, but he is not getting his phone call.
I believe I messed up today.
How are you feeling?
I decided to tell you that in the library at the Akatski station, or whatever it's called,
they give out autographs.
In any case, call me back.
People.
People.
People.
People.
Child.
People.
Blood.
Girl.
Man.
Child.
Boy.
Girl.
Child.
Boy.
Blood.
Blood.
Blood.
Hey, he...
He gave up on you, stupid.
What is it?
I know what the reason is.
Give him his organs.
Don't hurt him with swords and knives.
Then...
Then...
Then...
I...
What?
Am I dead now?
What am I supposed to do now?
Kill him.
And eat him.
What am I?
I feel like...
This smell.
I feel it for the first time.
But it's so familiar.
Sweet aroma.
Like a mother's baking.
There's something I can eat there.
Where is it?
Where is it?
Where?
Where?
Damn it.
Close.
Girl.
Man.
How could I smell the body?
You're Guld, aren't you?
What is it?
Are you okay?
My name is Kazuo.
I haven't eaten for a long time,
so I won't share it with many people.
But here, eat.
Damn, don't go into someone else's garden.
I haven't met you.
By the way, why do you have only one red eye?
Disgusting.
Do you know what's shining on someone else's territory?
No.
I didn't know.
I got here by accident.
Okay, imagine.
Your girlfriend lies naked,
and suddenly someone with her pants down
says,
I didn't do anything,
I just happened to be here.
So we have the same situation.
Personally, I would kill the scoundrel,
so I'll kill you
as a simple violator.
Whose territory are you talking about?
Since when is it yours?
Nishiki.
Tuka.
As far as I know,
that insatiable woman is dead.
And now this is your territory?
After Risa, the right to distribute the pasture
between the weaker guls
as well as the management of the 20th district
goes to Anteiku.
What?
A bunch of quiet people like Anteiku
have no right to decide every little thing.
Even before Risa,
there was my pasture here.
Because you're weak.
I'm a little angry when a little girl younger than me
tries to build a cool thing out of herself.
What are you doing?
I got it!
You hit harder.
Really?
Next time, hit harder
and don't forget your body.
Do you want it?
You don't want it?
By the way,
only one eye has changed.
What happened to Risa?
Why aren't you eating?
And your eye?
Please help me.
I know you won't believe it,
but I'm a human.
And still,
I want to eat.
I want to eat it with all my might.
But then,
I don't want to be a human anymore.
If you're so cool,
eat.
Not at all!
No, no, no!
I can't eat something like this.
What is it?
What is it like to be a ghoul?
To kill people,
to kill each other.
I'm not like that.
I'm a human.
You're a fool.
Why don't you just give up?
If you're afraid of her yourself,
I'll help you.
