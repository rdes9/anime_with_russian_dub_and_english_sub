...
Yes, this is the headquarters.
Yeah, this is Marudet, report the situation.
We were attacked by a group of ghouls that were in the tree of Aogirri.
What's the matter?
It was the last one.
You bastard! Who are you?
Finished?
Yeah.
Shall we go?
Yes, Mr. Tatara.

Than is strict!
What do we know?
They Bhangagul, who call themselves tree of aogirri
We do not know exactly how many, but most importantly,
They have one-eyed kings.
So, one-eyed.
Yoma, let's go back to Anteika.
It's not crowded here today.
Because there are more pigeons.
Now everyone is afraid to leave the house.
Oh, welcome.
It's...
You have a manager?
Well...
I asked you, where is the manager?
He left for a while.
Well, where exactly?
Hey!
What?
What kind of manners is this?
If you have questions, at least order coffee.
What?
Hey!
If you need something from the boss, I'll give it to him.
I have a question for you too.
Do you know Kamishiro Rizzo?
My name is Banjo Kazoochi.
I'm from the 11th district.
I knew Rizzo before.
And?
Why would she be here?
When she left the 11th district, she was interested in one cafe.
It's...
Why is Rizzo carrying you?
Hey!
No fights!
Mr. Banjo!
Are you him?
What?
Are you Rizzo's boyfriend?
No, we're with her.
You're with her?
No!
It's a mistake!
Misunderstanding!
Mr. Banjo, wake up!
I'm sorry.
He fell asleep.
25 again.
I'm sorry, our leader.
It's okay.
Shinohara and Amon have arrived.
hey…
Senior investigator Chino,
and senior investigator Tainaka
Let alone the old specialist friend Arima,
senior investigator Hirako
You attracted JR查 nữa, right?
Take a seat if you would!
We hear you.
Did you hear that?
The 11th district was attacked.
Despite the fact that the attackers had a good time there,
according to the police report, the number of dead people from the crime scene is zero.
Oh, he's awake.
Are you okay?
I'm sorry about the other day.
What's your name?
Kaneki.
Kaneki, huh?
You look much stronger than you look.
What are you talking about?
So that's why Rizzo chose you.
No, it's not like that, Mr. Banjo.
Rizzo and I are not in such a relationship.
So I was wrong?
Yes.
I'm sorry! I admit it's my fault!
What are you talking about?
No.
If I don't do it, I won't forgive myself.
And still...
Where is Rizzo now?
Mrs. Rizzo...
She...
More...
Here...
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
She's not here anymore.
I see.
I had no doubt.
She was always capricious.
I'm sorry I couldn't help you.
Listen, Kaneki.
I have a request for you.
A request, you say?
Yes.
If you see her again, tell her something.
Let her run.
A few months ago, a gang of ghouls called the Maogiri tree
cut their way through the 11th district.
Now they're aiming at the pigeons
to finally drive the ghouls out of the 11th district like us.
They're very strong.
Now the pigeons in the 11th district are literally hunting.
At the moment, I'm one of the fugitives.
But Rizzo is looking for them.
Why, I don't know.
I'm sure she's in danger.
Mrs. Rizzo?
I advise you to leave the district as soon as possible.
You're not to blame for anything,
but you'd better run.
Otherwise...
Mr. Banjo!
What are you doing here, Banjo?
Or are you going to lose your pulse again?
What about me?
Hey!
Tuka!
What about me?
So he is Token.
Yo!
Long time no see, silly sister.
Where have you been, fool?
I've been studying society.
Unlike you, flying in the clouds.
Oh, you're a self-loved child.
You're a child yourself.
Look around, fool.
What took you so long?
Can we come in?
Where are they from?
Excuse me.
So, what would you like to do?
And where am I?
Oh, I see a police car.
What?
That's lucky.
The name of the gang is Drevo Aogiri.
They have more than 200 members.
Before, so many hooligans were never going to get together.
They want nothing.
Who knows what these hooligans are thinking about.
Nevertheless, we lost the 11th district.
And this is true.
As soon as this is over, it is likely that most hooligans alone will want to join Drevo Aogiri.
There will be a war between people and hooligans.
Therefore, you must trust me with your life.
This is an order, damn it.
Rejection is unacceptable.
From now on, the special group of the 11th district ...
Excuse me.
I am a subordinate of Mr. Shinahara, Suzuya Juzo.
I'm sorry I'm late.
I got a little lost.
Damn it.
You better take care of me.
Hi, Toyota.
Oh, come on.
I see your older sister here.
Apparently, you are both dangerous.
I'm just jealous.
I'm impressed that you found me, Yamori.
I followed Banjo.
And with you I see the same greenery.
Risa is not here.
It stinks here.
It's because I can't stand it.
Hey, Niko.
Will this one go away?
Why not?
Let's take it and go.
Okay.
Take it?
I thought about getting out.
Get out?
You can do such things well.
Kaneki!
Get up.
Or lie down.
What will you choose?
If you are a girl, no one will touch you.
And now ...
Oh my.
What?
Only a girl?
Bastard!
You are weak, Toka.
Like our father.
Father fought for us.
What did you do to him?
I'm sorry, Toka.
I'm sorry, Toka.
I'm sorry, Toka.
I'm sorry, Toka.
Father fought for us.
What do you understand?
It's you who don't understand, Toka.
Mother and father died.
They didn't save anyone.
They were just killed.
But I'm different.
I'll show this to Momosaru.
What is higher than people?
Get down!
You can't fly away with such wings.
Fall and have mercy.
You're cool, Ayato.
Toka!
You still resist?
He really reminds her.
I'm really jealous.
Oh, you're strong.
Then how do you like this?
And this?
And how about this?
Okay, then maybe like this?
And if so?
And so?
Maybe so?
And if so?
Huh?
And so?
Do you like it?
And so?
And maybe so?
Cool.
You'll kill him.
Mr. Yamori,
we'd better...
What?
Cool equipment is right.
Niko.
Oh, cool.
Great.
Let's continue when we get home, Yamori.
Thank you, Niko.
You're welcome.
Banjo, pack one-eyed into the bag.
It's time to go back.
Are you okay?
They took him, didn't they?
Yoma, get everyone together.
Anteika is temporarily closed.
Engine,
we're ready to go.
They started the organized movement.
That's all we know about the Oogiri tree.
I would attack them right now,
but for now it's better to wait.
We'll get rid of them in a week.
Until then, the residents of the 11th district
need to be evacuated urgently.
Without the participation of the police,
I'll deal with the media.
That's all.
Everyone is free.
Yes, sir!
So, is that you, Suzui?
An incredibly handsome guy, right?
Oh, damn it!
You eat well.
The wallet is not empty.
Well, well, Maruo.
Suzui has just returned and is probably tired.
He'll get away with it.
What? I just wanted to talk.
Yes, yes.
Come on tomorrow, okay?
Suzui,
Suzui is an investigator of the 3rd rank.
Maruo uses everyone he wants.
He probably decided that Juzo would be useful to us.
No matter what,
the chairman himself recognized him as yours.
I'm Arima.
Yes.
You know, the enemy also has enough problems.
Are you about Jason?
Yes.
He's a level 13th district smuggler,
a sadist who likes to kill for fun.
I really want to catch him.
Exactly.
Have you already fought with him, Amon?
Yes, with Mr. Mada.
I see.
And what's wrong with this guy in Moscow, friend?
Please,
don't make me kill!
His words and facial expressions,
they reminded me of what I wanted to forget.
Kutaro,
who allowed you to enter?
Amon!
Amon!
I'm sorry.
Repeat again.
They say your instrument is broken.
Yes.
Then take the one that was with Mada.
He wouldn't mind.
Well, see you.
Mr. Mada.
Rei,
it looks like there are a lot of ghouls in the 11th district.
They can give me a new instrument.
I'm looking forward to it.
I need to behave well,
otherwise my mom will get angry again.
CCG has begun to increase the number of investigators in the 11th district
and look for local ghouls.
I'm sure that when this case is closed,
only the question of time will remain.
But isn't the forced evacuation of the residents of this district
too much?
It's all for the common good.
CCG protects people.
So I ask everyone not to enter the closed area.
Can you at least write Koneki?
Koneki.
Hinami?
Sister.
He's not like that, a rag as it seems.
Nishiki.
It looks like everyone is in the assembly.
They'll come soon, but let's get started.
This concerns the situation that touched the 11th district
and the actions that Anteiko will take.
But before that, I would like to say something
about the kidnapped Koneki.
You'd better make up with the fact that we won't see him again.
Hey, old man!
Don't you dare say that!
Stop it!
Stop it!
We're going to save him, aren't we?
Yeah!
In the tree of Aogiri, there are ghouls who live only for battles.
It's not easy to get into their lair and save Koneki.
No, it can't be!
Moreover, we must not forget about CCG.
Surely soon they will send reinforcements to the 11th district
to destroy the members of the tree of Aogiri.
If we go to save him,
they can destroy us and themselves.
Hey, come on!
You don't want to leave him, do you?
I'll go.
Remember the girl from this cafe?
If you don't go, boss,
I'll go alone.
I'm going too.
I owe him.
I want to help too.
My brother has always helped me, so...
I'll do everything I can,
Hinami.
Let me explain everything.
I wanted to save Koneki anyway.
However, you know, I don't guarantee that you will survive.
I understand your feelings.
If you want to save Koneki, you will have to risk your life.
In return, we will defend you to the last.
After all, the girls of Santeiko, help each other.
And something else.
Come in.
You? Why?
Amor.
Horrible.
Just imagine.
My best friend Koneki got into the hands of some bunch of bastards.
No.
It's not funny.
Moving on.

Thank you for watching!
Thank you for watching!
Jiro, what do you think? What does Risa think of me?
Why so suddenly?
If you want to like her, how about a gift?
A gift?
Well, I can't ask her directly.
I'll spoil the whole surprise.
I'll have to do it myself.
Well, I'll have to do it myself.
Well, I'll have to do it myself.
Well, I'll have to do it myself.
I'll spoil the whole surprise.
I'll have to do it myself.
Well, I'll have to do it myself.
Risa, Risa, can I ask you something?
She said she adores the insides.
I see.
Thank you.
