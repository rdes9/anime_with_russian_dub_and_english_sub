Ice-cold?
More precisely, first degree.
A little more and you're frozen to death.
If you stay in the cold for a long time with ordinary auto armor,
the tissue attached to the metal will get ice-cold.
And in order to move normally, you need special oil.
It seems that Bacanir did not have a problem with auto armor.
I have a problem, Doc, this can is stuck.
Oh, my head!
And here in the north you need light mobility,
and the main thing is frost-resistant armor.
By trial and error, we managed to find a suitable composition
of duralumin, carbon fiber and neodymium.
So that's why the destruction of the car armor did not work.
Doc, maybe it's not worth telling our secrets, who got it?
It's not who got it.
He is a state alchemist.
Seriously?
You have a silver watch.
Such an old lady is already a major.
If you plan to stay here for a long time, I advise you to change the car armor.
Do you have your mechanic?
She is now in Rashville.
Her client went to the north, and she did not even warn you.
Well, actually, I did not tell her that I was going to the north.
You have to change the car armor, of course, if you do not want to die.
Okay.
Three hundred cents for coffee.
Robbery?
Even in the eastern headquarters, coffee was better.
You always have to be on check here.
So, what did you do all this way with ordinary car armor for?
And why didn't they tell us about your arrival from the headquarters?
Didn't they tell you?
I had a letter to the general lieutenant, and I wanted to ask her for help,
but this woman did not even listen to us and threatened to tear out my antenna.
Did you call me, red shrimp?
Red?
If you are dissatisfied with something, say it directly.
My hair.
There are no more of them.
Ebizo 34, Snow Queen.
So you are friends of my younger brother, Alex.
How is he doing?
Well, his muscles are still huge.
He's fine.
I'm glad for him.
Now tell me what brought you to me.
And explain why there is no one inside these armor.
I would not want strangers to hear this.
Don't worry, many people have something to hide here.
It's normal that you have your own antenna.
But if they find out, they can put me in court.
I've done a lot of things like that too.
Listen, brother.
It looks like we have to tell her everything.
But Inri has hostages.
I think we can tell her about everything except the Fuhrer and the homunculi.
What are you talking about?
Stop wasting my time.
Okay, let's tell her the story about the return of our bodies.
I see.
So this is why you are looking for this girl with a black and white cat.
Now I understand.
So you will help us?
I'm just an ordinary woman.
I don't think about the consequences.
You break the rules and spread chaos around you.
I don't want people like you to live in my fortress.
And why in the capital allow such annoying children to run without supervision?
Get out of here!
That's what I wanted to tell you.
But I was interested in Rentatsu.
You know this girl, don't you?
Technology that is not yet in our country.
I don't want it.
New technology is always on the rise.
Gold, especially here on the border with Drachma.
If you believe in your words, Rentatsu can become a powerful weapon.
You don't understand.
Rentatsu is a technique based on medicine.
Shut up!
You don't understand this with a hat enjoying peaceful life in the capital.
You don't understand.
Don't forget that your peace is guarded by those who defend the border.
I have been here in line in the northern border and I will go to anything to defend it.
We will look for this girl Rentatsu.
And you will wait in the fortress.
Major Miles.
Find them a job.
Who doesn't work, he doesn't eat.
You won't argue.
These guys have gone through a lot.
It seems that they have experience, but inside they are still children.
And it is obvious that they told us the whole truth.
Hey, what kind of job are you going to give us?
The doctor said that everyone here has something to hide.
What about you?
It turns out that we are the only ones who have revealed our secret here.
This is not fair.
Do you really want to know?
Red eyes! Ishiwarite?
But how? I heard that all Ishiwarites were fired from the army before the start of the campaign for destruction.
Yes, I have Ishiwar blood flowing in me.
But my father, grandmother and even my wife belong to a different race.
I inherited the color of the skin and the eyes from my grandfather.
Amistritsa, you brought the death and destruction to the land of my ancestors.
Ishiwarites burned down our city and killed our parents and our friend.
Don't, brother.
That's right.
For the first time, someone dared to answer me like that.
Did you check us?
No, sorry.
After the war, they constantly look at me with pity, as if I was their colleague.
To be honest, I'm pretty tired of this, but you're not like that.
I just had something to do with Ishiwarites.
They wanted to kill me, they barely kidnapped me.
But it didn't stop us from finding common language.
I thought a lot about it and realized that regardless of race, all people are equal.
Major Miles, have you served in the army since the campaign started?
Yes.
Yes, I was a lieutenant general.
The campaign started immediately after I was transferred here.
My grandfather and other Ishiwarite relatives were killed in the east.
But the transfer saved me from cleaning the army.
You probably hate the army.
Do you like to ask such questions?
I asked this because I was tired of my own ignorance.
I'm sorry if it bothered you.
A state alchemist who doesn't know.
Yes, I hated the army and didn't even trust the lieutenant general who left me with his adjutant.
Despite my Ishiwarite blood, I take such a position.
This can lead to discord among soldiers.
Why did you leave me?
Once I asked her directly.
Brix, this is a place where you should forget about fear forever.
Always be ready to fight at the command of the commander.
We must be a single army that can't be crushed by anything.
You won't have time to worry about such nonsense on the battlefield.
In your veins, the blood of different peoples flows.
This allows you to look at the world from the opposite point of view.
I was born in Amestris and absorbed by its values.
To achieve the top, you need someone like you.
Stop whining and follow me, Miles.
Her words come from the heart.
There was no drop of lies in them.
Then I asked her,
but what if Ishiwarite blood can't forgive the army of Amestris and thirst for revenge?
Do you know what she answered?
Great, then go ahead.
As a representative of the army, I am always ready to satisfy your thirst for revenge.
That's it.
What a terrible woman.
Is it easy to say such a thing when there is a whole army behind you?
No, I remember as of now.
I'll crush you with my own hands.
That's what her eyes said.
Do you already know the law of Brix?
The strongest survives, right?
That's right.
The weak die, the strong survive.
This is our reality.
24 hours, all 365 days a year.
Everything is very simple.
In Brix, there is no division of the name, nation and gender.
This is also a kind of survival of the strongest.
You are alive because you are lucky.
Again these ice cleaners are talking.
This is your job.
When you finish, we'll find you something else.
Damn it.
I can't get it.
I can't get it.
I can't get it.
Damn it.
I can't believe my eyes.
Foreman Farman?
Brother Elric?
How did you get here?
Didn't you transfer to the Northern Staff?
Yes, but then I was sent here.
So you are already a junior lieutenant?
Yes.
I must congratulate you.
But why are you beating up the nipples?
Do you have to do such a dirty job?
It doesn't look like a successful career.
Don't even remind me.
This is the level of development.
Wow, what is this?
This is the idea of General Armstrong.
We collect the latest technology and improve weapons.
And the autobron too?
Yes, let's continue the tour.
Let's go.
This is the lower level of the bricks.
It's so hot here.
Especially compared to the upper floors.
All vital arteries and fortresses are gathered here.
Even if we are attacked on the surface, the heart of the bricks will remain harmless.
Hey, you, get out of the way.
Don't get under my feet.
I'm sorry.
Bobby, come here.
Listen.
This sound ...
... comes from under the ground.
What?
As if someone is digging a tunnel.
Are these the hands of the drachmas?
Are they digging a tunnel under our fortress?
They are approaching.
I'm tired of it.
I'm tired of it.
I'm tired of it.
I'm dying of boredom.
It's so boring to die.
It's so boring to die.
Full metal alchemist.
Full metal alchemist.
Fullmetal alchemist.
Zolf J. Kimble.
It seems that he was heavily wounded in a freight train that followed here.
He was placed in the hospital at the foot of Yegor.
He asks Briggs to provide complete assistance.
Shouldn't the full metal alchemist be in prison?
Recently he was released on orders of the Fuhrer.
I don't like it.
What's the matter?
The lower level is attacked.
What?
It doesn't start until it stops.
Come on, let's make a long shot.
Come on.
Who are you?
I'm digging a hole.
I'm tired of it.
I'm tired of it.
I'm tired of it.
I'm tired of it.
I'm tired of it.
I'm tired of it.
I'm tired of it.
I'm tired of it.
I'm tired of it.
I'm tired of it.
I'm tired of it.
I'm tired of it.
I'm tired of it.
I'm tired of it.
Stop, is he really...
It seems that neither father nor Fuhrer has told him about us yet.
You bastards!
After all, you are spies of Drachma!
Wow!
Then why did you talk so nicely with our guest?
We didn't talk!
I won't buy your lies anymore!
We're not lying, just...
Stop!
The big room.
I don't need to dig anymore.
Fire!
It's not being pulled by bullets?
Where am I?
Damn, it's rising at the level of development!
Warn them!
Let's go there!
Damn!
You're huge!
It's hot here!
Don't move!
Put out the fire!
Yes, sir!
I'm sure it's hit him!
Boss, forget about it! Our weapons are no match for him!
What did you say?
Take the civilians out of here!
And finally turn off the alarm!
You can't let Drachma find out what's going on here!
Boss, we're ready!
Have you already tested them?
There's no need for that!
The guys who built them know their business!
Great! I'll personally lead the attack!
Yes, sir!
The main weapon for the fight is ready!
Fire!
Direct hit!
Yes, sir!
It hurts!
I'm sick and tired of this pain!
What are you waiting for?
Charge!
Fire!
Fire!
It hurts!
I remembered my job!
Dig holes!
It's useless, General!
It doesn't matter how many times you kill him, he won't die!
He won't die?
What does that mean? How do you know that?
Well, I...
There's no time to be silent about your game!
Answer the questions you can answer!
How do you know him?
How do you know him?
How do you know him?
How do you know him?
Answer the questions you can answer!
How do you know him?
Are you a spy, Drachma?
No!
Is he a spy?
I don't think so!
Does he know you?
I don't think so!
What is he?
I can't say that!
Whose order is he following?
I can't say that!
Why?
I can't say that!
Try to understand!
Last question!
Are you on our side?
I don't want anyone to die here!
What has his body made of?
Elements that are part of his body are the same as humans!
The same as humans?
Buccaneer!
Bring the fuel for the tank!
And burn our guest!
Yes!
It won't work, General!
Even if we burn him, he won't die!
I understood that he can't be killed during the last attack!
And if the enemy can't be killed, he just needs to be immobilized!
I use the power that is stronger than fire against him!
I will show you the true power of Briggs!
