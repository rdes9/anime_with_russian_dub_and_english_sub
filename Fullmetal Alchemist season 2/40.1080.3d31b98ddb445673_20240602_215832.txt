So you think that Lieutenant General Armstrong put his hand on the disappearance of General Raven?
Very likely, but I'm sure she didn't leave a trace.
That's for sure.
Well, our task is to take control of the fortress.
While this forest was called to the capital by the tiger on the slope.
Is this General General Armstrong himself?
I can't believe you broke into the capital.
What strings did you have to pull?
Or maybe I'm here thanks to my talent and ability?
Freshly given.
What do I owe your presence?
His Excellency called me.
I doubt that I will be able to return to Brix in the near future.
In the near future?
In that case, I just have to invite you to dinner.
Will you treat me?
I don't mind if you're not afraid to go bankrupt.
Then I'm afraid nothing will come out.
I see.
And the purse and the eggs are all with peas.
And what about flowers?
I know one excellent florist.
Seriously?
Come in.
Yes, sir.
So, General-Lieutenant Armstrong.
I'm waiting for an explanation about the disappearance of General Raven.
What have you done to him?
It seems to be better to speak directly.
How could such a great man trust this destruction of Raven?
You eliminated him.
You don't need him.
A brainless and chatty soldier can not help in achieving your goal.
What did Raven tell you?
About the immortal army, about the history of this country and about your past.
I didn't even have to ask him.
And knowing this, you were not afraid to show up here?
Yes.
Let me take over this pathetic joke.
I'm curious, I like it.
Okay, you'll get his place.
But in return for the control of the Empire, you will have to pay the price.
In return, the control over Briggs will go to my people, agree?
As you wish.
My subordinates are excellent soldiers, I personally prepared each of them.
And they are at your disposal.
Very curious.
Welcome aboard, man.
You can't climb into the tigris of Logov, you can't drag Tigret.
And the Lieutenant General went straight to this Logov.
Yes, now they are the masters here.
But they do not understand that even in the absence of their leader, we are an organism with a single will and consciousness.
This is the real power of Briggs.
The tiger and the bear will soon meet in a deadly trap.
Episode 40.
The creature from the probirka, the homunculus.
Are you busy there?
No.
How are you doing at work?
As you can see.
Now I can't relax even for lunch.
And you?
Now I have more to do than before.
But his superiority is also not sitting idle and does not lag behind work like someone.
It seems that our conversation did not go in the right direction.
By the way,
Shran is now in the north.
And the Elric brothers too.
That's how.
My friends from the academy.
Lucy and Jan serve there.
They tell me a lot about what?
By the way, in the spring there will be a joint study of the Northern and Eastern armies.
Yes, I often remember the joint work with Major Miles and Captain Buccaneer.
Miles.
Buccaneer.
York.
Ida.
Sugar.
Havok.
Oscar.
Mike.
Uni.
Nora.
Charlie.
And again Uni.
Then Lucy.
Then again Uni and ...
Starling.
Selim Bradley Gamunco.
Can this be?
Or can it?
What the hell is going on here?
Hey, are you home?
I'm not sleeping.
Don't be afraid.
Come here.
Why?
Well, shouldn't you be surprised at least a little bit?
If I am surprised, then what will I get for this?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
What will I get for this?
I love honest guys.
What's your name?
Number 23.
I was asking for a name, not a number.
I don't have a name.
I'm a slave.
A slave?
A man without rights and freedoms that can be sold and changed as his property.
Property?
A thing that can be passed on.
I see you're a complete fool.
Shut up.
I don't understand how I could appear from someone like you.
You're the one who gave me your blood, aren't you?
They took a lot of blood from me for their experiments.
So you gave me life.
Thank you.
Eh?
Well...
RAT number 23 sounds a little off.
I'll give you a real name.
Who are you?
Don't you want a good name?
Well, let's see...
Teo...
Teofast Bombast.
Too long.
Eh?
That's right.
A fool like you can't remember such a long name.
Stop calling me.
Okay.
Van...
Van Hohenheim.
Van Hohenheim?
I think I can remember it.
It's written as...
Wait, can you write?
It's not required for my job.
For a slave's job?
Don't you dream of freedom?
Or do you want to be a slave until the end of your life without even having your own will?
Such existence is no different from mine.
In the test...
I can give you knowledge, Van Hohenheim.
But...
But what are you?
What?
Do you have a name?
I am an existence from the test.
Call me Gamun, Cool.
All things come from one and come back to their beginning.
In other words, one has everything.
Everything exists thanks to one.
And inside one there is everything.
There will be no whole and no components.
You have passed.
You have become a real alchemist, Hohenheim.
But as long as I am no more than an assistant,
I am still far from my teacher.
I am so grateful to you.
For what?
My life has become wonderful thanks to the knowledge that I have received from you.
Even the Lord constantly praises me.
Maybe one day I will be able to see you again.
Even the Lord constantly praises me.
Maybe one day I will get married and I will have my own family.
Family?
It seems that it is not easy to be a human.
In your view, you have to unite in society and multiply to survive.
Don't say that.
Perhaps it seems stupid to you, but people are happy.
When they have a family and comrades.
This is what makes us people.
Well, if you say so.
Then what would make you happy?
Well, maybe I'm asking too much,
but if I had the opportunity to leave this test, I would be happy.

Immortality.
What else do you want from an idiot who has infinite power and power?
Choose an expression.
You speak to the king himself.
If you allow yourself this again, I will break your test.
And destroy what you have been working on all this time?
Enough talking.
Immortality is just a dream or reality.
Are you afraid of old age?
How sad the Lord is like a heart.
Okay, I'll tell you the secret of eternal life.
What are you digging here?
Irrigation system.
The king ordered to dig a giant channel around the country.
The king is a great man.
He always cares about ordinary people.
Exactly.
Is it clear to kill everyone?
Yes.
Hurry up.
Put a bloody seal on the land of Xerxes.
The city in the north was attacked.
I heard no one survived.
And recently the same thing happened in the east.
Who is behind all this?
How terrible.
And don't talk.
Your Majesty, the transformation circle is ready.
I've been waiting for this for so long.
Can I start now?
Oh yes, you will soon become immortal.
Amazing, the king will become immortal.
Awesome! The king will become immortal!
This is the beginning of a new era!
Is this immortality?
What is this?
You promised that nothing would happen to those who are in the center of the circle!
What? What's going on? Answer me, Homunculus!
You are in the true center of the Transforming Circle!
What?
I used the blood that you gave me to open the gate!
The man who shared the blood with me is Hohenheim!
Now we are in the center of the whole thing!
Hohenheim!
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty!
Is he dead?
Is there anyone here?
Willard? Mitchell? Linemail? Tony?
Maya!
Is there anyone here? Please answer me!
You are wasting your time! No one of them has a soul left!
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty!
You are still alive!
What do you say?
How do you like my new body?
It's me!
I used the information from your blood to create a new container for you!
And finally I can walk on my own feet!
So it's you?
Homunculus!
What happened? What did you do?
Thanks for the blood I gave you a name!
I gave you knowledge!
And finally I give you immortality!
Immortality?
Try to focus on your feelings!
Do you hear their voices?
The voices of people who lived in this country and were sacrificed for you to get an immortal body!
Although I used half of them for myself!
Thank you for everything, Hohenheim!
Hohenheim?
Is it really you?
I didn't think you were the father of Ed and Ava!
I didn't expect you to be their teacher either!
They must have caused you a lot of trouble!
No, what are you talking about?
Izumi-san!
How are you, Izumi?
Tablets! Tablets!
Let me take a look!
I'm a little good at medicine!
Don't worry, I'm okay!
No, you're definitely not okay!
Zik-san, please drive the car here!
Quickly!
Yes, I'll be right there!
Izumi-san!
You saw the truth, didn't you?
What did you pay for it?
Please trust me!
It took part of my internal organs!
I tried to resurrect my child!
I see!
That's how it is!
Don't move!
Izumi, hold on!
Izumi!
Calm down, darling, I'm okay!
He devoured your stomach!
Now I can breathe so easily!
Yes, I can see the wound!
There's nothing there!
Are you crazy?
What you lost symbolizes your sin!
And I can't get it back!
But I rebuilt your insides so that the blood could circulate freely through them!
Izumi-san, it's too early for you to die!
Hohenheim!
What the hell are you?
I'm Van Hohenheim!
The Philosopher's Stone,
who was given
the appearance of a human!
Hohenheim!
Hohenheim!
Hohenheim!
Hohenheim!
Hohenheim!
Hohenheim!
Hohenheim!
Hohenheim!
Hohenheim!
Hohenheim!
Hohenheim!
Hohenheim!
Hohenheim!
Don't let go of me...
Because I have the warmth from your right hand and I consolidates it firmly...
The Transcendent Stone. The Philosopher's Stone. Great Elixir...
There are many names for this stone, and it does not necessarily have the shape of a stone.
The one I saw from Dr. Mark was like jelly.
And Kimble, he resembles a crystal of this size.
After all the talks about the power of the stone, I imagined it to be huge.
I have never seen it bigger than an egg.
To create a really big stone, you need to sacrifice a hell of a lot of people.
I would not want to see such a thing once.
To get something, you need to replace it with something equal.
That is the main law of alchemy, and this law always and everywhere.
Next in the alchemist, episode 41, hell.
Pain, soar for the soft-heartedness of the boy.
