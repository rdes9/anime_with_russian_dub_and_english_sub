The sun is a symbol of the male beginning, and the moon is a symbol of the female beginning.
The fusion of the sun and the moon represents the unity of the male and the female beginning, in other words, the perfect man.
What do you think, is it talking about immortality here?
I think it's something bigger.
Bigger?
Yes, for example, God.
Yes, come out!
Now even you cannot stop me!
I will not throw you from heaven to earth and you will become a part of me!

Are you all right?
What happened?
You played your part brilliantly!
You did it after all!
Yes, I swallowed God himself!
God? This is impossible!
It is possible when you have enough energy!
Energy?
A philosophical stone!
It can't be!
Did he bring a whole country to the victim?
How many people did you kill?
The population of Amestris is about 50 million people.
Episode 61, the killer of the gods.
Son of a bitch!
That's shit!
I sealed the alchemy!
Goodbye, friends!
That's it!
By the power of the Lord God, I can even create the sun in my own palm!
Do you want to feel the heat on yourself?
Our counterattack began at the very moment when you swallowed what you glorify as God.
I have been preparing for this day for many years.
I left parts of my philosophical stone to my comrades all over the perimeter of your circle.
The time has come!
The boy from the check-in went far too far.
There is nowhere for our souls to return, but the bodies of the inhabitants of Amestris are still alive.
Yes, we must free and return their souls.
Hoenheim is counting on us!
But you scattered your philosophical stone around the country, what's wrong with that?
Without the right circle, you will not be able to transform anything!
This is the basis of alchemy!
I have a circle!
When the time comes, they will activate it themselves!
And in this moment, the unimaginable power will fall from the sky!
This is the shadow of the moon that covers the earth during the eclipse!
Farewell, Hoenheim!
You will not dare, Hoenheim!
That's why I'm here!
My friend from the check-in, Gamuncul!
Gamuncul!
Gamuncul!
Gamuncul!
Are you okay, Winry?
What was it?
Did we lose consciousness?
Are you Pinako-san too?
I think so.
What happened?
Was it really a dream?
I was as if pulled into a mad whirlpool of pain and suffering.
Did it work?
The souls of the inhabitants of Amestris have returned to their bodies.
And the remains of the stone, created in Xerxes, are unlikely to be enough to withstand the power of the so-called god.
I need to create philosophical stones all over again!
And no matter how many souls are required, 100 million or a billion,
we are at the disposal of vast fields for harvest!
Mei!
The ability to feel and control the flows of energy flowing in the earth is the basis of orientanjutsu,
and the more powerful these flows are, the more power I can use!
Uncle, from behind!
Damn!
I don't have time to reflect his attacks!
Please hold on!
Otherwise, the protective barrier will collapse!
I won't let you!
Hold on, dad!
Oh, you old bastard! Don't you dare lose to him!
Now I have no choice!
Even if I failed to become your real father, I can still show my boys how cool I am!
If he doesn't hurry, the power of the philosophical stone will be stung by dad!
Move, Shram!
Ishvarit!
Hasn't alchemy offended the creator of all things, Ishvar?
Have you really turned away from your god?
Or have you decided that you are human?
Are you allowed to act according to his laws?
No!
The horrors of civil war!
Have you sown seeds of doubt in your heart?
And now you have realized it!
There is no god!
No!
I have never believed in gods or in their power.
But it seems that it is in such situations that people say,
God turned away from me!
No other way than by the will of heaven it turned out to be you!
Have you come to avenge your grandfather?
Well, of course!
The last word?
No!
What kind of pathetic creatures are you?
Is there really no one left who was dear to you, King Bradley?
Companions? Wife?
Wife?
Is there really no word for her to say goodbye?
When she finds out that you were a homunculus?
Girl, do not allow such stupid words as love or sorrow to slip out of your lips!
Remember who I am!
I chose this woman myself!
And such nonsense as my farewell words are useless to her!
After all, she is not an ordinary person, but the wife of the king!
Well, while we were talking so nicely, you missed your chance to avenge!
All my life I had to go through the script written in advance,
but thanks to you, people, until the very end I had an interesting, full-fledged life!
I still feel life energy!
This is a philosophical stone!
This?
How are you?
Help me get there!
But the circle is already ruined!
It does not matter!
There must be a center!
Brother!
The thirst for revenge that has been burning in me all these years is still alive!
But I still intend to save such a hateful maestris!
You said that the world leads in movement positive and negative flows!
But I still intend to save such a hateful maestris!
You said that the world leads in movement positive and negative flows!
And now they will both cry in me!
To what shore will the madman who dived into the water turn?
Come on!
Come on!
Well, did you bite?
The throne on which you sat so proudly turned into dust!
And now it's your turn, scum!
I will give you and your fucking truth!

Is that Rintanjutsu?
No.
This is the result of my brother's research.
The beard studied alchemy for a long time.
And then Rintanjutsu Ksing became interested.
Rintanjutsu uses the energy of the magnetic field of the earth.
And the origin of the power that alchemists of the maestris use is attributed to the earth's crust.
But my brother noticed that people cannot fully use this energy.
He began to suspect that there is another link between the crust and alchemists.
I have a bad feeling that I was constantly tested here.
As if under the ground people are coughing instead of insects.
Yes.
Surely this was an underground network for creating a philosophical stone.
Here you are, here you are, take it!
Did you create a transforming circle to return souls to all people?
Yes, and it worked.
The reverse transforming circle activated by Shuram removed the seal from alchemy.
In his research, brother Shuram realized that a terrible secret was hidden behind the alchemy of the maestris.
Finally, he figured out the existence of an underground transforming circle.
He took the circle that entwined the country as the basis and neutralized the action of the stone with the formula of Rintanjutsu.
After the activation of this circle, the energy sealed by the stone can be used completely.
Continue to attack!
Make him use the stone!
He will run out of energy soon!
And when will it be over?
I don't know, but this is our only chance!
Take it!
It reminds me of how I had to swim in this lagoon.
Now it's your turn, bastard!
Get out of there, Grit!
Don't move!
Turn slowly!
Lieutenant Hokai?
Major!
What the hell?
Bastard! He decided to replenish the strength of his stone!
Follow them!
Yes!
You need to be taken to a safer place.
Sorry, there is no such thing as a safe place at the moment.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Please, leave me alone at this crucial moment.
Brother!
Go without me!
I think this bastard has something to do with me.
Let's go, Alf!
Don't think about losing, Ed!
Yes!
Dear?
Izumi!
Okay, it's not the time to talk.
Take care of the colonel.
Of course!
Colonel!
We have to catch the guy who hit the top!
You're wounded, colonel!
I've lost my sight.
Lieutenant, how's your neck?
You again for your own!
You need to think about yourself now, colonel!
Colonel, your eyes!
Can you still fight?
Yes, sir!
Young master!
I'll go after him!
You've been following me all the time!
One!
You're still dead?
And with such a happy face!
I'm so pissed off!
I had to fall so low
to spit on my pride, Gamunkula Grit!
Why do you even obey this father?
What kind of stupid question is that?
Shouldn't children listen to their parents?
Who's the fool here?
It's you!
Listen, you say?
You're just a puppet
unable to think with your own head!
I can't understand
why you let him wipe his feet!
You're one step away from death,
but he didn't even look at you
during the whole time of the battle!
So what?
Don't try to judge us, Gamunkula,
according to your harmful human standards!
The vessel my father gave me is ruined!
Your blood flows too,
the blood of Hohenheim,
the blood that gave life to our father!
We are all brothers!
Edward Elric!
Your flesh will be my new vessel!
What?
That won't do!
I won't let you do this,
Gamunkul Pride!
Kimbley, it's impossible!
No one can save you
in this whirlwind of walled souls!
In this whirlwind?
Who am I to you?
Desperate shouts and walls
are just music for my ears!
What the hell are you doing in the forest, Kimbley?
Well, actually,
if you continued to fight in your old container,
I would stay out of it.
But after all this bravado
about the pride of Gamunkul and other crap,
being tied to the wall,
you immediately tried to get into the body of a person,
a creature that you despise so much!
You...
are pathetic!
You...
are despicable!
Why am I here?
Oh, come on,
he's about to kill me!
You have no idea, Edward Elric!
ì•„
Solen!
Now you're mine, Selim!
No!
Stop it!
Stop it!
So this is your true form?
You still have to ask Madame Bradley for forgiveness?
For now, wait here, silly Selim!
