Drink it.
Pinocchio?
You don't mind if I drink?
No.
The goal is to become a metal alchemist.

Episode 27
Beer near the cliff
Well, sometimes it's just the way it should be.
Maybe you think we're the safest people on Earth.
But is it possible to judge us?
And this country is constantly at war with someone.
Now you've got something to do with this mess.
Can't you do without it?
No matter how many times this story is repeated, it doesn't teach anything.
People are really stupid, pathetic creatures.
Episode 28
Add other messes here and there.
How is it all run in the East?
Not only the East.
The messes of border wars are raging in the North and West.
Now the border clashes of Saruga in the South and Crete in the West do not stop.
Now the border clashes of Saruga in the South and Crete in the West do not stop.
And in the North, the Drahma Empire is just waiting for the moment.
And there are whole mountains of corpses everywhere.
Yes.
So not far before the coup.
Oh, it's scary to live here.
The transformation of the country into a militaristic state
began with the arrival of the power of King Bradley.
Let's dance.
And you take advantage of the popularity of the Hoennheim girls.
Why don't you dance alone?
It's not fun at all.
This uncle is too proud to dance.
Go dance with those girls.
I wonder how old they were.
When they first thought about such things as the transformation of man.
Who, unlike you, their father was supposed to talk to them about this?
No one.
And you're cruel.
Sin is sin.
Damn it!
He took her!
Someone help!
Mom!
Mommy!
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
Mommy!
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
This is my fault!
Alfons!
Damn!
Damn!
Give him back!
He is my younger brother!
Take anything! Legs, hands, even my heart!
Just give him back!
He is my only brother!
A divine stone that destroyed Xerxes in one night!
With its help, we will be able to return your body, Alf!
Doctor, what exactly did you order to investigate?
A philosophical stone!
Forget about it!
This is a devil's study!
Studying them, you will go through all the circles of hell!
Devil's research, knowledge that should not have been sought!
This knowledge is monstrous, Mark!
The raw material for the philosophical stone is living people!
What a pitiful creatures they are!
They are so afraid of the dark that they cannot even resist it!
And instead they try to forget and run away from reality at least for a while!
People are too weak!
Humans...
Well, why don't we use them as a shield?
They are too weak!
Humans...
Well, why don't we use them as a shield?
They are too weak!
Humans...
Well, why don't we use them as a shield?
They are too weak!
Humans...

You may be able to see the true truth hidden behind the truth!
What the hell? Did you really use it to create the Philosopher's Stone?
Show me what you're capable of!
This hand saved your life, but my blade cuts even steel!
What the hell? Did you really use it to create the Philosopher's Stone?
Oh, bro!
It's a shame to admit, but we lost.
Hey, you won't say that now, will you? In fact, we're a trio, right?
No, no, now it's over, kid.
I won't kill a man.
Do you think we're people?
If I don't consider you people, it will turn out that I don't recognize a man from my younger brother.
My younger brother is a man, so you two are the same.
That's why I can't kill you.
Bro!
As far as I remember, my brother and I only did what we did, robbing, destroying and killing.
And now, when we turned into this, we were first accepted for people.
Interesting.
I'll tell you everything, kid. This will be my farewell gift.
The one who created the Philosopher's Stone and ordered us to guard this place, he...
We almost got caught.
You're talking too much, 48.
You're pissing me off, you idiot!
You almost killed our precious victim!
Did you even think what you were doing, huh?
Who the hell are you?
What the hell is the plan?
What the hell is the victim?
You're a precious victim, aren't you?
Yes, that's right. I'm a precious victim.
What could that mean?
The teacher of the Pizoumi Curtis brothers also has potential.
I'm sorry.
Although you are a candidate for a precious victim, you will have to die.
I thought a lot.
What does a precious victim mean?
What do you want to make me do?
Rebellion in Leora.
People as material for the Philosopher's Stone.
War in Ishvara.
Oh my, who's behind all this?
Right now you're turning the country into a huge alchemical circle that uses people's lives.
Does this circle serve me to create the Philosopher's Stone?
Did you really know about this?
Honheim, why didn't you tell anyone?
Honheim!
Even if I told you, nothing would have changed.
What?
I've seen it more than once.
People repeat their mistakes from the past without even trying to learn from them.
And then they run away with nothing to fix.
People are pathetic creatures.
Didn't I tell you?
The Philosopher's Stone is my heart.
I'm Homuncul.
You already know, aren't you, artificially created people?
I'm one of them.
We're going to die here anyway.
I'll show you something interesting in the end.
Can I eat it?
Mustangu!
Oh, it's you.
Mustangu!
There was another monster hiding in this monster's stomach.
It swallows everything around.
So alchemy can even create something like this.
Who are you, old man?
Just like you have an absolute shield.
I have an absolute eye.
Here it is like a fuse.
When you said there was a big trouble with the army.
You meant the danger that threatens the army.
Father, do you have a father?
I do.
Did he create Homuncul?
Created?
People don't have an absolute blade or an absolute shield.
Moreover, they don't have an absolute sword or an absolute shield.
Moreover, the slightest failure can put them in a deadlock from which they can no longer get out.
What can these creatures do against Homuncul?
What do you think they can do?
But we will not give up!
We will never give up!
That's another feature of humans.
How can you fight with wounds like that?
I burned them.
However, I almost broke out a couple of times.
No matter how many times you do it, you will not win.
Maybe you'll tell me your secret?
Hi.
Thank you.
Now that the blood has come out of my head, my thoughts have become clear.
Will you resist further? Then lie down, you bitch!
Shut up!
Yes, it's not easy to live with such a body.
But it doesn't make me feel sorry at all.
You have nothing to feel sorry for me.
I'm still alive thanks to the alchemy of my brother.
To renounce yourself means to renounce my brother and alchemy.
But I believe in the power of alchemy.
I want to believe in it.
This is a state alchemist!
Lie down!
Hold on! Don't you dare die!
The curse of blood does not stop!
Anyone!
Live! You can't die!
Renfan! Run!
Renfan!
Run!
My left hand!
What's wrong with her?
Young master! Now I'm useless!
Renfan!
Stop!
Impressive!
It doesn't matter how many times we step back.
It doesn't matter how many times we fall and get up and keep going.
This fight is useless.
But until you try, you won't know.
It's better than sitting with your hands folded.
Or do you agree with this?
If this is alchemy, the rest will disappear.
I found something to worry about.
Even if we help people now.
Sooner or later, they will die anyway.
It's just an empty waste of power.
Don't you think it would be wiser to take everything that is expensive and run away?
What are you?
Are you tormented by conscience or useless feelings?
Wenhai!
Wenhai!
No matter how hard you try, no one will accept you.
Look at your face!
People like you are excavated.
If you don't use them for some time, they will recover.
Why do you need to do something?
Will it change anything?
Will you be able to change reality?
Will you be able to make weak people strong?
We can change.
We will definitely change.
I'm sure.
We are really weak.
But we can do everything to become stronger.
Even if it seems useless to you.
Every little step brings us closer to something big.
They will protect those who are dear to them.
Can a little man do that?
Yes.
But...
I was not ready.
Even Ren Fan was better prepared than me.
Look how people are dying in front of me.
I hate it. I'm tired of it.
I will not allow anyone else to die.
I will protect you.
Damn it, I'll run away.
I will knock out all the shit from this guy who calls himself true and pull your body out of there.
Al!
Al, come here!
Faster, Al!
Alphonse!
Alphonse!
Alphonse!
Wait for me!
That's why I believe that we can change.
Because we are weak.
And we all die one day.
People do everything possible to become stronger.
While your heart is still beating in your chest.
Remember.
The day you spent with us in Rosenburg.
It's just a dream.
Thank you.
