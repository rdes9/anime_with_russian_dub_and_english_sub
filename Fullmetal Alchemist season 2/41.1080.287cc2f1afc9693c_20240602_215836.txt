Metal Alchemist
In the middle of an endless journey,
A time that seems to stop
We sigh and sigh
We tried to grab it, but it was still far away
But now there is nothing to be afraid of
The strong bonds that bind our hearts
Will never be broken
We kept searching
And we arrived
At this place, at this time
The light of sadness
Changes into power
The fate is right next to us
This is...
Dynamite!
Come on!
Ah, everything got wet through here
Don't be afraid, they won't explode anymore
That's it, we move on
The enemies can already follow us
And the truth
It seems the storm has subsided
Get ready for battle
Yes, sir!
We must get rid of Kimble and his two sixes
With the first opportunity
Yes, sir!
Episode 41, hell!
Episode 41, hell!
I need absolute success with complete conspiracy
People from the Northern Staff should also not know anything
But Major Miles!
Saying to get rid of you meant to kill, right?
Of course
We shouldn't kill him right away
Maybe just hurt him and interrogate as we planned before?
Do you believe that he will tell us the truth?
It's too dangerous to leave him alive
Then what about his people?
Surely they are forced to obey him only because they were turned into Kimble?
Probably, but unfortunately probably doesn't mean exactly
So you're going to kill them based only on your suspicions?
Just like General Raven?
There must have been another way
Remember Briggs' law
If you even get yourself in trouble, you will be killed
It is very likely that your kindness will one day destroy you
This land is not a safe place for idiots
If Kimble and his people give us a chance, we will destroy them
He's still a child, really
Indeed
Only fools and children believe that you can survive in this world
But at his age, I also thought so
Like me
But now, after going through so many battles
It is much more difficult to leave someone alive than to kill
So the Elric brothers have chosen the most difficult path
They never look for easy ways, right?
I must confess, I envy them a little
These are the words of Ras Ayan
This is called grass, rejuvenating the body
Perhaps it is connected with a philosophical stone
Let's see
You can turn any metal into gold, and make the old man young again
How do you translate Aurelian?
Gold
Only gold and immortality are spoken here
It's all because Brother Sharamasana studied the Rintenjutsu deeply
What do you mean?
Khingi call immortal people true people
And a true person is a perfect person
Like gold is a perfect metal
That's why sometimes we call true people golden
Khingi
I see, so a true person and gold are the same
They say that the one who taught us alchemy had golden hair and eyes
That's why people considered him immortal
Oh, come on
Golden hair and eyes, just like Ueda and Ala
People, everyone here, I found a way out
It's so bright
Looks like we came out of the opposite side of the mountain
The weather is what we need
So we'll get to Brix in two counts
Listen here, follow me
The snow is much deeper than it seems
Help
Hey, people
Get on my back, baby
Help someone
We'll go ahead and trample the road for you
Thank you
Alfonso
Hey
Hey, help
Is anybody here?
Oh, Alfonso
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god
Are you alive, Al?
I am saved
I turned it off and then I ended up in this dead end
What are you doing here?
I went through the mountains and the storm to find you.
You went through the mountains and the storm?
I see. Instead of going to the entrance, he went straight.
But why was it so risky?
I had to warn you.
Warn you?
Briggs is now under control of the Central Army.
And Lieutenant General Armstrong was sent to the central headquarters.
So now Briggs is too dangerous.
What are we going to do?
We have a way back.
We have to hide somewhere else.
Somewhere, for example?
Follow me.
But where?
There should be an Azbek settlement nearby.
I heard that some of my brothers found a shelter there.
Ishvar ghetto?
Looks like we have no choice.
Brilliant masters.
Let's not waste time.
I'm sure you did the right thing.
What do you mean?
Doesn't Kim Blesan suspect something bad when he sees that you're not there?
Don't worry, brother. He'll figure something out.
Five people from the third squad.
Eight people from the fourth.
Looks like everyone's here.
Everyone, go around the perimeter and start searching.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Let's start.
Yes, sir.
Hey, Alphonse Kuhn.
Shouldn't you have said well?
I'm sorry, Edward Kuhn, but it's so hard to move in this thing.
Of course, thank you for agreeing.
Okay, Kim Blesan's watching.
Wait, brother.
Move it.
Hey, what are Kim Blesan and his people doing here?
Do you see that tall tower in the city center?
They're going to get through it to the mine and check the tunnels.
He said he doesn't trust the local soldiers, so he'll only take people from the capital.
Looks like he figured it out.
We need to stop them.
Tell the snipers to take positions around the tower.
Yes, sir.
Let's go.
Find the entrance to the tunnel.
There should be a lot of tracks around it.
Yes, sir.
Can you take it off?
It's easy from such a distance.
What's going on?
Edward Kuhn.
What?
Kim Blesan, wouldn't it be better to give the check to the British soldiers?
I heard there's a real labyrinth there.
Judging by your desire to stop me, this is the right place.
What are you talking about?
I just want to grab the scar or win time for the snipers to take positions.
How did you know?
There are a lot of people nearby and they're ready to kill them.
How nice is this feeling?
I haven't experienced it since the time of Shvar.
They're talking about something.
What are we going to do, Major?
Can you hit exactly Kim Blesan?
Yes.
Shoot.
Just be careful.
Yes, sir.
Damn it!
Son of a bitch!
He hid in the snow!
Damn it!
Kim Blesan!
What's wrong with you?
So you're a chemist too?
All that alchemist.
www.zolnedap.com
www.zolnedap.com
I can't see shit.
But they won't be able to see me either.
So we're in the same...
You lost the metal target.
When our eyes are useless, our noses allow us to see.
Go to hell!
Metal target!
What happened?
Where are you? Answer me!
Major Miles!
They're chemists and they're prepared to fight in a place with poor visibility.
Stay away from the smoke!
Damn it!
I'm going to fall even lower.
Dynamite?
We're in the mine for a reason.
Calm down, boys.
You know what it is.
Idiot.
He'll never blow up a wet track.
He'll never blow up a wet track.
He'll never blow up a wet track.
He'll never blow up a wet track.
Do you remember what dynamite is made of?
Nitroglycerin, nitroglycol, fragments and...
It seems to be nitrate ammonia.
And what is nitrate ammonia made of?
Incandescent acids and amniac.
Amniac?
Oh my God!
What kind of fight is this?
Amniac?
A sharp smell can play an evil joke with its owner.
These guys are ready.
So that's how you said it when you freed the hostage?
I don't understand what you're talking about.
I'm here only to get information out of you.
Oh my God, you're so excited.
Fighting a young opponent can lead to unwanted consequences.
Besides, I don't have time for games with you.
It seems it's time to use it.
Great, now I don't have to look for it.
So fast?
Too slow!
Now he doesn't have the Philosopher's Stone of the Transforming Circle.
And I won.
Isn't that what you thought now?
The principle is not to kill.
It deserves respect.
But the one who follows him on the battlefield is an easy target for the enemy.
You missed your chance to finish me off.
And for your soft-heartedness you will pay with your life.
To be continued...
Did he destroy the whole tower?
How cruel! Why us?
Damn it!
Kimbley, where are you going?
No, not this one!
Al, what's wrong with you?
Alphonse!
Al?
Not this one.
It's coming off again.
What's coming off?
What's wrong with you, armor boy?
Al?
My soul.
It wants to come back to me.
It wants to come back to me.
It wants to come back to me.
It wants to come back to me.
It wants to come back to me.
My soul.
It wants to come back to me.
Al?
His soul is coming off.
Alphonse!
Has this happened to him before?
I don't know.
Alphonse is on his own.
Wake up, Al.
No, Al.
Al!
What...
What should I do?
Ed!
Ed!
I can't let them cry because of me!
I can't let them cry because of me!
F**k!
F**k you, Kimbley!
Hey, metalhead!
Are you alive there?
Why did you save us?
You're stronger than you look!
Don't get me wrong.
But I need someone to pull this crap out of my belly.
Do you want us to pull this crap out of you?
We had a fight a minute ago.
Yes, please.
But I don't remember we were ordered to kill him.
So...
But if you pull it out of you, it will flood with blood.
As soon as you pull it out, I'll close the wound before I die from blood loss.
Do you have any medical alchemy?
Once I tried to transform a person.
So I read a little about her.
You read a little?
All your innermost thoughts must have turned into porridge.
Without the Philosopher's Stone, like Kimbley, you'll never...
I'm using my life energy instead of the Philosopher's Stone.
What?
Maybe it will shorten my life, but...
Are you sure?
There's no time to doubt.
It happened to me out of my own stupidity.
I messed up. I have to clean up.
I don't know what you want to do, but we really don't have time.
Get ready!
Come on.
You are a stream of life energy.
The same as the Philosopher's Stone.
That's right.
You are the Philosopher's Stone, created from the ground.
You are the Philosopher's Stone, created from the ground.
You are the Philosopher's Stone, created from the ground.
Remember, remember that feeling.
What is it like to use alchemy for your whole life?
Is it a coma after all?
No, damn it, not yet.
So it worked.
I couldn't fully heal myself.
This is no more than the first aid.
I connected the unharmed tissues to stop the bleeding.
It's an emergency.
It's an emergency.
It's an emergency.
It's an emergency.
It's an emergency.
So we need a doctor.
No, we don't have time for that.
Hey, stop!
We need to catch Kimble.
Everyone is in danger.
God, what a fool.
He's struggling in battle, and he barely holds on to his feet.
What's there?
It's the Philosopher's Stone.
The one that was with Kimble?
What the hell do we need him for?
That pervert wanted to kill us.
That's true.
I hope we won't see that bastard again.
Yeah, we're free people now.
We're all sure we're dead.
What are we going to do with him?
We can't let him die.
He saved our lives.
That's right.
We need to take him to the doctor as soon as we find a way out of here.
Uh-huh.
