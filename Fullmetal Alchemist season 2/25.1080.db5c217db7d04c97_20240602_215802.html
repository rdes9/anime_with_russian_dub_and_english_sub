        <pre>White scenery is inviting me now
I'm going to the world I haven't seen yet
A single-metal alchemist
I was lost, I was traveling under the mouse-colored sky
The map of the day
Many dreams were blurred
Someday, even if I'm small
I wonder if I can go beyond those clouds
Like a strong and wounded heart
The raindrops that fell on the ground
Repeatedly
A straight light crosses
I'll keep going
I'll go through anywhere
I'll burn the faint remains in my eyes
No matter where I am under this sky
I'm going to the world I haven't seen yet
Hey, is anybody here?
Al, can you hear me?
Where the hell am I?
Damn it!
Link!
Prince Duraley!
The one who calls is the one who calls himself!
Link!
How dare you talk to the future emperor like that?
You're alive!
Okay, stop!
What?
Are you a masked Envy?
Come on!
Do you want me to list everything we ate for your bill?
I believe you're not a fake!
You're not a fake!
Who did you call a microscopic shrimp?
Exactly you, Ed!
Episode 25, The Gate of Darkness
But really, where did we get?
I remember how he swallowed us and...
Yes, but it can't be that he has such a huge stomach!
It's true, but...
Look here!
This is a piece of hibara that we were in today!
And this is...
The senior lieutenant's car?
And this is probably the flame of the colonel that he swallowed!
Exactly!
It turns out...
Are we really in the stomach of a swallow?
Who knows!
But one thing can be said for sure, we are definitely not in heaven!
Give it to me!
What's there?
Link, look!
Alla's hand?
If there's only a hand here, it means he didn't swallow it!
Thank God!
I'm sure Alla is worried right now!
And we have no idea where we are!
It's time to wake you up, my telepathic abilities!
Telepathic Elricov!
Listen to me, brother!
Please, do it without me!
There are so many buildings and skeletons here!
And all of them from different eras!
I wonder if there's a way out of here?
No idea, but if there's no way out, you just have to do it!
Do it!
And that's it!
It's done!
Put the torch there!
So that's what you were thinking!
I can't hear anything so that it hits the bottom!
The wall! We need to find the wall!
No matter how huge this place is!
If we keep going straight, we will definitely reach the edge!
So we'll find the way out!
She's nowhere to be found!
Where's Xiao Mei?
Maybe she was eaten by a stray dog?
A stray dog?
Hey, I was just kidding! I'm sorry!
You know...
Xiao Mei is actually from a breed of big pandas.
But she was always sick, so she didn't grow at all.
Other pandas gave up on Xiao Mei, and I took care of her.
Since then, we grew up together like sisters.
My clan is one of the weakest, among the 50 clans of Xing.
Maybe that's what it's all about.
It can be said that we got into an unusual trouble.
Yeah, I guess it all started with sympathy.
We grew up together like one family, and we endured hardships together.
No one will replace me with Xiao Mei.
Thanks to her, I was able to transfer so much.
I would never have been able to overcome the desert without her by my side.
Well, let's start with the fact that you shouldn't have gone to the desert at all.
Why would you go to such a despair for the sake of some fairy tale about immortality?
If I don't bring the recipe for immortality, I won't deserve the emperor's favor.
My clan will die.
That's why we crossed the desert together with her.
Together with her.
I beg you, stop screaming!
Master!
We still have time until dawn.
There are not so many soldiers on the streets now.
What?
Will you help me look for her?
He's such a kind person.
His people were exterminated in the Civil War.
Apparently, he sympathizes with you and your weak clan.
What's the matter?
Have you changed your mind to look for her?
No, I'm coming.
It's so hard to walk on my knees in blood.
I'm so tired.
I can't even see the exit.
I want to eat.
If we get out of here, you can eat as much as you can.
Eat as much as you can, sleep as much as you can.
He's getting out.
Link?
I can't take it anymore.
Come on, it's too early to give up.
You're weak.
Are you going to die here?
Get up, come on.
I'll leave you here.
Go away.
You're just a rag.
I'm leaving.
I'm not going to die here.
I'm really leaving.
I'm not kidding.
You said you were leaving.
I'm not going to die here with you.
But they're waiting for you there, too.
Besides, if you have enough strength to talk, then...
If we have a little food...
Do you know what, Link?
The skin product is quite edible.
I guess it's ready.
Here.
You don't have a mushroom from the foot, do you?
Think for yourself, you idiot.
They had a good snack.
I'm sorry.
For what?
For what?
You had to drag me on yourself.
Come on.
It's nothing compared to the training I went through as a child.
It's bad, of course, that we don't know where we are.
But as long as we stick to our feet, we can still find a way out.
And I see you're an optimist.
I'm just very stubborn about survival.
After all, if I give a little weakness, I'll get a total on the first day.
What is it?
Someone's coming.
It's...
Oh, it's you, guys.
It's Envy.
Please tell us where the exit is.
Don't be so humble, Edward Elric.
Back off.
The man will go to everything to survive.
You're pathetic, shut up.
Unfortunately, there is no way out of here.
It's been a long time since I've seen you.
Even I, Envy, was dragged here because of you.
Where are we?
Is this really the stomach of the glutton?
Yes, we're in his stomach, but at the same time we're not.
A solid metal...
I mean, alchemy.
Have you still not figured out where we are?
Well, at the moment when I was pulled into the glutton,
it felt like I knew you.
You remember, don't you?
We've had a fight like this before.
The Gate of Truth.
But this place doesn't look like them at all.
There was white space and a gate.
Oh, so this is what a real gate looks like.
A real one?
And this is the result of a father's unsuccessful attempt to recreate the Gate of Truth.
What?
Even with all its might, the father could not create them.
And this place can be called a crack between reality and truth.
Crack?
No one can get out of here.
We just have to sit here and wait until our lives are over.
Full metal outlets.
Fullmetaloutlets.com
No!
This can't be!
Don't joke with me like that!
Envy!
Hello!
There's no way out.
Are we really going to die here?
No.
We're going to die here.
We're going to die here.
Are we really going to die here?
No.
No.
Wait.
If I die here,
what's going to happen to Al?
I promised him.
I promised that we would bring our bodies back together.
Damn it!
Who the hell is your father who needed to recreate the Gate?
Führer Bradley?
Bradley?
No way!
He's an ordinary homunculus.
I knew it.
The fifth research laboratory.
Human lives.
Philosopher's Stone.
Homunculus.
But if the Führer is a homunculus,
then the war in Ishwar is also in your hands.
Ishwar?
This is the funniest task I've ever received.
Do you know why the uprising broke out?
As far as I remember,
some officer accidentally shot an Ishwar child.
That's right.
It was me, Envy, who killed that child.
You know,
Yuki-san told me about Ishwar.
It was amazing
to watch the civil war
erupt from behind a bullet.
God, I was so happy!
I was so happy!
I was so happy!
I was so happy!
God, I was so happy!
By the way,
then I took the look of an officer
who stood up against the military invasion of Ishwar.
Isn't that funny?
That's why he went to court
and was sentenced to death.
It's so easy to manipulate people.
So it was you.
You killed an innocent child.
Because of you, our city was destroyed.
Because of you, Ishwar and the Ishwari lost their homes.
Because of you, the avenger named Shram appeared.
Because of you,
Inri lost his parents.
Damn it!
What?
He didn't even blink.
Do you want to fight?
Ed, back!
We'll die here anyway.
I'll show you something interesting in the end.
Did you pay attention to his tracks
when we fought in the forest?
No.
Do you want to say?
It's much harder than it seems.
Probably his true form.
Damn it!
What the hell is this?
And why only homunculi
were called artificial people?
I don't know.
What?
What should I do?
I don't know.
What should I do now?
Father!
Father will be angry at me!
Father?
Do you have a father?
Yes.
Did he create homunculi?
Created.
Where is the thing that you swallow?
There must be some trick here.
Think!
Think!
We decided to return our bodies together!
I can't give up!
Swallow!
Take me to your father!
Okay.
You're a valuable victim, aren't you?
Yes, I'm a valuable victim.
But...
What could it mean?
Now only the Elric brothers are finally approved as victims.
What about Dr. Mark?
It's just a matter of time.
What about Kimble?
He doesn't have enough spirit to open the gate.
And what about another one of our candidates as a valuable victim, Mustang-kun?
The Fuhrer is now talking to him in person.
Why did you leave me alive?
It will be enough if you realize your position.
How long ago did the homunculi seize power?
This was thought out even before the formation of this country.
So all this time you were just laughing, watching us.
During the funeral of Major General Hughes, your hands were shaking.
Was it really a game?
There was too much fuss over the death of one soldier.
Wearing a uniform, a person must understand that most likely he will be buried in it.
And this is Hughes' daughter.
I've never heard such a noise at the funeral.
It pissed me off.
You have a child yourself.
How can you say that?
Are you talking about Salimi?
He's a well-bred boy.
I wonder what he would say when he finds out that his father is his son-in-law, the homunculi.
Is this blackmail?
Don't bother yourself.
I definitely can't get close to this edge.
But you're not like me.
Your most vulnerable place is her.
Senior Lieutenant Hawkeye!
What happened?
Today people came to me for work with the cadres.
I... I was transferred to the Southern Staff.
What?
And not just me.
Lieutenant Brad is sent to the Western Staff.
And the Farman family is sent to the North.
Senior Lieutenant Hawkeye!
Yes, sir.
Yakovlev, Department of Work with the Cadres.
Department of Work with the Cadres.
I am the personal adjutant of the Fuhrer, Stork.
Meet me.
Is this an order on translation?
Absolutely correct.
I'll read it.
But this...
What does it mean?
Is this a joke?
Where were you transferred?
Senior Lieutenant Liza Hawkeye.
From tomorrow you are assigned to the Central Staff.
As the personal adjutant of the Fuhrer.
That's how it is.
Colonel Roy Mustang.
Delightful!
Damn, I found something to admire.
That's for sure.
Link!
Ed!
Can you make weapons?
Easily.
There is a sea of blood around us.
It's full of iron.
You have a bad taste.
Come on.
It looks amazing.
Can we do it?
Who knows.
Just look at this machine.
Besides, it just broke a couple of ribs.
Just like me.
But I won't calm down.
For now, as it should be, I won't beat his ass.
Glottony, are you sure this is the right way?
Yes.
But...
Now we are going straight...
Your father is in the capital?

To be continued...
Can the soul become a guiding star in the darkness to the future?
Fight, boy.
If you want to see the truth and know the darkest depths of the darkness.
Next time on Metal Alchemist.
Episode 26.
See you.
I'm not saying goodbye.
Because I believe that we will meet again.
