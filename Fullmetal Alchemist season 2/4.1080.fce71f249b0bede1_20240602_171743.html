        <pre>Alchemy is a science that studies the structure of matter, its disintegration and recreation.
However, it is not omnipotent and does not allow you to create something out of nothing.
In order to get something, it is necessary to replace it with something equal.
This is the principle of equal exchange, the main basis of alchemy.
Transformation of a person is the main taboo of alchemy.
This ban is not allowed to violate anyone.
A solid metal alchemist.

Welcome, come along.
The Principal of Tetanus church made fun of the living man Lior with his philosophical stone and alchemy.
They colluded against the Edel church and destroyed the concept of Huhn.
But the championship stone turned out to be a con.
Stand up and join!
Go ahead. These words of Ed touched the heart of the lost hope of the Rose, but they were also addressed to Ikaal and to him himself.
Episode 4 Pain of the Alchemist
Iron-blooded alchemist Basgram, isn't it?
And who are you?
The alchemist, who turned away from God, must die.
So you're the killer, hunting down many state-owned alchemists?
But...
You're not the one for that!
Take this!
You're fast!
Attack!
Another lover.
Die!
What the...
Die!
Another state-owned alchemist?
What a mess!
Be careful, Major.
You can be his next target.
Yes!
Your Excellency, Fuhrer, why are you here?
I heard the news.
Lieutenant Colonel Hughes, you're in charge of these investigations.
Yes, sir.
If you need someone's help, call these people immediately.
The sword of justice must fall on all rebels.
Yes, sir.
Lieutenant Breda.
Yes.
Damn it, Colonel, I've got so much work to do again.
Hey, Hawak, can you help me with this?
I've got a lot of work to do, you know.
And who is this?
Senior Lieutenant Yoki.
This passer was filling his pockets thanks to the authorities
over the coal mines of Yuswell.
Now he's in trouble, after the Elric brothers exposed his business.
Sergeant Fury, what's up with the radio?
The receiver is closed.
We'll have to replace some parts.
Edward Kuhn, Alfons Kuhn, welcome back.
Welcome back.
Colonel is waiting for you.
Thanks to you, the situation in Liori has improved.
Please accept my gratitude.
We were doing this not for your sake, but for someone else's.
So, the search for the Philosopher's Stone ended with another failure.
The stone turned out to be a fake.
But it had incredible power.
Even a huge chimera was created with its help.
I wonder how you can create something like this using a stone.
I don't know much about bioalchemy, and I can only guess, but...
Yes, I was also interested in it.
If we do such research, maybe we'll find something that can return our bodies.
Yes.
Then why don't you ask a specialist for help?
Huh?
An alchemist who connects life, Schutt and Acker.
He's an expert in the area of ​​chimera transformation.
I'll introduce him to you.
You're doing this for a reason, aren't you?
This is a trap!
Something is definitely hiding behind this!
Don't look at me with such a terrible look!
You've just solved the problem with Leor!
So I don't want to be obliged to you.
Acker became a state alchemist two years ago after he managed to transform chimera,
understanding human speech.
Understanding human speech?
She could speak?
Chimera?
Yes, she could.
Just one phrase.
I want to die.
She refused to eat and soon died.
These are cows!
Paparazzi!
Wow!
We have so many guests!
Nina, I told you to tie the dog.
It's not very convenient.
Since my wife left, this house has been in disorder forever.
Well, it's nice to meet Edward Kohn.
I'm Schutt Acker, an alchemist who connects life.
He is interested in biological transformations.
And he said that for him it will be a great honor to get acquainted with your research.
Well, I don't mind.
However, if you want me to open my cards, you have to open yours.
That's what happens between alchemists.
Why are you interested in biological transformations?
Well, you see, he is a colonel.
Transformation of your mother?
When you were only 11 years old?
I see.
So that's why you were called an all-metal alchemist.
You had to go through a lot.
I don't know if this will help you or not.
But let's take a look at my lab.
Wow!
No, nothing special.
I am considered an authority in the field of alchemy research.
But in fact, I'm not very good at everything.
Oh, awesome!
This is my archive.
Feel like home.
Great!
Then I'll start from this shelf.
In that case, I'll start from there.
I'm waiting for work.
I'll send someone to pick them up in the evening.
What a concentration!
He no longer notices anything around.
So there are still geniuses in the world.
Higher, even higher!
Al, what the hell are you doing?
Well, Nina wanted to play with someone.
Hey, what did we come here for?
Alexander says he wants to play too.
Play means play.
Play means play.
Play means play.
Play means play.
Play means play.
They say that even when hunting a rabbit, the lion does not hold back his strength.
I, Edward Elric, will throw all my physical and spiritual power at you!
You are a damn dog!
Yo, boss, I came to pick you up.
What are you doing?
Well, we just decided to give you a little break.
Did you manage to find something useful?
Well, I'll be glad to see you tomorrow.
Will you come to us again?
Let's play tomorrow too, okay, Nina?
Yeah.
Oh yes, Tucker-san.
I have a message for you from the colonel.
He asked to convey, do not forget, the day of the station is already close.
Yes, I understand.
Well then.
Dad.
What is an attestation?
Well.
Once a year, a state alchemist must report on the results of his research.
Last year, your dad failed to achieve good results.
If dad fails this year, he will no longer be a state alchemist.
What?
Everything will be fine, dad!
After all, you spend so much time on work!
Right, I have to try as best I can.
This is my last chance.
So your mom left you two years ago?
Dad told me that she went to grandma and grandpa.
I see, you should be very lonely to live with dad in such a huge house.
No, everything is fine.
Dad is very good, and I also have Alexander.
But lately, dad is constantly in his laboratory, so I'm a little sad.
I'm a little sad.
Oh, my face is swollen.
Why don't you warm up a little, brother?
Good idea!
Hey, dog!
Will you help me warm up?
You too, Nina!
Wait!
Look!
Don't run away, don't run away!
Wait!
You can do it, Alexander!
Well, don't forget, these stations are already close.
But why is he only hunting state alchemists?
If this army is his goal, he could kill all the soldiers without a doubt.
Killing an alchemist is much more difficult than killing an ordinary person.
And only the best could pass the state registration.
Perhaps this is where the puzzle lies.
Huh?
A huge research foundation and privileges.
Many are envious of this.
In addition, alchemy must serve people.
But after passing the state registration, an alchemist, the one who must seek the truth, becomes a living weapon in the hands of the army.
Moreover, after the civil war in Ishvara, many have hated us.
I report.
Yesterday, at about 9.30 am, I was in the hospital.
I report.
Yesterday, at about 9.30 am, a man with a large scar on his face was noticed by the staff of the central station.
The station?
Did he run away?
It was very difficult for us until I received public testimony.
We lived in poverty.
My wife couldn't stand it and left us.
I have to pass the station at any cost.
I will never come back.
Everything will be fine, dad.
If they say no, we will go with Alexander and give these cones as they should.
Nina is so strong.
Nina, what about us playing together tomorrow?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Alexander, dad said that tomorrow we will all play together.
Good morning, Taker-san.
Today we will use your hospitality again.
Good morning, Taker-san.
Good morning, Taker-san.
Good morning, Taker-san.
Good morning, Taker-san.
Today we will use your hospitality again.
Asya?
Taker-san?
Hey, Nina?
Taker-san?
Oh, so you are here.
Yes.
I finished.
She is perfect.
The world that understands human speech.
Look.
This is Edward, do you understand?
Edward.
That's right.
I am so proud of you.
Amazing.
She is speaking the truth.
Now they will not take my state testimony.
Edward.
Edward.
Edward.
Edward.
Edward.
Baratik.
Taker-san.
Let me remind you when you received the state testimony.
I think about two years ago.
When did your wife leave you?
Two years ago.
Can I ask you one more question?
Nina and Alexander.
Where are they?
I hate smart kids like you.
Baratik.
So that's how it is.
You did it, didn't you?
Two years ago it was your wife.
And now you used your own daughter and dog to create your own family.
Now you used your own daughter and dog to create your own family.
The possibilities of the transformation of animals are not limitless.
But there are no difficulties with humans.
Why are you so angry?
All the progress of mankind is the result of many similar experiments.
Isn't it?
You are also a scientist and you should stop f**king your brains.
Do you really think that this will take you down?
Playing with human life?
Human life?
You said human life?
A solid metal alchemist.
Look at yourself and your younger brother.
Isn't this the result of what you call a game with human life?
Lies!
We are the same.
You and me.
Lies!
No, it's true.
You had the opportunity and we took advantage of it.
Even though you know it's taboo.
You're wrong.
It's me.
Alchemist.
No.
It's me.
It's me.
Brother.
If you don't stop, he'll die.
Dad.
Are you hurt?
Dad.
Are you hurt?
I'm sorry.
We can't help you anymore.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Let's play.
Let's play.
I made it.
Thanks to this, I will become a state alchemist.
A state alchemist, damn it.
What are you talking about?
Let's play.
Damn it.
If there is something called the hand of the devil in this world, then it is.
Devil, huh?
But according to the order, a state alchemist should take lives from people without hesitation.
If we talk about human lives, then there is not such a big difference between us and Taker.
You understood it and still chose this path.
Isn't it so?
A solid metal.
Without a doubt, you will have to face this more than once.
One day you will have to get your hands dirty.
And you are going to suffer every time this happens?
Let me be called an army man or cursed like the devil.
Al and I will return our bodies.
But we are not devils.
And we are not gods.
We are people.
We are just people.
Weak helpless people.
Who could not even save one little girl.
Why doesn't anyone want to understand us?
Nina.
You're a joker, aren't you?
Who are you?
Looks like you're not from the army.
How did you get in?
There should have been armed guards at the entrance.
The alchemist who turned away from God.
The alchemist.
He must die.
Dad.
Dad.
Dad.
You miserable creature.
Having turned into this once, you will never be the same.
Well then, rest in peace.
God.
Two souls are returning to you.
Please let them cling to your feet and grant them peace and calm.
