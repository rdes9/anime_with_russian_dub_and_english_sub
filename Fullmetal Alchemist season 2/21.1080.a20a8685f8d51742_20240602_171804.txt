Idiot!
Believing in the enemy, you lost your will to live?
I'm very sorry, sir.
Always keep cool.
And don't lose your will to live for nothing.
If you're my subordinate, always fight to the end.
Yes, sir.
I'll let you cover your back, but I need complete surrender.
Who would say, colonel?
You're the ones who went to hell.
Shut up!
And why the hell did you put me in the same room with him?
I'm supposed to be in a separate room with good nurses.
You'll have to be patient.
It's much easier for me to keep you two in the same room.
By the way, why haven't they tried to kill us yet?
Why?
Why did you let this fiery bastard go?
He set Lust on fire!
Lust is dead!
It's not too late. Go and finish him off.
Roy Mustang will come in handy.
In handy? But don't tell me you want me to open it.
Don't worry.
My father gave me this job.
I'll be invited to the world you haven't seen yet.
The goal is to become a metal alchemist.
I was lost.
I was traveling.
Under the mouse-colored sky.
A map of change of day.
Many dreams were blurring.
THE END
THE END
What if it breaks apart?
What?
My brother doesn't get any food in that country.
If it rots, when will I come back to him?
Brother Winry!
What do we do, father?
It's just a hypothesis.
But when we tried to transform mom,
we used our blood to give her information about her soul, right?
Yes.
Then they took us both to the other side of the gate and split us apart.
So there's a chance that your mind and mine are intertwined.
What do you mean?
Maybe I'm somehow connected to your body that's there.
Look, for my age, I'm pretty much...
...small.
He admitted it.
He looked at his fear in the face.
So you think you grow up because of Al?
That's nonsense.
It's not nonsense at all.
You don't grow up because you don't drink milk.
Again with your milk?
That's what you thought.
If you think about it, brother, he sleeps a lot.
Maybe he falls asleep because of me?
Drink!
No way!
No!
It's great if that's the case.
No!
Episode 21. The Path of the Fool.
Have you come to visit the colonel?
Havoksan is also wounded, so we decided to visit them.
If it weren't for the colonel, I'm not sure I'd be here right now.
Why are you here, Sergeant Fury?
I'm carrying out Lieutenant T's orders.
I counted the steps from the very entrance to the basement of the third lab
and calculated the approximate distance to those huge gates in the basement.
It is impossible to determine the exact direction,
so I drew a circle with the lab in the center.
The central headquarters?
And the very edge of the circle is captured by the Fuhrer's residence?
Are the homunculi hiding under it?
Could the Fuhrer be connected to the homunculi?
Then why did he have to kill Greed and his people?
But it still looks suspicious.
He destroyed them all without even trying to question them.
You gave us the Fuhrer's task.
In any case, we don't know how many high-ranking officials are involved in the conspiracy,
so we need to count on the worst.
Aim for the metal and be careful.
The Fuhrer and the homunculi.
Looks like the wolf turned out to be bigger than we expected.
Didn't you swing too much?
Otherwise, there would be no point.
It seems that now there will be enough work for you.
Oh, by the way, about that.
Don't count on me anymore.
I don't feel my legs.
Forgive me.
I'm out of the game.
I...
What brought you here?
Radiculite.
The ceiling is on the legs all day, so this is not the most suitable job for the old man.
I immediately guessed about everything as soon as I found out that your job was to burn the body.
What did you think?
Did you know that the case was not clean and you still concluded that it was Lieutenant Ross?
What was expected from a comrade in arms?
We are not comrades in arms.
Rather, co-partners.
You burned them and I prepared them.
Ishvar was one big laboratory for experiments on people.
You made a dangerous game.
How could you not pay once for this?
Already paid.
What happened?
My comrade...
Paralyzed because of the damage to his spinal cord.
Oh, well, I just promised myself to smoke no more than one cigarette a day.
I quit because a woman dumped me.
What a pain.
What do you think you do as a citizen?
My parents have their own store in the province.
I'll be there to answer the phone.
What if I made you an autobahn?
It won't work.
Paralyzed blocks all signals of the nervous system below the belt.
Life in retirement is not for you.
Colonel.
About the knock-out, I got some information from the metal boss.
Dr. Marko.
Specialist in medical alchemy.
Kilosov's Stone.
May I extend your leave?
I allow.
Go.
Oh, Major.
You're back from your vacation.
How was your trip to the east?
Don't tell him by any chance.
It's a strange place where there are no beautiful ladies.
Oh, yes, Major.
I got a paper from the military police.
It contains a notice for all state alchemists.
This is...
Well?
Yeah.
I should have told you that I'm a state alchemist.
They let me in without further questions.
Did you find the entrance to the basement?
It wasn't there.
But I noticed traces of the transformation reaction.
They are not so stupid to leave the entrance open.
I see.
It seems that now we will have to look for a new way to get to the homunculi.
They said they didn't want to kill me because I'm a valuable victim.
She told me the same thing.
I'm a truly valuable victim because I was able to open the gate.
It turns out that these victims should become
the alchemists who were able to open the gate and come back.
But why do they want to make us open the gate?
I'll get the truth out of them.
Edward Kuhn!
Sergeant Brosch?
Thank God I found you.
Hey, what happened?
You have to go back to the hotel immediately.
If you want, I'll call an escort.
Attention to all residents of the city.
The military police department reports that the killer Shram is again spotted in the capital.
There are three new victims.
All state alchemists.
Several people are seriously injured.
According to the testimony of the witness, the criminal has a huge scar on his forehead in the shape of a cross.
He is boiling and his right hand is completely covered with tattoos.
Tattoos on the right hand.
Full metal alchemist.

Shram killed Uncle and Aunt Rock?
I don't know for sure yet.
But then ...
Brother, you can't talk about this to Inri.
Of course not.
I don't want to see her tears anymore.
Me too.
It looks like we'll have to meet Shram again.
To find out the truth from him.
Yes, but there is another reason.
We use it to lure the homunculi.
What?
After all, I need them alive.
Which means if Shram attacks me and I'm in danger ...
They will come out.
Do you understand how unlikely it is?
But it's better than sitting with your hands folded.
Last time Shram managed to handle us in two counts.
Well, I'm sure since then we have become much stronger.
And even if the homunculi appear, how do we catch them?
They are not just strong, they are invincible.
Invincible?
That means ...
Immortal, right?
And again from the window.
We will help you with this.
What?
We are not concerned with problems in your army.
But if we are talking about homunculi or immortality, then it's a completely different matter.
Don't you trust us?
We are grateful that you helped out Lieutenant Ross, but ...
The more people in your country, the better, isn't it?
I'm serious.
But I have responsibility for the fate of the whole clan.
Okay.
But just try to escape with the homunculi.
I will keep my promise.
Moreover, I owe you for food.
For food?
Service in the room?
They feed great in this place.
You ate a lot!
Shut up!
I have to get up early tomorrow because I can't sleep.
Well, yes, you're returning to Russia tomorrow.
Wait, maybe you'll stay in the capital for a little longer.
Asya?
Well, you know, how to say ...
Well, my hand may break.
More precisely, it will probably break again.
Are you going to break it again?
Oh, my brother's soul!
Oh my God!
Just don't do anything too dangerous, okay?
Doctor!
Doctor!
Are you home?
Oh!
Holy shit!
I see.
But anyway, thank you for the job.
Now we're in the dead end.
Once again, I'm sorry to bother you.
Who were they?
My mother is a representative of the Department of Defense Officers.
I filled in the necessary papers.
Not everything is over yet.
Maybe you will be able to be cured.
I'm not so stupid to not understand.
Now I have no ID.
But ...
Who needs a pawn that can't walk?
Who needs a pawn that can't walk?
What's wrong with you?
Leave me behind!
Throw it away!
You don't have time to deal with someone like me!
Have you forgotten the promise given to Major General Hughes?
Lieutenant Hubbard!
I don't need your pity!
Don't make me hope in vain.
Please!
Okay.
I'll leave you.
I'll leave you, so you'll have to catch up with me.
I'll go ahead.
I'll be waiting for you upstairs.
He didn't leave me.
Even when I lost the desire to live.
He trusted me to cover his back again.
He will never leave his comrades.
What a fool!
How is he going to break his way to the top,
being so soft-hearted?
I think it's good that there are still such fools in the world.
I know.
Bring me my uniform.
It's too early for you to go out.
Don't make me repeat myself.
Yes, sir.
Just look at what you've done!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Just look at what you've done!
I'm sorry.
How do I work now, huh?
Looks like you have a problem, guys.
State alchemist Edward Elric is in a hurry for help.
Unbelievable!
Thank you very much.
How can I repay you?
Repay?
Well, I don't take payments.
I broke my favorite vase.
Can you fix it?
Just a minute.
Edward Elric-kun!
Your state alchemist Edward Elric is always glad to help.
This one too.
Please fix it.
Now the whole city only talks about me.
You would have made such a noise.
I didn't expect this from you.
Colonel!
Have you already been discharged from the hospital?
Well, as you can see.
I heard about Lieutenant Hawke.
Dr. Mark could ...
Quiet!
They can hear us here.
Get in.
It's better to get out.
Marko-san is gone?
They must have kidnapped him.
By the way, it's all metal.
Have you heard about Sharami?
So what the hell are you doing here?
Do you want to attract his attention?
I want him to find me.
I have to fight him again.
Don't be a fool.
Did you forget what he did to you in the eastern city?
Oh, and we are so afraid of Sharami.
Well, of course.
Last time there was no point from our colonel.
Don't be a fool.
The weather is great today.
Oh, and in addition, you barely hold on to your feet.
You are absolutely useless.
Shut up!
Lay down on the ground.
What is it?
It's not raining, and you're all wet.
Wait, Lieutenant.
Don't shoot.
Why?
I was thinking,
wouldn't he let me kill the colonel?
We are going to lure the homunculi out,
using our brother as bait.
He's a valuable victim.
They can't let him die.
That's nonsense.
We don't want any more victims.
So either I or my brother will have to become a bait.
What if Sharami shoots the military before the homunculi appears?
You won't refuse to help us with that, will you, Colonel?
You decided to use me for your own purposes?
Don't be so impudent.
If you catch the homunculi, don't forget to share it with me.
Okay, guys.
The reserve apartment of Sergeant Fury is very close.
Let's go.
Yes, sir.
Here we go.
You two!
Step aside!
Don't shoot!
You'll hurt your brother!
Damn it!
If Sharami shoots, everything will be lost!
I can't help but let him go,
or come too close.
When will you show up, homunculi?
What's the frequency of the military police?
Oh, I found it.
I didn't expect less from Fury.
Report, third section of the military police.
We have entered the fight with Sharami.
We are ready.
What are you doing?
Okay, now the 17th section.
The further, the merrier.
He says...
What the hell is going on here?
Is Sharami on the 17th section, too?
What about the 3rd section?
Colonel Douglas!
He showed up on the 8th section, too.
What?
The military police is in control of the 8th section.
Sharami is fighting a boy.
He's a state alchemist.
He's a great man.
He's a great man.
He's a great man.
He's a state alchemist.
Don't shoot.
Someone's spreading false information.
The 4th section?
What the hell?
He says the 3rd section is clear.
He says the 8th section is found.
Send reinforcements immediately.
Swallow.
I can smell it.
I can smell it.
The smell of Shvarit.
I feel something.
Are you Erenfan?
Yes.
Great. Let's start.
What will it be?
Destruction of flesh or car armor?
Brother.
Lucky.
He has generated the destructive energy.
How stupid.
Tattoos on the right hand?
Asshole.
It was you.
I can smell it.
I can smell it.
Salam aleikum.
You have such a strange ki.
How many souls do you have?
Who?
Don't even try to run away.
I'm your vile ki.
I'll knock you down.
Enemy?
You can be eaten.
You knew it.
Gamuncul.
So you can feel us.
Disappointing skill.
But I'll get rid of it.
Erenfan.
Run.
Erenfan.

Far away silhouettes.
I want to protect her.
That's all the boy could think of at that moment.
