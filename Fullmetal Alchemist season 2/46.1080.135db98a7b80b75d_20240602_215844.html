That day is near.
People continue to prepare for the battle in which their fate will be decided.
In the meantime, spring has come in Amestris.
And that day will come with it.
Episode 46. Shadow of the Hunter
You have a holiday today.
This is the Risenburg Spring Festival of Oats.
Can you do me one favor?
We need to replenish water supplies.
Of course. Take as much as you need.
Guys, take out the cisterns.
One.
Devi.
One.
Devi.
It seems that there is no one at home.
We arrived, sister.
Let's go.
Here I am at home.
Oh, look how much armor.
Please do not touch anything.
Everything is overgrown with dust.
What happened?
Edward Elric?
Who are you?
Ouch!
What are you doing here?
Link?
You are a friend of Kimli.
Are you from Briggs?
Have you been following us all this time?
Quiet, quiet, quiet.
Lower the cannons.
Tell me, Kat, what's going on here?
This is a long story.
And by the way, what were you doing in my room?
It's just that such a beautiful view opens from here.
I'm telling you, lower the cannons.
You are the first.
Shut the hell up.
Get out of my room.
Get out of my room.
I was worried about you.
Well, I'm glad you're okay too.
Isn't Al with you?
Al is now at the station.
Guys, he's left with Miles and San.
They're leaving soon.
But if you hurry, you'll be in time.
Something's wrong.
You're not going to him?
We're being searched by the whole central army.
We can't let anyone see us.
But...
The spring festival is coming.
It brings back memories.
We're leaving.
Got it?
I hope the next time you come back to this city,
you'll be in your real body.
Thank you.
Winry?
Welcome back.
Thank you.
Sorry for making you worry.
It seems I've got a lot of money in the house.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Link, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
You're not a buddy anymore?
I'm sorry for bothering you.
We're Rik's soldiers,
and Winry's bodyguard.
Link, you've changed.
You know him too?
I'm Grid.
Nice to meet you.
So now these three are working on me.
But why are you here?
I have to be sure that his car armor is ready for all.
Well, I wanted to make it perfect.
It's better for you to do it, Winry.
You made all the last changes yourself, and I can't tune it perfectly.
Yes, of course.
So, Leor is starting to revive.
Thank God.
I was worried about how they were.
So, why did Al stay with Major Miles?
I heard that in Brixie something is being set up for joint training with the East.
Al decided to stay with them in case he needed his help.
I see.
Your father has already gone to the capital.
Now he is in the town of Kanama.
You have to meet him and listen to him.
You already know about that day.
Yes, Greta told me.
This day is our chance to return our bodies.
And that day Amestris will be able to disappear from the face of the Earth.
You know...
What?
Take Grandma with Dan and leave the country.
You want me to run away?
Have you already given up?
Our country is rolling to hell, and you can't stop it?
I can!
But you can't exclude the chance!
There is no chance and forget about it!
After all, they are going to do something terrible!
You have to stop them and protect our country!
And you, Salam, have to return your old bodies!
And I will do everything to help you!
You can think it's so easy.
What is it?
Didn't you give up before?
Hey, wait, Ed!
That's it, enough with the girl's whining!
Ed!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
You have a nice girlfriend.
She wants both this and that, and that's it.
If you are too greedy, you can go hungry.
See?
I wanted to resurrect a man, and that's what I ended up with.
I want to see my dead friends again.
I want money.
I want women.
I want to save the world.
All these wishes.
They were born with one feeling.
And when it comes to greed, you can't separate the bad from the good.
How can you try to classify greed on the part of people?
I don't understand you.
Are you leaving at such an hour?
At such an hour?
Nisgoi always dissolves in the dark.
Thank you for setting up the car armor.
If you meet Koenheim, don't forget to tell him the words of Trisha.
Yes, yes.
Ed, I ...
The main thing is not to stick out.
I'll be back as soon as I'm done with all this shit.
I hope I'll be waiting for a hot apple pie.
Of course.
God, what a day.
It's nothing we're doing right now.
That day is already over.
What else can we do?
Marco-san and Shram are still not back.
Damn it, where are they?
Doc!
Where are you guys?
What the hell are you?
We've been waiting for you forever.
I'm sorry.
Let's go to the capital immediately.
It's not often you'll see something like this.
Former military soldiers work together for the sake of one goal.
Exactly.
After all, Amestris is our homeland, and our loved ones live here.
But the other thing is that Shram, who rose against Amestris, is now trying to save him.
Let's clarify something.
I'm not here to save Amestris, but to change him.
This country denies our existence.
I want to make it recognize the people of Ishvara again.
To change the world, you must first change yourself.
Amestris, isn't that right?
Ishvarites?
How?
All these months we wandered the mountains not to admire the nature.
They are my comrades, and we have one goal.
It's my honor to work with you again, General.
It's good that you came to us this time.
It's too cold in the north for an old man like me.
Everything is ready.
We too.
Unfortunately, one tiny problem has arisen.
What?
Little Bradley came to us on an excursion.
Considering the proximity of that day, we assumed that in the capital they would want to observe the teachings.
We need to come up with something.
It started again.
My soul is breaking more and more often.
I need to die if I don't return my body soon.
I can feel it!
I can feel it!
Brother, aim for the metal alchemist!
Do you think you can run away?
Bad news!
I can't fight in such a state!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
What is it?
No, not now!
Not now!
I'll make sure you don't do anything silly until that day.
Alfon Selric.
Full metal alchemist.

Hello.
How are you, Lieutenant General?
I hope you don't mind if I offer you a cup of tea.
Perhaps I'll be able to treat you to lunch soon.
It's hard to trust a new tradition.
The well-being of the Armstrong's never ceases to amaze me.
To say that this mansion is huge is nothing to say.
I think there could be a company here, or a whole battalion.
If something happens to me, you can take it and put it in yourself.
It won't fit in my coffin anyway.
Don't leave it to your brother.
If you choose between the two of you, you look more preferable.
Let her get her hair done.
It's an honor for me.
A late gift.
In honor of your entry into the family mansion.
Hyacinths.
Selim Bradley, homunculus.
Homunculus.
Do you know what hyacinths mean in the language of flowers?
No.
Sturdy beauty and elegance.
I don't need your stinky crickets.
Please excuse me, General.
Boy.
A day before that day.
I won't come out anymore.
I won't come out anymore.
Let's just send all the cannons to Bradley's tower and end this.
Please be quiet.
Major Miles.
So we didn't manage to find Alfonso Elric.
Yes, we're still looking for him, but...
Maybe he was caught?
What a bad time.
Your Excellency.
General Hakura is here.
Your Excellency.
I have something important to tell you about Colonel General Groom's activities.
Is he planning to use the Eastern Army to start a coup?
If so, I'm ready for it.
No, sir, the joint training of the North and the East is just a bait.
During your absence, numerous groups of Shuvart terrorists plan to attack the capital.
Groom wants to use the terrorist threat as an excuse to bring the troops to the capital.
Colonel Mustang will use this trick to seize power.
Everything he said is true.
There are reports of a large number of Shuvart refugees who are coming to the capital.
I'm going back to the capital.
You'll stay here for the rest of your life.
Yes, sir.
I'm going back to the capital.
I'm going back to the capital.
I'm going back to the capital.
You'll stay here for the rest of your life.
Yes, sir.
Damn Mustang, that's what you thought, huh?
I thought we took him out of the game when we transferred all his subordinates.
The train has stopped.
What's going on?
Sheep?
What an untouched village!
Hey, what's going on? They hooked up the wagons!
What?
What the hell?
Tell them to stop!
Ha!
They sent the sheep from the bridge to Boinyu.
We're moving out to the capital, as planned.
We're moving out!
The colonel is waiting for us!
That's right!
What the hell?
You played them into General Hakura's hands!
The Fuhrer's train has just been blown up!
What?
Tomorrow everything will be decided.
It's time to make our move.
Lieutenant Breda, Sergeant Fury.
No more calls.
Now we're all deserters.
Oh, my bright future is crying.
When we're done, we'll get rid of everything on the colonel.
The sequel follows.

I know! This is my chance!
Who would have thought that he would appear at such a moment!
Calm down, friends!
I'm still in the capital!
Who is hiding in the dark? Demons, beasts, monsters?
When their lives will be hanging on the hair, the black ghost of the wind will come to them for help!
Next, in the goal on the metal alchemist, episode 47, the hunter of emptiness!
The light that leads the hearts of people is the light of darkness!
The hunter of emptiness!
The light that leads the hearts of people is the light of darkness!
