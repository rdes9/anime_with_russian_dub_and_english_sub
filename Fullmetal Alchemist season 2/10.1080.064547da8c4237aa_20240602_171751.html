        <pre>The strength of one man is the limit.
But I will protect everyone I can.
Let it be only a handful of people, the most precious to me.
And they will protect those who are dear to them.
Is a small person capable of this?
Geometric progression?
This means ...
If you want to protect the whole country,
then you have to be at the very top of the pyramid.
That would be nice, Hughes.
But I can't go all the way alone.
Now I understand it.
So you've already thought it through?
Sounds interesting.
I'm in the business too.
I want to see how your childhood ideals will change this country.
Colonel!
Colonel!
If you were tired, you could go to the rest room.
Oh, sorry.
I wanted to finish all the work before moving to the capital.
I haven't slept much lately.
It looks like you had a dream.
What?
Yes, another annoying memory.

And now go and deal with this when the fifth laboratory turned into a pile of stones.
It seems that they are discussing something serious there.
And I don't want to listen, I don't want to be dragged into some kind of adventure again.
Excuse me, is this the room of a solid metal chemist?
Yes, it is.
Here he is.
Perhaps if we dig into the materials of the military tribunal, we will be able to find out something.
And I will conduct an investigation among the subordinates of Dr. Mark, who participated in the creation of the stone.
I'm sorry to bother you.
The Fuhrer King Bradley!
Well, well, be quiet, you can relax.
Your Excellency, allow me to find out why you are here.
Well, to visit the wounded.
You like melon, don't you?
Yes, thank you.
Is this normal at all?
It seems that you have started a major investigation among the leaders of the army, Major Armstrong.
What? That is, I ...
Well, how are you?
Do not underestimate my counterintelligence.
Listen, Edward L. Rickon,
to the Philosopher's Stone, isn't it?
What do you already know, depending on this?
I'm kidding.
Do not strain yourself so much.
What?
I also know about the underground that is active in the army.
I wanted to do something for a long time, but ...
Oh, it's ...
List of people who have been doing research on the Philosopher's Stone, right?
All of them are counted without leading the missing.
What?
And their disappearance was reported a few days before the destruction of the fifth laboratory.
The enemy is constantly one step ahead of us.
Even my counterintelligence has not yet been able to find out the scale of their plan, their goal,
and how close they are to its achievements.
In other words, it will be extremely dangerous to continue the investigation.
Exactly.
Lieutenant Colonel Hughes, Major Armstrong,
brothers L. Ricky,
now I know that you can be trusted.
I forbid you to continue this investigation and report it to strangers.
Now, when we cannot confidently say who is a friend and who is an enemy,
no one can be trusted.
From this point on, consider that each military is your enemy and act carefully.
However ...
When the time comes, I will count on each of you, so get ready.
Exactly!
Your Excellency!
Your Excellency, where are you?
Oh, damn it!
These bastards are already here.
As you can see, I ran away from work.
Good luck!
Hey, Ed!
What?
What happened to you?
Well, let's just say that the storm just passed.
I bought a ticket, as you asked.
For tomorrow's morning train, right?
Yeah, thanks.
Why are you in such a hurry?
After all, your wounds have not healed yet.
Can't I sit forever in this missing medicine in the middler?
Where are you going this time?
To the doblis.
Yes!
We ourselves are well-known and decided to visit our sensei.
I'm scared, brother!
We will surely be killed!
Hold on, brother!
I'm as scared as you are!
What kind of person is your sensei?
Doblis is quite far from here.
Where is he?
Well, let's see.
Here he is!
In the very center of the southern region.
What is it?
This city is next to the doblis.
This is the land inhabited by the mechons of Rushwell.
I've been dreaming of going there all my life.
Take me, take me, take me, take me,
and you will be better off.
Go there yourself.
Who will pay for the trip then?
So you want to make me pay for this?
Why not?
We don't care about the way.
Damn you!
Hurray!
I'll go call grandpa.
Yes, she will be gorgeous, Jinva.
I don't want to listen to this.
Of course, not as gorgeous as mine.
Well, it's time for daddy.
Will you come home earlier today, daddy?
I don't know, I don't know.
Daddy has a lot of work.
But I'll be back as soon as I finish.
You're so late.
You're leaving today, aren't you, Winry?
I won't be able to see you off because of work, so take care of yourself.
Thank you for everything.
Really, thank you.
Don't forget to visit us when you're in the capital next time.
Take this place as your home.
And say hello to the boy.
Okay.
Good luck, daddy.
Have a nice trip.
Why did you suddenly decide to visit your sensei?
There are two reasons.
First, we've been losing shape lately.
What? You're going there to get even stronger?
Do you have muscles instead of brains?
Stupid, it's not that simple.
We want you to get stronger not only in our business, but also in your spirit.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I don't know what you're talking about.
We want you to get stronger not only in our business, but also in your spirit.
Right?
Yes.
I'm sure if we meet the teacher, we'll get stronger.
I want to get much stronger than now.
And the second reason?
Ask her about the Philosopher's Stone.
The truth is hidden behind the truth.
We haven't been able to explain the meaning of these words.
Sensei, I'm sure there's something about it.
Whatever it is.
Even if it's the right death, we'll ask the sensei.
We'll ask.
We'll ask.
Life was so short.
I didn't even have time to get a girlfriend.
What kind of person is your sensei?
A rebellion in Leora?
Yes.
Obviously, the reason was a cult of the god of summer, a deceiving citizen.
But everything has calmed down.
I see.
Add other rebels here.
How is everything launched in the east?
Not only the east.
Rebels and border warriors are exploding in the north and west.
And there are whole mountains of corpses everywhere, huh?
So it's not long before the coup.
Where are you going, colonel?
To the library.
Rebellion in Leora.
People as material for the Philosopher's Stone.
A massacre in Ishvara.
Oh my, who's behind all this?
I can't believe I'm thinking about this.
We need to tell the Fuehrer about everything.
Nice to meet you, Lieutenant Colonel Hughes.
Or should I say goodbye?
Full metal outlandish.
Full metal outlandish.
Fullmetal outlandish.
You have a great tattoo there.
You've learned too much, Lieutenant Colonel Hughes.
Dammit!
Dammit!
I was supposed to say that.
Oh, Lieutenant Colonel Hughes,
if you're here to talk about family affairs again,
Lieutenant Colonel Hughes, do you have blood?
Chebukha, I have to make a call.
I need to call the Fuehrer.
The Fuehrer.
I'm sorry to bother you.
Lieutenant Colonel!
Hello, this is the Eastern Headquarters.
Connect me to Roy.
Lieutenant Colonel Roy Mustang.
I'm sorry, we're not allowed to make calls on the open line.
I'm Lieutenant Colonel Hughes from the capital.
This is an emergency, I'm calling from the phone booth.
Please, give me the password.
What a strain!
Uncle Sugar Olive 8-0-0!
Password confirmed.
Please wait.
Hurry!
The army is in danger!
Lieutenant Colonel, could you please put the phone down?
The phone, please.
Lieutenant Ross, or not?
Who are you?
I'm Lieutenant Maria Ross.
Have you forgotten?
No, you're a self-proclaimed.
Lieutenant Ross has a relative under his left eye.
Really?
How insolent!
So?
What the hell?
Some kind of incitement.
Your intelligence has ruined you, Lieutenant Colonel Hughes.
Hey, hold the horses.
My wife and daughter are waiting for me at home.
Damn it!
I'm going to die here!
It's a flawless copy, isn't it?
Damn you!
Lieutenant Colonel Hughes on the open line.
Again?
Connect.
On the wire.
If you talk about your daughter again, I'll hang up.
Hughes?
Hughes!
Hey, Hughes!
People are so stupid.
Give up your life for such nonsense.
Alicia.
Gracie.
I'm sorry.
I don't seem to be able to keep my promise.
Wow, delicious!
This apple pie is just something!
Gracie is a great cook.
I know.
The dinner she once fed us was excellent.
It's on my list of dishes I eat when I get my body back.
She taught me how to cook it.
So when you get your body back, I'll bake a pie especially for you.
Hooray!
Hughes and Gracie were wonderful people.
Lieutenant Colonel Hughes is a man of his word.
He always gets in the way.
He always made fun of you when he came to the hospital.
To tell you the truth.
Despite the fact that he's always busy at work,
he found the time to visit me every day.
I need to thank him for the next visit.
Uh-huh.
Mom.
Why don't you bury Dad?
Alicia.
If you don't bury him, Dad won't be able to go to work.
Alicia.
Dad said he had a lot of work to do.
Stop it!
Don't bury him!
Alicia.
Dad said he had a lot of work to do.
Stop it!
Dad!
A double promotion for the death penalty.
General-Major Hughes, right?
You promised to provide me with support from below.
And now you're older than me by rank.
Fool.
Colonel.
Aren't alchemists disgusting, Lieutenant?
Now I'm desperately trying to find a way to make a human transformation.
It seems now I know what these boys were feeling.
Trying to resurrect their mother.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
It looks like it's going to rain.
No.
The sky is clear.
No.
It's definitely going to rain.
You're right.
It's time to go.
Or we'll catch a cold.
When I left the room, he said he was going to the library.
Who's going to the library?
That was the last time I saw Lieutenant Colonel.
Did he have a fight with someone?
Most likely.
There are traces of blood from the room along the entire corridor.
And then he went...
Colonel tried to call, despite his wounds.
But suddenly...
He left with the phone.
I found something in the archives of the tribunal that forced him to contact me on the city line,
not the tribunal building.
The operator of the eastern headquarters heard how he said the army was in danger.
What does that mean?
What was he trying to tell me?
Colonel.
I brought Major Armstrong.
We have a guess about the killer Lieutenant Colonel Hughes.
Then why aren't they under surveillance?
It's just a guess. We don't know exactly who they are.
What do you mean? I need details.
I can't.
As a colonel, I order you to speak.
Or do you refuse to obey the order of the senior officer?
I have no right.
I see. I'm sorry I called you here.
You may go.
Yes, sir.
Colonel, I forgot to tell you.
The Elric brothers were here and left just a couple of days ago.
The Elric brothers?
Yes, the Elric brothers.
Did they find what they were looking for?
No.
What they were looking for is practically a legend.
I see. Thank you.
We were able to find out a little about him, weren't we?
In fact, the Major is just a friend.
He specifically said the killer Lieutenant Colonel Hughes.
That means there are several of them.
And perhaps they are part of a certain organization.
He couldn't speak even at the order of the colonel.
That means he was forced to be silenced by someone higher than me by name.
It seems that the top of the army is involved in this.
And the thing that the Elric brothers are looking for.
In other words, the Philosopher's Stone.
The organization that took over the higher military officials.
The Philosopher's Stone.
And Lieutenant Colonel Hughes, what kind of connection is there?
Now we don't know.
But as soon as I get to the capital, I'll take these greedy bastards to the water and find the killer Hughes.
It doesn't look like you.
Mixing personal and professional goals.
There are no more such concepts.
Become a Fuhrer and avenge Hughes.
This is my single aspiration and my goal.
I'm going to climb to the top. Are you with me?
Are you still asking?
The End
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry

I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
The goal is the metal alchemist.
Episode 11.
A miracle in Rushwell.
Words cut out for them are words of determination.
Or maybe they are...
