        <pre>To erase this feeling, life is still long, isn't it?
I want to try to do what I left behind
A solid metal alchemist
I should have been chasing the continuation of my dream
I'm going down a narrow road
I don't want to go back to the way I was
I'm looking for the sky that I lost
I don't want to see a sad face like a sacrifice
The end of sin is not tears
I'll carry it painfully
Who are you waiting for?
I want to spit it out more honestly
I want to escape from something
I want to shout that I'm alive to make reality come true
Can you hear me?
I can't do that
There is no place to go back
I'm grateful for kindness
So I want to be strong
It makes me nostalgic
This pain has nothing to do with it
This is Roy Mustang
A fiery alchemist, isn't it?
It's interesting to break through so high at his age
How many strings did he pull?
The higher you fly, the more painful it is to fall
Come in
Excuse me
I'm Colonel Roy Mustang
Ah, Colonel Mustang
I'm very sorry, but his Excellency Fuhrer is missing
Where is he?
He went to the southern district with a check
The southern district?
I don't like this smell
It's painful, but he's familiar
It's...
I came here with a routine check, but it looks like I found something interesting
Let's start the fun
Let's go
Let's go
Let's go
Let's go
Let's go
Let's go
Let's start the fun
Episode 14
The one who hides underground
It's not bad for a housewife and child
But you're not the most suitable opponent for sparring
Let me lean back
Bastard
Sir, hold on
He's running away
Pity coward
Sensei
Sensei, Sensei
Be a good boy
No, I don't want to
Oh
Great Sun
Martell, I see you're safe
What's going on here?
Oh, the others haven't come back yet
Yeah, it looks like we're stuck
We need to figure out how to get out of here
You won't make it
Who are you, old man?
Fuhrer, how did you get here?
King Bradley?
Wow
What could a most important person in this country need in this clack?
How old are you, puppy?
What?
I'll turn 60 this year
And I'm not as smart as I was when I was young
I want to finish everything here quickly and go home
So why don't you just retire, old man?
What?
Hey, hey, hey, what are you doing, old man?
Gritsen
Gritsen
Look at this
This art of sculpture was passed down from generation to generation in the Armstrong dynasty
Let me show you my true power
What the hell is this?
Guys, home owners are safe
All that's left is to destroy these monsters
As Fuhrer ordered
What?
It's been a long time since I've had such a pleasure from a fight
What was expected from you, Armstrong Dano?
I also participated in the destruction of Ishvara
Old comrade
Then, moreover, I do not like senseless murders
Surrender
So that you can kill me calmly
Major
Low
Low
Oh, you bastard
I have no absolute shield like you have no blade capable of cutting everything on its own
But how did I manage to survive so many battles, get under the hail of shells and climb to the very top?
You already understood
You, you
As you have an absolute shield
I have an absolute eye
Well, Gritkun
How many times do I have to kill you before you die?
Where is Gritsin?
I do not know
It's too dark here, I do not see anything
Gritsin
Gritsin
Gritsin
Gritsin
Gritsin
Gritsin
Gritsin
Gritsin
No
Open
No
Let me out
No
Damn!
Führer of your own person!
You can run away by pressing your tail, there will be nothing to be ashamed of.
I would be happy, but the dogs are too loyal creatures.
Get her out of here.
We're counting on you.
Lou!
Dorset!
Hey, open up!
Let me out!
No!
There's no time to argue!
I told you to open up!
No, you can't get out!
Just let me out!
Do you really want me to just watch my comrades being killed?
I can't let you out!
They asked me to protect you!
Dorset!
I'm begging you!
You can't get out!
Hey, Bradley-san!
What are you going to pay for my subordinates?
Do you feel sorry for your six?
How stupid!
Do I feel sorry for them?
Are you out of your mind?
Who do you think I am?
I'm the Führer of my own person!
Who are you?
I'm the Grit-Sama!
Money, women, servants!
All of this has to be mine!
And I won't give my own to anyone!
I'm the very greed!
Greed?
You're even more stupid than I thought!
Take a break while you're here!
We need to run!
Wait!
You're Edward Kuhn's younger brother, aren't you?
Are you hurt?
Do you need help?
Yeah, no, I'm fine!
I can walk home on my own!
No!
Martell himself is dead!
No!
Martell himself is dead!

No!
Martell himself is dead!
Bradley!
Ouch!
No!
Martell himself is dead!
Martell himself is dead!
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
Al!
Hey, wake up!
Hey, say something!
Al!
Brother!
Are you okay?
Brother, you're covered in blood!
We had to open and pull her out ourselves!
I couldn't save her!
It's not your fault, Al!
Come on, let's go home!
Al!
Don't rush!
Come on!
Come on!
Don't rush!
I have a few questions for you.
Is the leader of this gang, Greed, your friend?
No.
Did you find out anything important about him?
Nothing that would be useful to the army.
You don't understand.
I'm not going to ask you to help the army now.
If you've been doing business with him,
it depends on your answer.
So, do you have a connection with the people who came up with the conspiracy against the government?
No.
I have more questions.
This hand is made of steel and the body is your brother's.
They are somehow connected.
Are you honest, little one?
Let's get out of here.
Take care of your brother.
Thank you for taking care of the Hellrich brothers.
Come on!
Protecting the lives of state alchemists is one of the military duties.
By the way, didn't you want to be under the protection of the army?
The quality of state alchemists?
Absolutely right.
As you can see, I'm just a housewife.
Has this country come to the point where it needs help from someone like me?
What cruel words!
Well, I'll be back.
Maybe by that time my heart will give you another answer.
This guy, Greed, had a Uroboros tattoo on his hand.
Uroboros?
Do you remember our conversation with Lieutenant Colonel Hughes?
These people are somehow connected to the creation of the Philosopher's Stone.
Hughes is right.
Edward Hellrich.
Please be careful.
Okay.
That's good.
Brother.
Memories of how they took my body came back to me.
How did it happen?
Well, it was something like that.
But I didn't find out anything about the human transformation.
I see.
We didn't find out anything.
That's not true.
Do you remember what the Fuhrer said about the underground in the army?
Yes, he said that we need to deal with the Philosopher's Stone and the people with Uroboros tattoos.
And that he wants to catch them, right?
Greed also has this tattoo.
But why was it necessary to kill everyone here?
If he really wanted to figure it out, it was necessary to take the prisoners and interrogate them, wasn't it?
Really?
And the fact that the Fuhrer personally participated in such an insignificant operation of the country on his own?
Yes, something is not clear here.
It seems that we will have to work with the army longer than I thought.
Welcome back, my Fuhrer.
How did the routine check in the south go?
The younger brother is aiming for a metal alchemist, and most likely their teacher can also serve as a victim.
And I was also waiting for an unexpected find there.
How many years, how many winters?
He left this place 100 years ago.
Wake up, Greed.
Oh, come on, everyone seems to be together.
Well, you have an absolute shield.
And you are still the same beauty.
The absolute blade, Lost Sun.
And you didn't lose any weight, Glotani.
And this is Envy.
Didn't you have a sense of strength?
And where is Sloth?
He is still so lazy.
He will never finish his job.
A hundred years have passed, and none of you have changed a bit.
But who is this?
I'm Raz.
Raz, you say?
Aren't you King Bradley?
Yes.
He created us a new brother who gives himself up for a man named King Bradley.
An aging homunculus? Is it really possible?
There is nothing impossible.
Aren't these your favorite words?
Just don't tell me you forgot.
Or is it old-fashioned?
Shut your mouth, you bastard.
Oh, I like this look.
No, I like it. It's a whole other thing.
Come on, show me your true form.
Envy is blinded by garbage.
Oh, you bitch.
Since you ask so much, I'll kick your ass.
Stop it, you both.
Didn't you stop taking the opportunity to cause a fight in the presence of your father?
Oh, Glotani.
I see you've aged a lot since our last meeting.
Greed.
My son, with whom I shared my soul.
Why did you betray me?
Why?
Who the hell doesn't know that?
You gave me the name Greed.
You gave me life and with it the only way I could go.
If I stayed with you, I would never have quenched my thirst.
Are you ready to serve me again?
Never.
That's how.
Well, you have a weird taste.
Hey, the temperature is just right, damn it.
I keep steam in the water, it will be hotter.
I will wait for you there with impatience, relatives.
Come back to where you were born.
To my soul, Greed.
With pleasure.
Don't be offended by me if the animal is taken by the botanist.
For the coming day, for your unwavering loyalty and devotion.
Daddy!
Welcome back, daddy!
Thank you, Selim.
How was the trip?
It was a routine check, but everything is fine.
Darling, you are not getting any younger.
Why don't you tell the country to the young and not go to rest?
No, no, I will still serve.
By the way, in the south I met a whole-metal alchemist.
A tiny alchemist?
Really?
You love the story about Edward Sand so much, Selim.
Of course, he is the youngest state alchemist, it's so great.
Exactly, I also want to learn alchemy.
Why do you want to learn it?
To become a state alchemist and help daddy.
In this case, I count on you, Selim.
