        <pre>White scenery is inviting me now
I'm going to the world I haven't seen yet
All-metal alchemist
I was lost
Under the sky of the mouse
A map of the day
Many dreams were blurred
Someday
Even if I'm small
I wonder if I can go to the other side of that cloud
Strong and wounded
As if my heart had been pierced
The raindrops that fell
Repetitively
A straight light intersects
As I tell you where to go
I'll go through anywhere
I'll keep burning blue
No matter where I am under this sky
I'm going to the world I haven't seen yet
I'm going to the world I haven't seen yet
Oh, it's so boring!
And they've been watching us all the time!
Renfan and Fusan?
Hey!
Where is the young gentleman?
I haven't seen him!
Has he disappeared again?
No, it's true, it was worth turning back for a moment
Young gentleman!
Where are you?
I hope he didn't fall into the abyss again
The road is a mess
Let's go
Yes?
Young gentleman, where are you?
Something is wrong with this country
Episode 16, by the footsteps of a comrade
It's me, I came to visit
Well done
From the colonel
Oh, hello, cigarette
Well, how was the success?
I won at least once
Two times in a row
How boring the game is!
Hey, at least at night
Can I steal people, huh?
No
Well, at least give a lady a hug and bring it, huh?
Yeah, I'll definitely remind her
And how long do I have to watch for this guy?
What does the colonel say?
I'm sorry I gave you such a dangerous task
And don't worry about your official duties
I sent you to the hospital
But you will get sick with me deadly
If anyone of the civilians or military finds us
That's what he said
Good news
Is there?
Yes, what?
I have a girlfriend
She helped me so much when I completely screwed up with this crossing
She is so cute
Hey, how do you think it would be nice to crush her?
Well, get out of here
Oh my God, what's wrong with him?
What's wrong with him?
Hey, how are you?
Food
Hey, are you hungry?
Where is he from?
What, from Shingo?
Far away
By the way, do you have a business visa?
Road, road, we are bringing a guest worker
Young master, where are you?
He fell into the abyss again, I know for sure
Well, first let's take a look at the headquarters
Let's go
Then I'll first visit Yuzo
I can't wait to meet Gracie and Lisa
Okay, see you later
See you later
I'm worried if Lieutenant Colonel Hughes could find out anything else about me
Considering that the FÃ¼hrer forbade him from getting involved
We need to tell him about everything we found out
Homunculi
Yes
Lieutenant Colonel should be on duty now
Let's go
Shesuka? Shesuka?
Yes
Do you have the key to this office?
Yes
I do
Oh, it's from the third office
I made a mess there
Don't worry, I just need to take the papers
It's just a terrible mess there
I'm going to clean up now, give me a minute
Okay
I'll come in when you're done cleaning
Yes, mom
Lieutenant Colonel?
Lieutenant Colonel Mustang?
How long did I sleep?
About 10 minutes
The meeting is about to start
Okay, I'm going to go
Bye
Bye
Bye
Bye
I'm sorry to interrupt, but you need to take a little break
and rest
Okay, I'll be back soon
Was that Lieutenant Colonel Mustang?
Good morning, Captain Fokker
Good morning, Shesuka
What did the Lieutenant Colonel do here?
Well, you see...
Is the archive open?
I'm sorry, to tell you the truth...
Let me guess, he made you let him in, didn't he?
I won't tell anyone
Thank you so much
What was he looking for?
Any ideas?
I don't know the details, but...
He was asking about any documents from the fifth research laboratory
And the murder of Major General Hyuza
After all, thanks to Major General I got this job
Oh, right
Well, today, as always, we have a lot of work
I'll leave you
Yes, sir
Good morning, Shesuka
Yes?
What?
Hello
Hello
You've lost some weight
Yes
Are you hurt?
A small sprain in the south
Just a scratch
I see
By the way, I met the Felric brothers there
Coincidence?
They visited their sensei in Dobles
Major
Yes?
Did you tell them about Hyuza?
No, I couldn't
They'll find out sooner or later
I know, sir
The fifth research laboratory and the Philosopher's Stone
Living people like material for a stone
This guy just loved to help everyone
He put his nose into the investigation of the Felric brothers and found out what he didn't follow
That's why you didn't want to tell them?
If they find out that Hyuza died because of the case they dragged him into
It will break them
You have a kind heart
And you learned a lot
And close to the puzzle
Be careful
You never know who can hear you
I'll go
Lieutenant Houkai
How cold is it?
If you're here, then...
Sorry for the wait
I knew it
Oh, it's all metal
What the hell are you doing here, colonel?
I was transferred to the capital a month ago
Why did you bring me here?
Well, I need to share information
And also say hello to Lieutenant Colonel Hyuza
How is he doing?
He's not here
He decided to return to the province
He took his wife and daughter and left
I heard he was going to open a family business
So he's not here
That's a shame
We wanted to see him
It's all metal
Don't be a fool and don't do stupid things
Of course
Such moments, you keep them for children?
Now they don't need to know
It will be better if nothing will stop them from moving forward
But they will know everything over time
I don't want to call Major Armstrong soft-hearted
It's not soft-heartedness
It's cruelty
So there's no colonel here, damn it
Oh, I almost forgot, brother
We need to tell Inri
She went home to them
Right
Young Lieutenant Ross
I haven't seen you for a long time
Where are you in such a hurry?
We found out about Colonel Hyuza
I see, it's hard, isn't it?
I wanted to tell him so much
I didn't say goodbye to him properly
Did anyone tell you?
Don't worry
The army did a good job of escorting him
Really? You guys are great
Of course
Besides, you know, with a special order
He was promoted to Major General
He was promoted to Major General
With a special order?
He was promoted to Major General
He was promoted to Major General
With a special order?
He was promoted to leave the province?
Lieutenant Ross

Here you go
Thank you
What are you talking about?
Why him? Why?
Why me?
Brother
General Hyuza was killed
Not long after you were released
You were released from the hospital
We didn't catch the criminal
It's my fault
I dragged Lieutenant Colonel Hyuza into this
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
no
What are you thinking?
I'll tell them everything.
Stay behind me.
I'm the only one who has to answer for everything.
It's not just your fault.
It's both of us.
That's why I'm going too.
Hey, Al.
What if we decided to return our bodies at any cost, but...
If people die because of this, I prefer to stay like this.
And Winry-chan has already come.
We know.
Winry.
Gracie-san.
Gracie-san.
I have to tell you something.
May I?
Me?
Yes.
And Winry too.
So, my husband knew something about the Philosopher's Stone?
Is this a warning?
To everyone who wants to get into their business?
We dragged him into all this.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
He died helping others.
He looked like him.
He liked to interfere in other people's business
and help people.
And it always ended badly for him.
I'm sorry.
Even at the moment of his death.
We...
Don't you dare give up.
If you give up now,
it will mean that my husband died in vain.
Even if it doesn't work out with the Philosopher's Stone,
there will be another way.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
There will be another way, right?
Gracie-san.
Don't stop on your way.
Mom.
Don't cry, mommy.
I'm sorry.
Winry.
Are you still here?
And you still haven't said anything?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
You can go now.
I'm sorry.
Winry.
Are you still here?
I haven't eaten anything yet, the restaurant will close soon.
Okay.
You won't last long without food.
Yes.
Well, I'm going to my room.
An apple pie?
I baked it many times, I practiced.
I practiced a lot.
I don't want to brag, but I'm not bad at it.
I'm not as good as Gracie-san.
One day...
I wanted to treat them to hiyoza-san.
Episode 2
The colonel is trying to dig up something about the death of hiyoza.
Yes.
I'm afraid he won't dig up anything.
He can.
What should we do?
We transferred him to the capital to keep an eye on him.
And what will happen to him?
He's a candidate, a valuable victim.
Did you get any information from your colonel?
Nothing.
I don't even know if he's a fool or pretending.
I'll try to get something out of him.
Let's go, Gluttony.
What do you want, Gluttony?
You need to clean up after yourself.
Damn, really.
Hey, Last.
We need to take out the fire alchemist.
We do.
What if we do something else?
Have you come up with something?
We need to put a bone in the gnawing dog.
Young Lieutenant Mariaros.
I'm Henry Douglas from the military police headquarters.
How can I help you?
Come with me.
The gun.
Let me explain.
You are the main suspect in the case of the killing of Miles Hughes.
What nonsense?
Your objections will be heard later.
Come with me.
Young Lieutenant Mariaros.
Mariaros denies everything.
Find out everything about her.
And quickly.
And don't forget the conspiracy.
Yes, sir.
Give me back the flowers, man.
You're not going on a date, are you?
Oh, you bastard.
I made you wait, Solaris.
No, I just came.
I missed you so much, Jean.
Tell me some other interesting story.

The flame of hatred swallows the sacrificial fireman
and leaves behind only hatred and regret for our boy,
and the man turns towards the darkness.
