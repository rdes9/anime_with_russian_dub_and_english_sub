To find out the secrets of the Rintan Jutsu, Ed and Al try to find Mai-Chan
and find out that she went to the north.
At the same time, Bagrov's alchemist pursues Shurama, who fled from the capital to the west.
But under the cover of the darkness, Shurama manages to escape from the military.
If he wanted to jump off the train, he probably chose the steepest climb, on which the train reduces the speed.
Well, where could he go next?
Has anyone seen him?
We were not informed of anything.
That's strange.
Before that moment, he was constantly on the lookout.
Allow me to report.
A boat was stolen from the harbor, about 200 meters south of here.
Was it Shurama?
When this happened, there was no one there.
Find out everything.
Yes, sir.
I report.
A local old man saw two suspicious people moving west.
So west?
Gather a search squad and capture these two.
Yes, sir.
Something wrong?
No.
It's just...
It's a map.
The road to the north is marked on it, but...
It's crossed out.
It was a forest trail leading to the northern region.
But there were constant earthquakes in this area, so now the passage is prohibited there.
Do you think they are there?
There are a lot of similar areas in the road.
They are covered with sludge.
Has the flow of water changed direction?
No, sir.
It's just...
It's just...
It's just...
It's just...
It's just...
It's just...
It's just...
Has the flow of water changed direction?
It looks like it.
But why?
For alchemy and destruction on which he specializes, such obstacles are not a problem.
What?
And then he could easily block the road again.
Traces of re-education?
Send the soldier to the north.
Episode thirty-three, Northern Skalabrix.
Snow!
Brother!
You're so clumsy, brother!
Leave me alone!
I just slipped.
There's so much snow here.
Yeah.
You won't see this in Risenburg.
Right!
Do you remember when we were kids?
There was a blizzard in Risenburg.
Do you remember?
A blizzard?
I remember, I remember!
We also waged a war with the snowmen.
And made a snowman.
Yeah.
When I was a kid, I didn't think that one day I would be in the North.
Yeah.
And here we are.
Well, what are we going to do?
We still have time to get the train going to Brix.
Don't you want to try the local cuisine?
I'm not hungry.
Let's go find something.
I'm hungry.
I'm hungry.
I want to eat something.
I want to eat something.
I want to eat something.
I want to eat something.
I want to eat something.
I want to eat something.
If you run, you'll fall again.
Stay away.
Hey, what's up?
I'm sorry, sir.
I have some news.
I'm very sorry, sir.
But we're doing our best.
A man with a worse frame was spotted near the North station.
Is that true?
No doubt.
He got on the train to Brix.
He was alone?
He was a dark-haired middle-aged man, as reported in the report.
Stop this train immediately.
There's no need for that.
If he suspects something, he can jump off it again.
Now I'm going to do my job.
You'd better not get in the way.
Sleep as long as you can.
It will be so cold where we're going that you won't be able to sleep even if you want to.
Let's go.
I'm going to jump.
Please, keep your speed.
Yes, sir.
Dr. Marko.
I came to take you.
You have nowhere else to run.
Are you alone here?
Where's the scar?
Don't you know when to stop?
Didn't I tell you that you have nowhere to run?
Dr. Marko...
Who are you?
Are you the famous Ishvarit?
Are you happy to replace these monsters?
It's time to run away.
Where are you going?
Zolf J. Kimble.
An alchemist.
Do you remember me?
Yes, I remember you very well.
Are you from Ishvarit?
The people who were there.
Is this your family?
And the guy in the glasses looks a lot like you.
The blood was dripping from him like a fountain.
It looks like he was experiencing an incredible battle.
Skvern.
After so many years in the cell, I lost my form.
He continued to fight all this time even after the war.
I give in to him.
But he can only destroy.
You say it's an incredible pain?
I won't leave you time to pray to God.
What a shame.
Let one Ishvarit run away twice.
You will pay for this humiliation.
I hope next time we will finish with this Ishvarit.
Kimble.
What are you doing here?
I'm going to kill you.
Kimble.
Damn, I can't see anything.
What was that noise?
The rear wagons disappeared.
Don't do this.
The military ordered us not to stop.
I don't care about them.
If the train goes off the rails, we will be responsible for it.
Hey, what happened here?
Who allowed you to stop the train?
Continue the movement.
To the north.
Great death.
She came for me.
Death follows those who cause it.
I always go hand in hand with death.
My work is so great because it is on the eve of my life.
This is the highest reward that I could get in my battle.
I hope I'm not hurt.
Yuki-san, everything is fine.
Nobody is following us.
So the plan to distract the military is working.
I'm sure they will do it.
Marco-san.
It's okay.
My skin is very sensitive to the northern wind.
I'm sorry.
I should have tried to make your face more attractive.
Everything is fine.
I don't deserve anything else.
I'm satisfied.
Mei-chan, look.
This is the mountain ridge of Brix.
These mountains serve the natural border with the huge northern country, Drachma.
Soon we will be at the place that Shura pointed out.
Well...
We're almost there.

What?
Did they leave the hotel?
Yes, yesterday.
Do you know where they went?
I think they said something about the north.
I see. Thank you.
You're welcome.
Jiturin!
What's wrong?
How are the brothers?
They told me they went to the north.
Oh my God!
That means...
They will die there.
Brother, are you cold?
I'm cold.
Damn Brix.
Here we are, guys.
This road will lead you straight to the fortress of Brix.
Thank you.
Oh, you.
Yes, you.
Is this a car armor?
No.
I see. Then everything is fine.
What's going on?
Who knows?
Behind this fence begins the territory of the military.
If you go off the road, you will be killed.
What?
Let's go.
Yeah.
So the weather in the mountains changes quickly, huh?
That's just a piece of shit.
What are we going to do, brother?
We have finally hit the road.
Don't be afraid.
Izumi sensei spent a whole month in these mountains during training.
And nothing happened to her.
Liar!
A person will not survive here for a whole month.
She said she even killed a bear.
Liar! I heard that bears in Brix are more than two meters high.
When they stand on their hind legs.
It can't be that she killed such a thing.
Bear!
No, not a bear.
Hey, stop.
This is an army uniform.
So you also have a car armor.
But it's so useless.
I would be a cow and a man, a captain without a bite.
You will never understand the beauty of the works of engineering art.
The pathetic likeness of a spy.
This is a combat car armor M1913A.
Crocodile.
Come on, if you don't want me to execute you on the spot.
Drachman's rat.
A spy?
What are you talking about?
What the hell?
Stupid Yeti.
Where does this pain come from?
The car armor doesn't move.
I got you.
Brother.
Mammoth.
Listen to what they tell you.
Do you still resist?
But not this.
Stop, stop, stop, stop.
What are you doing?
I'll get rid of you from this useless hand.
The only one who will stay here without a hand will be you.
What was that?
Stop.
Time out, time out.
Why didn't the alchemy work?
Isn't that right?
Brother.
Thank you, Al.
How are you?
You bastard.
Now, even if we survive in this snowstorm, Winry will kill me.
Not bad, man.
You could stand even with such a pathetic car armor.
But that's it.
The Briggs garrison?
There you are.
They sent a gun to me again.
Brother.
The wall.
What's going on here, Captain Buccaneer?
Ma'am, I apologize for the noise.
Lieutenant General Armstrong.
What?
Armstrong?
She wanted to introduce us to Major.
Olivia Mila Armstrong.
Major's older sister.
But...
They don't look like a drop.
She's not that big.
Who are you?
I'm Edward Alaric, an all-metal alchemist.
Major Armstrong asked me to meet with you, Lieutenant General.
Could you call your people back?
Search them.
What?
I said we're not spies.
So what?
Anyone can know the names of famous people.
He's empty?
Idiots.
It's him.
General.
It's a letter of recommendation from Major Louis Armstrong.
Read it and you'll understand that we're not spies.
It's actually from Alex.
You're not going to read it?
The letter of recommendation means nothing to me.
I'm not interested in the opinion of others.
I prefer to judge people myself.
Wow!
It's huge!
I wonder what it is.
Come in, alchemist.
It's incredible!
It's so high!
You're going to keep screaming like an idiot,
and I'm going to pull this stupid antenna out of your head.
You're still a child.
I'm not going to mess with you.
These are the mountains of Briggs.

This is the research of Shurama's older brother.
They combine the Rintan Zetsu Kusin and Alchemia of the Mistress.
Do you think the path to immortality is indicated there?
Who knows.
This notebook gives us hope, but it can also turn into a terrible disappointment.
Well, let's start decoding it.
Princess Briggs Mila Olivia Armstrong.
Her unwavering power holds the northern border of the Mistress on the castle.
She is not afraid of anything, as if her heart was pierced from the ice.
Next time, the goal on the metal alchemist episode 34 Snow Queen.
Watch how we in Briggs deal with problems.
