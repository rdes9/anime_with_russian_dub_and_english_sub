Don't tell me, where is the one and a half Mustang?
Wait a second, can I know your name?
I am a private therapist, Knox.
Give him this, he knows me.
A solid metal alchemist.
The final episode.
The end of the journey.
Hello, young lady.
Glad to meet you again.
Who is this?
This man came here on business.
You can say he is our savior.
How is he?
Is everything really so bad?
The grain cultures on the Shwar territory give two crops a year.
This is not quite true.
It is correct to say once every six months.
People will not believe you if you get confused in terms of concepts.
I know.
So let's continue.
What cultures give a harvest once every six months?
Wheat and cotton.
Correct.
And how do you know that?
Don't underestimate me.
I've been studying this question for a long time.
He said that before he becomes a Fuhrer, he must restore the Shwar.
Restore?
But he became a Fuhrer.
This voice is Dr. Knox?
Well, hello.
I did not expect to see you immersed in work.
Yes, this noisy company does not let me rest.
But I'm actually not about that.
Your eyes.
And this?
The truth punished me for my dreams about the future or something like that.
And how are you now?
I don't even know.
But I can't back down from my goal.
To become a Fuhrer?
Or restore the Ishwar?
The destruction of the Ishwar.
That's where it all started.
Your truth.
That's where it all started for us and you.
But I will restore justice.
Justice?
I will cancel the laws that oppress the Ishwarites.
And I will allow the people of Ishwar to return to their holy land.
We have a lot of work to do.
But our plan would never succeed without the help of the Ishwarites and the Ishwarites.
And we will pay them back.
Colonel, I got the books you asked for.
Let them atone for our sins, but we will start a new era.
God, you give.
Hey, Marco-san.
I think we can move on to business.
Marco?
Dr. Marco?
Colonel Mustang.
I have a Philosopher's Stone.
With its help, you can regain your sight.
I see.
I used the life of the Ishwarites to create this stone.
It may seem absurd,
but I'm sure they want to help you revive the Ishwar.
Of course, I can't hear their voices.
But let it be my personal request.
For the sake of the future Ishwar, I want to use this stone to help you.
They will be angry at me for this.
Especially the metal one.
And yet I agree.
You will not regret what you have done.
But first...
There is a man who needs this stone more than I do.
I need to help him first.
Yes?
I've been with you for 80 years.
You, Brad, what happened?
What?
You're going to the capital?
Well, if I find out as soon as I get there, then of course.
How are your wounds and scars?
Why did you save me?
I was supposed to save you.
But the circumstances have changed.
Mustang gave Miles to do the revival of Ishwar with him.
Yes, I decided to take you with me.
Of course, we will destroy all records about you.
So, will you help me restore the church of Ishwar?
You cannot allow our faith and history to be destroyed.
You cannot allow our faith and history to be forgotten.
After all, when culture dies, the people die.
With your own hands, you will save our people from death.
Why am I still alive?
Do you want me to continue my search, brother?
Okay.
I'm with you.
Lead me where you think is necessary.
Okay, Miles, you're next.
Be careful.
Yes, sir.
When Mustang finds out that Shram is alive, he will burst with anger.
Shram, what's your real name?
I died twice.
And I no longer exist for this world.
I don't need a name.
Call me whatever you want.
I see.
See you again, Ishwarid.
Are you okay?
I didn't think my muscles were so atrophied.
Do you want me to carry you?
No.
I'll come back home on my own two.
I'll go slowly, so you can go ahead.
No, we started this journey together.
Together we will finish it.
Then let's go home together.
Yes.
Brother, your leg.
Yes.
I haven't repaired it for a long time.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
You're welcome.
Thank you.
For what?
Well...
You're strange.
I wonder if the others have already arrived from Doxing?
Well, two months have passed.
I'm sure they're already at home.
I hope everything is fine with Mei.
Don't worry.
I'm sure she can handle it.
Mei.
Osama.
What's wrong with you?
No, nothing.
Hey, Princess-chan.
Link-yao.
Don't look at me so angrily.
You're a fool.
You made so much noise in a foreign country because of a philosophical stone that you couldn't get.
The next emperor will be Yao.
But don't worry.
The Yao clan will protect your family.
In front of you is the one who took on the embodiment of greed.
In my heart, there will be enough space for the Chan family and for the rest of the clans.
Why are you staring at me like that?
Don't be afraid.
The people of Xing always keep their word.
Unite all the clans.
You're incredibly greedy, Link-yao.
It's all his bad influence.
Well, it's time for us to go home.
Are you leaving already?
Yes, I want to bury it in my homeland.
See you.
Yes, we'll see each other again.
So much has happened.
Yeah.
By the way, Alphonse-kun,
I thought Princess Xing Mei-chan put her eyes on you.
She's such a cute girl.
And you and Winry, brother?
Dan, do you remember me?
Clients?
Dan, don't tickle me!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
i'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
no
i'm sorry.
to be honest
Sorry.
Sorry.
Am I a fan of you?
No.
Come on!
And nothing!
Well, not bad.
Brother, why are you stuck there?
I'm tired of being a local attraction, damn it!
And Winry has done so much work for me!
And in general!
Winry bakes apple pie and brews tea.
Yes?
Wow, amazing view!
Yeah!
The world is so huge!
Yes!
Brother, we need to discuss something with you.
What?
I guess so.
I thought about it myself.
How are you doing at work?
So many problems!
I have a feeling that I have aged by 20.
I could say that in the east everyone is filled with Mustang-kun,
and in the north Armstrong-kun.
Well, in a quiet capital even the old Rasmatic can sit in the chair of the Fuhrer.
You can't come up with a better one.
Maybe it's time to give way to the young?
Well, no.
I still have to learn from these guys.
Come on!
You speak exactly like my ex-husband.
He was just involved in his work.
God with you, I just ...
I'm kidding!
Selim, what happened?
Booboo birds, help her!
Help me!
Oh, oh, oh!
She needs a vet!
Will the bird get better?
Of course!
Take her to the uncle.
He grows up to be such a kind boy.
Yes.
Everyone was talking to me when I decided to leave him,
but he grows up like an ordinary child.
And yet we will continue to watch over him.
You understand that he is waiting for him.
If we notice something unusual,
I promise that nothing like this will happen.
Homunculus and man.
I wonder if they will ever understand each other.
More curious and more curious.
Edward Kuhn was upset because he had never returned his leg.
Not at all!
He took it as his punishment and reconciled with him.
I see.
He also says that otherwise Inari would have been offended.
Really?
They are like a real couple.
I'm glad you returned your body.
I'm sure he's glad for you too.
In addition to Yuzo-san, we met a lot of good people in our journey.
They did a lot for us, sometimes not realizing it themselves.
Now it's our turn to return the debt.
Is this the same exchange that you have just talked about?
No, according to this principle, if you received 10, then you can only return 10.
But if you add 10 to your heart, you can give another person 11.
Let it not be so much, but this is a new theory that we created with our brother.
And now we are going to prove it.
And what are you going to do?
Once we were unable to save our friend.
I think I will never be able to forget her.
Welcome!
Jels-san, Zanpana-san!
Yo!
We have a lot of food here, join us!
Of course!
Excuse me, can I have a glass of milk and a sandwich?
Yes!
I'm sorry, but I have to go now.
Can I have a sandwich?
Yes!
So you met everyone?
Yes!
So the time has come?
Yes, I'm going to Sing.
I will meet May there and this time I will definitely teach Rin Tantjitsu.
But that's not all.
Surely in other eastern countries, and all over the world, there is something to learn.
I want to go around the world on my own feet and see it with my own eyes.
But are you sure you want to come with me?
Of course!
Traveling with you brings us luck, and this is not some kind of sign.
This is what our animal instinct says.
Alphonse, we are looking for a way to return our former bodies.
You yourself told us not to give up, not to wait for help from others, but to do everything yourself.
Yes!
And your brother will not go to Sing?
No, I'm going to the east, and my brother will study the sciences of the west.
And when we combine these knowledge, the tragedy that happened to Nina will never happen again.
But that's not all.
My brother and I want to see the whole world.
Grease it every day.
And make sure all the screws are tightly tightened.
And do not forget to wipe it as follows after the bath.
Hey, are you listening to me?
Oh my God!
Here he is!
If you climb on the horn again, you will soon have to return to fix the car armor.
Yes, yes, I know.
If you need repairs, promise that you will call and make an appointment with me in advance.
Yeah.
Make an appointment in advance.
What?
Winry
Come on, say it already.
It will be an equal exchange!
I'll give you half of my life, and you give me half of yours!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'll give you half of my life, and you give me half of yours!
Oh, these alchemists and their words.
Equal exchange?
Couldn't you come up with something more stupid?
What are you?
You're a fool!
What half? I'll give you everything!
Wait, this is too much.
Maybe 90 is not 80% or 70, although, what about 85?
I think it's exactly the same.
What?
Ed!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Ed!
I can't, but you give.
I can't listen to you, but you give.
I can't listen to you, but you give.
To listen to you is the principle of equal exchange.
It's just a joke.
Are you kidding me?
No.
I haven't laughed like that in a long time.
Thank you.
I'll be back soon.
Yeah?
Have a nice trip.
Well, Edward Kuhn also left.
It's time for these boys to grow up.
I like them more.
It would be boring with a guy who is sitting in the same place all the time.
You can't take advantage of a lesson that doesn't hurt.
You can't take advantage of a lesson that doesn't hurt.
You can't take advantage of a lesson that doesn't hurt.
You can't take advantage of a lesson that doesn't hurt.
Because when you want to get something, you have to sacrifice something.
But those who find the strength to overcome pain and learn the lesson
will receive a reward for the heart, whose will cannot be broken.
Yes.
A purposeful metal heart.
I'm going to the world you haven't seen yet.
I was lost.
I was traveling under the mouse-colored sky.
A map of the day.
Many dreams were blurred.
It's the sound.
I'm going to the world you haven't seen yet.
A map of the day.
Many dreams were blurred.
It's the sound.
I was lost.
I was traveling under the mouse-colored sky.
A map of the day.
Many dreams were blurred.
It's the sound.
I was traveling under the mouse-colored sky.
A map of the day.
Many dreams were blurred.
It's the sound.
I was traveling under the mouse-colored sky.
A map of the day.
Many dreams were blurred.
It's the sound.
I was traveling under the mouse-colored sky.
A map of the day.
Many dreams were blurred.
The End
