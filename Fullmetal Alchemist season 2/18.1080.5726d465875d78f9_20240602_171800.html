        <pre>White scenery is inviting me now
I'm going to a world I haven't seen yet
A solid metal alchemist
I was lost, I was wandering under the mouse-colored sky
A map of the day
Many dreams were blurred
Someday, even if I'm small
I wonder if I can go to the other side of that cloud
Like a strong and wounded heart
The raindrops that fell on the ground
Repeatedly
A straight light crosses
As I tell you where I'm going
I'll go through anywhere
I'll burn a faint remnant in my eyes
No matter where I go under this sky
I'm going to a world I haven't seen yet
I don't know all the details myself
A simple order has been given to take you to Risenburg to meet with the rest of the group
To meet with who?
Good afternoon, Major Armstrong
And...
I'm the boss
Young Lieutenant Brad
Episode 18 in the hands of an exhausted man
Maybe Brad has already reached Risenburg
And still hasn't called
Strange, if he needs a repair, I'm here
We know so little, especially about the case of Lieutenant Ross
That's why I'm here
And how long ago?
And how did you get here?
Through the window
Well, I'm a fugitive criminal now
Well, you don't have to worry about Edward
Right now he is
It's hot
Damn colonel
And he didn't say a word about the desert
Hans, it's still far away
We're almost there
You see, the ruins of Xerxes
I almost got burned by the armored car
Why did you bring the boy?
There is one thing
Xerxes means...
I remember reading about him in the stories about the Wisdom of the East
Wisdom of the East?
Yes
The scientist who brought alchemy to our country
This is a legend about the only man who survived in the kingdom of Xerxes
Which was destroyed in one night
About how he came to the newly founded Amestris and brought alchemy
According to our country, this man came from the west
Ran Teng Jitsu, which we are now using
A mix of his knowledge and the traditional teaching of Xing
Teaching based on medicine?
Yes
We honor him deeply
We call him the Wisdom of the West
And your wisdom was born here?
Yes, that's what the legend says
Wow
I wanted to see the ruins of Xerxes
Now I understand why
But how could such a developed civilization die in one night
Despite all his knowledge?
Probably this is just a legend
What are you doing here?
We've come a long way
Edward Kuhn
The places I served in the East were just magnificent
No bustle of the city and a lot of beautiful women
But Colonel
Young Lieutenant Ross
Let's hug
I'll hold on
Young Lieutenant Ross
We will have problems if someone in the country comes across a living dead
So we took her
So the colonel all this time knew that Lieutenant Ross was innocent?
It hurts to see it
Do you think so too?
Yes
She is arrested by everyone
And then she gets on the front lines
But usually such cases are silenced
On the line
A call from Colonel Foreman on the open line
Connect
Colonel, I'm about to kill Major General Hughes
Hey, Foreman, give me a minute
Barry
Yo, Mustangs, did you read the newspaper?
I have something interesting for you
You know, Bunny, this line is not for personal talk
I'll call you back from the machine, wait a minute
What? Is that true?
Yes, this bullet Lieutenant Ross let me in
Thanks to her, I now have a hole in my right hand
I think we can do something
Barry, won't you break off the coils?
Oh, got it, don't kill
Second alley in the warehouse, right?
Brad, quickly find these ingredients
Pork, bone, coal, ammonia
What is all this for? To make a burned body
Human transformation?
Don't even think about it
It will be something very similar to a burned body
But when it's open, everything will turn out
I'll light it up so they won't be able to figure it out
And what will you do if they start checking your teeth?
I have everything under control
Will it work?
I'm not a specialist in anatomy, but my knowledge is enough
I'm good at burning bodies
Hurry up
Are you Maria Ross?
This is nonsense
You're going to die today
There's no time to stare
Shh
Shh
Yo, solid metal
What does that mean, colonel?
What? Solid metal boss?
It's not going according to plan
Edward Kuhn
Okay, the colonel will take care of everything
Let's go
Yes, sir
While Barry was taking Lieutenant Ross out of prison, he met a young gentleman
And the young gentleman ordered me to escort her to the east
We agreed to meet here so that you could escort Lieutenant Ross
That's it!
Although I don't like it
The colonel dragged us into all this
The personal meeting is much more convincing than any explanation, isn't it?
Okay, okay
This time the colonel was right
By the way, about the colonel
I remember he just said that the case was only damaging his nose here
What kind of boy was he talking about?
What the hell?
What are you talking about?
Is there anything else besides saving Lieutenant Ross?
Yes
We are going to catch a big fish from the army leadership
How do I see it?
Catch?
Barry, who knows all the secrets of the fifth research laboratory, got out of there and made a noise
They will go all out to get rid of him
Fullmetal Alchemist
Sounded for free
Fullmetal Alchemist
So that's how it is
It turns out they took this just so he wouldn't get caught under his feet
Well, you could say that
Well, I helped them in exchange for Barry's body
But the truth is
The alchemist who gave me this body has been dead for a long time, and I don't even know myself
What? That's not fair
By the way, this guy Alphonse is the same as me
Why don't you ask him?
So I decided to visit you
It's a promise, I'm counting on you
But somehow I have nothing to do with this promise
I have nothing to do with this
Yellowstone, homunculus
How did I end up in all this?
Now we don't have enough information
But the situation will change when we find out the truth about the hidden murder of Major General Hughes
Then we will remove false accusations from you
General...
Hughes
I can't believe there's no more of him
And what are you going to do?
Don't stop on your way
Although we have committed a serious sin, there are people who want to help us
There are those who scold and support us
I have a younger brother who I promised to return our bodies
Besides, I have nowhere to return our bodies
Otherwise, all I have to do is move forward
And on this path, I will no longer allow the death of my dear people
And I will protect everyone who needs my protection
It will be difficult
I can't always protect myself
Maybe I can't protect others
I can't always protect myself
Maybe I'm too self-confident
But I can't do anything else
So I'm going forward
Lieutenant Ross, do you have any plans?
Yes, I'm going to Xing
Do you have anything to tell your parents?
No
They may find out that I'm alive
Then we will have troubles
I see
Major Armstrong, Lieutenant Pred
Please tell Colonel Mustang
I thank you from the bottom of my heart for saving me
If you need my help, I'll come right away
I'm ready to give my life to help you
Don't hang your nose, Edward Kuhn
I didn't pay you back for the slap
Next time
Yeah, next time
You have good friends
Fu San, Xing, what is he like?
A wonderful country, wonderful food and kind people
Don't worry
So after the desert, I'm waiting for the earthly paradise
Yes
However, crossing the desert is a difficult challenge
Be careful
You have to be careful
I'll go to your store tomorrow, Elizabeth
What do you want, dear?
Sorry, Roy
Kate, we have a visitor
Call Jacqueline
Jacqueline, we have a visitor
Got it
Yeah
Barry, it's easier, Farman
You can't kill him
No
Smell of tobacco
Junior Lieutenant Havok?
Idiot, what do you think?
I'm wearing a mask
This means no combat experience
I'm sorry
You're just random victims
So be quiet
The military must be watching us
You...
Let's go outside
But there can also be enemies
We have everything under control
Damn it!
Lieutenant!
Don't be afraid, the eye of the falcon is watching us
I heard a noise, is something wrong?
Nothing
The visitor came to Jacqueline
We had to hang him
Damn it!
You're so cruel, Elizabeth
That's it, sit
We have a lot to ask you
Does he even understand what I'm saying?
Hey, are you kidding me?
This is...
My own body!
What?
How can this be?
They probably put some laboratory rat in his soul
And now he came for his soul
What memories!
I haven't seen him since I was thrown out of my soul
Transforming circle
It looks like the one I saw in the fifth laboratory
Two-headed dragon, sun
Sun
Damn it!
I can't figure it out without the upper part
What do you want?
If you have the money...
And the jewelry
Dude, dude
You won't give up on becoming our hostage
Dude, you won't give up on becoming our hostage
so that we can demand the army to return our lands
The army won't even move a finger for some boy
The civil war started because of the death of a child
You never know what the course of history can turn
Stop it, don't be ashamed
We have a chance
You fools
You want to bring shame on Shvara
You can let him go
He won't attack you anymore
Why did you save me?
You hate Amistrians, don't you?
I know that not all Amistrians are evil
And me and Shana Sama saved Amistrian doctors from death during the war
I won't lie, we despise you, but I wouldn't be standing here if it weren't for that family
Family?
Are you talking about the Rotbells?
Do you know the Rotbell doctors?
Well, yes
They saved so many Isharites during the war
I see
So Uncle and Aunt Rot were...
They stayed with us despite the fact that the front line was getting closer
How did they die?
They were killed by a patient
Isharite that they saved
No
We're sorry
We couldn't stop him
Who was it?
I couldn't see his face
But he had a tattoo on his right hand
If there's a chance, please worship them from our name
We thank them and ask for forgiveness
The Last Supper
That's great
Who else would have a chance to get a body?
Hey, you promised not to kill him
What the hell?
My soul is burning, I want to cut him
You can't
Besides, don't you want to go back to your body?
This body won't last long
It's falling apart
I can't stand it
I'm going to strangle him
I have to decide what to do with my own body
I said no, damn it
What's going on?
The situation is getting worse
It looks like the buyer is causing a conflict
I'll call you back
I have to go, too
