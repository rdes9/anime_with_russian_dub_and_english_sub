        <pre>Alchemy is a science that studies the structure of matter, its compression and reconstruction. However, it is not omnipotent and does not allow you to create something out of nothing.
In order to get something, it is necessary to give something equal in return. This is the principle of equal exchange, the main basis of alchemy.
Transformation of man is the main stage of alchemy. This prohibition is not allowed to violate anyone.
It is still a long life to erase this feeling. I want to try to do what I left behind.

Brother, what do you think about the rumors about the priest from Leor? Another wizard? They say he turns the air into flowers. It's probably just a trick.
It's probably just a trick.
What if it's not?
Yeah, maybe it's what we're looking for.
A divine stone that destroyed Xerxes overnight. A great elixir created by the Eastern Wisdom. It has many names, and this is what all alchemists long for.

What's the matter, Al?
Damn, why is it the only thing that's written about it?
Al, yes?
It would be good if this time the stone turned out to be real.
Yeah, exactly. Episode 2, the day when it all started.
Eh?
Ten years ago.
Al?
Risenburg.
Where are you?
Oh my God!
You turned over your father's office again!
Hey, don't scratch the floor!
This is not Karakuli.
Look!
Is this alchemy?
Did your father teach you this?
How could he teach us to those who are not around?
We learned about it from books.
Learned from books?
We did something bad, right?
No, not at all.
Well done, boys.
This is what you should expect from your father's children.
Now I'm going to brag to everyone.
Mom praised us.
We were so happy, and that's why we became even more interested in alchemy.
But in the same summer, during the epidemic, mom fell ill and died.
Brother, I want to eat.
It's so cold here, let's go home.
If dad comes back...
Don't you dare talk about him!
He's not our father.
He didn't even come to mom's funeral.
Trisha Elric, 1878-1904
If only we could bring mom back...
But in one of the books it was written that human transformation is prohibited.
Then let it be our secret.
You're sitting here again.
What do you need, Winry?
Grandma says that if we cry for those who left us,
these people will be very sad in another world.
And we don't cry.
You always cry because your parents never come home.
And you stay alone.
Me? I never cry.
Really?
I was worried about you all this time.
If you come home later, you won't get dinner.
What are you doing? Stop!
Wait for me!
Bon appetit!
Ed, you should drink some milk too.
I hate milk.
If you don't drink milk, you'll always be such a brat.
Who did you call a brat? Garlic crock?
What did you say, bean?
Mini-crock!
Micro-bean!
You're even less than an ant!
And you're less bad.
You read your book at school again.
You have to listen to what the teacher says.
Leave me alone!
What book are you reading?
It's a secret.
It's none of your business, Winry.
It's not fair.
You always keep it a secret.
See you later.
Ed, Alf, we have stewed vegetables for dinner tonight.
Awesome!
Awesome!
Okay, see you in the evening.
The man who invented stewed vegetables is a real genius.
They are delicious even though they are added with milk.
Ed, what are you talking about?
The idea of adding milk to vegetables is great on its own.
To make a breakthrough in science, you always need fresh ideas.
Really?
Of course!
The same thing with human transformation.
From that moment on, we started to study human transformation
in order to resurrect mom.
We improved our alchemy skills by training with the teacher.
It took many years, but I want to see mom's smile again.
I want to be happy with her again.
These thoughts helped us move forward.
Ed, Alf, we have stewed vegetables for dinner tonight.
Awesome!

Ed, Alf, we have stewed vegetables for dinner tonight.
Three grams of cream.
Great! Now we need to write down the equation.
And finally, the information about the soul.
Let's start, Al.
Okay.
Brother, something's wrong.
This can't be!
It's a return!
Brother!
Brother!
Brother!
Brother!
Brother!
Brother!
Al?
What?
Where am I?
Hello.
Who are you?
Oh, good for you to ask.
Sometimes you people call me the world.
Sometimes the universe, sometimes God.
Sometimes the truth, sometimes everyone.
Sometimes alone.
And I am you.
You are welcome.
You fool, who mistook yourself as God.
Well, well, quiet.
Isn't that what you were striving for?
I will show you the truth.
It seems that all the information in the world with a rapid flow has burst into my head.
Stop! My head is about to explode!
It's tearing me to pieces!
No, stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
I thought my head was about to explode.
But suddenly I understood.
This is the truth.
Mom!
Well, how are you?
Right.
In my theory of human transformation there were no mistakes.
But I missed something.
If I had stayed there a little longer, I would have found what I was looking for.
True knowledge of human transformation.
Please show me again.
No, no, no.
This is all I could show for your input board.
Input board?
Yes, board.
Equal exchange, isn't it, alchemist?
No!
Damn it!
How could this happen?
Everything, everything was supposed to go wrong.
Damn it!
He took her!
Someone, help me!
Mom!
Mommy!
Mommy!
Oh no!
No!
This is not what I wanted!
Alphons!
Alphons!
Alphons!
It's my fault!
Alphons!
Damn it!
Damn it!
Give him back!
He is my younger brother!
Take anything!
Legs, hands!
At least my heart!
Just give him back!
He is my only brother!
Are you still hanging around in the capital?
Now I can finally go back to the eastern headquarters.
Did you do a good job here?
I hope when we meet next time you will be General-Major Mroy.
Easy to say.
Oh yes, if you are already leaving, you should probably look at this.
What is it?
The results of the investigation on the MacDougall case.
You haven't received them yet, have you?
No.
Rintanjutsu Kusinka?
Something like that.
To be honest, I don't understand anything.
Do you know anything about it?
No, I hear for the first time.
By the way, how are the Eureka brothers doing?
I'm not their nanny.
Listen, why did you do this to a state alchemist?
He is still a child.
He will also have to go through the back once in the army.
What about us then?
So you say.
They have already been there.
These two came back from Prizpodniy.
Four years ago.
Lieutenant Colonel,
is there anyone in the yard?
No.
Lieutenant Colonel,
is there anyone in the yard?
This is ...
Where are they?
Where are these Eureka brothers?
Where are they?
Don't make noise, Dan.
Be polite to the guests.
Hey, what the hell do you need an army dog here?
I was just at your house.
What the hell was that?
What have you done?
I'm sorry.
Please forgive us.
Forgive us.
Forgive us.
Forgive us.
Hey,
I came here
because I heard about talented alchemists.
But this ...
What I definitely did not expect
is to see a child who committed
and unsuccessful transformation of a person
and who was able to attach the soul to armor.
With such abilities,
he can become a state alchemist.
State alchemists are used
as live weapons during the war.
But this position opens up new opportunities
where they can continue their research
at a higher level.
Perhaps they will find a way
to return their bodies.
After this child
appeared on my doorstep with bleeding blood.
I went to their house.
That ...
That was not a human.
So alchemy allowed them to create this monster?
Then I'm against it.
Do you want these children
to have to go through hell again?
Please.
Thank you.
Ah ...
Lieutenant-san,
can you call me Lisa?
Lisa Hawkeye. Nice to meet you.
Lisa-san,
did you have to shoot a person?
Yes.
I do not like agents.
Because of them, my father and mother
were at war and were killed.
And now you want to take
me, Ed and Allah?
They decide whether to go with us or not.
Yes.
They themselves have to decide.
I do not force you.
I just list the options.
They decide to move forward
or stay in place.
Live, losing hope with a piece of iron instead of a brother
or sell the soul of the army
in exchange for the opportunities it provides.
The boys themselves have to make a choice.
If there is a path that leads to your cherished goal,
you have to go through it.
Even if you drown in the mud.
Why did you become a soldier,
Lisa-san?
Because there is a person
I must protect.
We're leaving.
Yes, sir.
Well, goodbye, young miss.
My name is Winry.
Okay.
Winry-chan.
I hope to see you again.
Do you think he will come?
Definitely.
But his eyes were so lifeless.
Will you regret it later?
No.
I'm sure of my choice.
How long will the operation and recovery take?
Usually it takes three years.
One year.
You're a bloodthirsty man.
You're a bloodthirsty man.
You're a bloodthirsty man.
You're a bloodthirsty man.
You're a bloodthirsty man.
You're a bloodthirsty man.
You're a bloodthirsty man.
Al, be patient a little longer.
I'll get your real body back.
Okay.
Then you can get your body back too.
Okay.
Episode The Picatinny
Your body's been purified.
Yes.
You can take part in the alchemy training.
I've never used it since.
Right, you've never used it since the day
when I got my soul.
Brother? Oh, the most perfect!
Unbelievable, brother, you did it without a transforming circle!
Just like our teacher!
You can do that too, can't you?
No, brother!
Didn't you see that?
See what?
No, don't think about it.
Hey, did you change the shape of my car armor?
And because of that you decided to change the shape of my head?
Me too!
Car fan! Girls should be cute!
I don't care that I'm not cute!
I like to be a car fan!
I decided to help you until you return your former bodies!
Don't you often watch exams, sir?
Well, I found out that this time the exam is with a 12-year-old boy.
And I came to look at it to see what to tell my son later.
Oh, the hand of steel!
This happened during the Civil War in the East.
Yes, we got our hands dirty in Ishwar.
And who is this?
Idiot! This is the Fuhrer, King Bradley!
Well, let's start the exam.
Do you have anything to draw a transforming circle?
I don't need that.
I don't need that.
A non-transforming circle?
That's impressive!
Your Excellency!
It turns out that it is so easy to kill a big boss.
You guys should come up with another way to pass the exams.
I see your guts are not thin.
But you have no idea how great this world is.
Good luck on the remaining exams!
Good luck on the remaining exams, young alchemist!
When did he manage to take out the sword?
I hope everything is fine at the exam.
Tell me, Al.
What?
If this becomes a state alchemist, you will leave here.
Uhu!
These are the silver clock confirmations of the status of the state alchemist.
Eastern city, Eastern headquarters.
Your testimony and contract.
Here.
The Fuhrer has a peculiar sense of humor.
What?
Nothing.
Congratulations!
Now you have officially become an army son.
I, Fuhrer King Bradley, appoint you, Edward Elric, as the state alchemist.
And I claim the name of the whole metal.
Whole metal?
Yes.
Every state alchemist gets a battle name.
From this moment on, you are a whole metal alchemist.
I like it, it sounds powerful.
It suits me.
Brother, we are almost there.
Leor.
Maybe this is what will bring Al back to his real body.
The Colossus Stone.
The Colossus Stone.
The Colossus Stone.
The Colossus Stone.
The Colossus Stone.
The Colossus Stone.
The Colossus Stone.
When Leor and Ed El arrive, they meet Cornel, a man who claims he can resurrect the dead.
Pray, faith and you will be saved.
These are the words of Cornelius, whose fingers sparkle with red philosophical lights.
Next time on Metal Alchemist.
Episode 3. City of Heretics.
What kind of happiness is it, if it is achieved by the path of logic?
