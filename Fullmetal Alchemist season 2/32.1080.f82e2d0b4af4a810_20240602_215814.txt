How can I say?
It looks like a drawing, but...
Is she talking to us?
It's definitely not her!
I know!
Listen, we don't have time for such nonsense!
And the truth!
Where could she be?
Where could she be?
Episode 32. The son of the Fuhrer
East city! East city!
The last information about Shurami.
You still haven't caught him?
You're such an asshole!
Oh, I'm sorry!
Well, excuse me. I was just looking around.
You've got an unusual outfit.
Where are you from?
I'm from Xinga.
Oh, well.
Do you want to see the sights?
It's a pity, but there aren't many interesting places in the eastern city.
No, I'm just passing by.
I'm going to the north.
Attention! The train from the third platform is going to the northern city.
Oh, no! Thank you for helping, granny!
Take your seats, passengers.
Have a nice trip!
What a strange cat!
Where did he go?
I think I heard footsteps.
There he is!
So he was a dark-haired middle-aged man?
Yes!
That's right! If you believe the report...
He was here yesterday.
It looks like he's a vegan.
No, he's not a vegan.
He's not a vegan.
He's not a vegan.
It looks like he's going to the west.
We've got a few heavy and light wounds.
It's not easy to get a scar, either.
No matter what.
He's attracting too much attention.
Well, let's get back to work.
It doesn't matter.
It's none of my business.
I'm sorry, I'm late.
Someone's getting buried again?
Yeah, it looks like it.
It's so awful.
In my age, I always think that soon you'll be buried too.
Well, what are you talking about, dear lady? You still look so young.
Colonel-General Grumman?
Our meeting was scheduled in front of the grave of Major General Hughes, wasn't it?
I thought, if you chose this place, then the reason is not trivial.
And I took care to come unnoticed.
Well, I expected something like that from such an eccentric person like you, General.
But you managed to surprise me again.
Eccentric? This is a compliment.
So, what happened?
Rentanjitsu.
There must be something about him in the central library, right?
Well, yes.
Since this little girl ran away from us, we will have to find out everything ourselves.
I hope we will find at least some clues here.
So that's how all the high officials in the capital are involved in this.
But you paid too much for this information.
Having lost people who could trust you, you lost everything.
Yes, you are absolutely right.
And even Raven.
Once upon a time, when I was still serving in the capital, he asked me a strange question.
Would you like to create an immortal army?
What kind of immortal army?
He meant the homunculi?
I looked back at him and said it was absurd.
And soon after that, I was transferred to the eastern headquarters.
You were humiliated.
Since then, I have only been doing what I do to solve problems in the east of the country.
By the way, do you remember the rebellion in Liori about the problems?
This mess began after the target of the metal alchemist exposed the deception of the founder of the church of summer.
Yes, I remember.
The city began to panic, but we immediately mobilized the eastern army and could suppress the uprising in Zoroastria.
But at the last minute, the central army came, and the eastern army was disbanded.
After all, that's how it was.
Yes.
After the appearance of the central army, the situation in Liori only worsened.
These bastards are clearly doing something in the capital.
No, I don't want that.
Why can't I just wait for the dismissal?
Your jokes again.
Tell me, Colonel General Grumman, did the head of the whole region plan a quiet old age for himself?
Moreover, having subordinated the eastern army, which is full of strong soldiers who have passed Ishivar.
I left this information about the bond so that you could cry, old man, in a vest.
But you called me here to light a fire in me again?
Damn it!
The capital turns out to be so fun.
It was even able to awaken the ambitions sleeping deep inside the ragged old man.
If you give will to emotions, your makeup will float, dear lady.
Oh, but not this one.
Are you free today?
We could have a cup of tea.
Oh, sorry.
I'm very sorry for such an offer, but ...
Nothing.
Why isn't there a book of Oren Tanjitsu here?
Maybe we should go to Ksing to find out everything in place?
No, traveling through the desert with a car armor is a suicide.
Finally, I found you, Edward Elric.
Mother Major, what are you doing here?
Quiet, quiet, you can't move in the library.
I heard you were looking for a girl with a black and white cat.
Yes, but how did you find out?
Colonel Mustang told me, and he asked me to give it to you.
Looks like she's going north.
A reliable source told me that she went north from the eastern station.
So, to the north. Great, let's go there immediately.
Thank you, Major.
And give my thanks to the colonel.
Wait, wait, don't be so hasty.
Take this.
Well, I'm not going.
What is this?
Recommendation letter.
Take it and meet her.
With her?
Who is she with?
At the northernmost point of Amestris.
She defends the border with Drachma and bears the nickname of the Northern Rock of Brix.
Lieutenant General Tarkov.

Move.
You have nowhere to run, Shram.

You have nowhere to run, Shram.
Where did he go?
Report to the headquarters.
This train is heading to the western city.
Shit.
Damn, there is no information about Rintanjitsu anywhere.
The transformation that May completed at a distance.
This is something ...
I would like to learn from this.
It was necessary to ask her while we were at Dr. Knox.
Rintanjitsu said that this technique is based on medicine.
Is this you, brother of the Fullmetal Alchemist, who constantly wears huge armor?
Well, yes.
Cool.
Wow, decay.
Well, thank you.
But you can't make such a noise in the library.
Oh, sorry.
What are you reading about?
Rintanjitsu.
Rintanjitsu?
This is the alchemy of Xing.
Oh, you need Xing.
But the Elric brothers were able to pass the state test in a country with such a developed alchemy as Amestris.
What could be interesting for you in foreign alchemy of a low level?
I can't tell him that there is another way to return his body and fight homunculi.
Well ...
They say that Rintanjitsu is based on medical techniques.
By studying it, we can save lives even when our doctors are not able to help.
Wow!
I've been waiting for you, brother of the Fullmetal Alchemist.
Al, Alphonse.
Get ready, we're leaving.
Brother, you can't make such a noise in the library.
Wait, did you say we're leaving?
I'll tell you everything on the way.
We don't have much time.
We need to take things from the hotel.
And what is this?
The armor itself called you brother, so you are the state alchemist Edward Sun.
Well, yes.
Great!
That's the legendary Kroch alchemist, as you say.
What?
Well, repeat.
Do you love to fly?
Do you want me to let you fly to Neptune, bunny?
Just kidding.
So rumors were not lying.
You're really pissed when you are called a rat.
Don't dare to touch Selimusun.
You're a rat!
Don't you dare to touch Selim Usano!
Don't shoot at him!
Are you Selim Bradley?
The son of the Fuehrer?
Yes, he is!
What the hell are we doing here?
We need to go to the north.
I don't think we had a choice.
I'm sorry.
But Edward-san admires you so much.
Admires me?
Do you like alchemy, Selim-kun?
Yes.
I dream of learning alchemy and becoming a state alchemist like Edward-san.
Admires you, then.
I really want to help my dad.
You love your father, Fuehrer Bradley, don't you?
Of course!
What kind of father is he?
He is a very noble man.
He takes care of the work from which other people would refuse.
Every day he works hard without giving up so that his people live happily.
I see.
The Fuehrer is constantly busy.
That's right.
He still wants to work hard.
But I think he is too old for that.
And it's time for him to rest.
He devotes himself to work.
And he still remains a fool who doesn't understand a woman's heart.
When we first met, he was so rude that we didn't know who he was.
When we first met, he was so rude that I had to slap him on the cheek.
After that, we started dating.
On our first date...
Oh, I'm sorry.
I was talking too much.
Dad!
I'm sorry.
Welcome back!
Thank you, Selim.
What happened?
I had a free minute.
So I decided to be with you.
Besides, I heard that there is an all-metal alchemist here.
Hello.
We haven't seen each other for a long time.
It seems that we recently met at the headquarters, right?
That's it!
You met at the library?
Yes.
You wanted to say that we don't look like each other?
No, nothing like that.
He is not my own son.
We couldn't have children.
So we adopted Selim from our relatives.
He grew up to be a good boy and he loves his parents very much.
Enough, dad!
You're embarrassing me.
I'm just telling the truth.
Something wrong?
No, it's just that we've only seen you before at work.
And now...
Yes, brother.
Didn't you expect to see you in your ordinary life?
That's right.
Even someone like me has a family.
Although it is a little different from yours.
Dad, are you leaving already?
Yes, it's time to go back to work.
Good luck, state alchemist.
Let's go.
Come to us again.
Of course.
It doesn't look like his wife and son know that Fuhrer Gamonkul...
We're going to the library.
We're going to the north, we need to hurry.
Let's find this girl and find out everything about her.
Yes, sir.
We'll be there in the morning.
Good night.
So you let them leave again.
This is the map of the western region, isn't it?
That's right.
The last time he was seen was here.
And the western city is here.
The scars of the mark disappeared somewhere along the way.
The train is slowing down on steep climbs, isn't it?
You can jump off it at this time, right?
It's not impossible, but it's very dangerous.
Is that clear?
And where are you going?
And where could they go after they jumped off?
To the north?
Or to the south?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.

I don't know.
Only Epven
This is our first North trip, isn't it?
No.
We're sure to see snow.
Snow...
You know, it's weird that snow production that fast, right?
Her golden hair is the language of the flame, born from the ice.
