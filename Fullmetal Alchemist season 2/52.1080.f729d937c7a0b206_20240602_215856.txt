Episode 52 The Unified Force
The Philosopher's Stone? Where did he get it?
Hiding in the smoke again?
Hiding in the smoke again?
Hiding in the smoke again?
I won't make it twice!
A light grenade?
No, a bait!
Damn Philosopher's Stone!
One trick for another!
The Unified Force
The power of the Philosopher's Stone is amazing.
I've already used it and I know what I'm talking about.
I don't understand one thing.
Why do you want to return your body with his help?
Having the Stone in your possession, you could easily run away from us.
And then take advantage of his power to return both your body and your brother's body.
What an unhappy end to your adventure!
But then we won't be able to save the others, but you will fulfill your cherished desire.
You can't get what you want without giving something in return.
I don't understand.
Why only two options?
Either return our bodies or save the world.
Why can I only choose one of them?
Can't I return our bodies and save the world at the same time?
What about equal exchange?
In order to move forward, people must learn how to get new opportunities in spite of the law that has survived.
I see.
So everyone can create a new law that can be subordinated to the world.
Is that what you want to say?
But then there is another option.
You missed the chance to return your previous bodies and couldn't save anyone.
One more time!
Excellent! We managed to pierce his skin!
It hurts!
I'm dying!
I'm sick of it!
I'm sick of dying!
I'm sick of it!
I'm sick of it!
I'm sick of fighting with all my might!
What?
General Lieutenant Armstrong, drop your weapons!
What the hell is this?
Was that him?
Yes.
I missed him.
What about his speed?
He's barely moving.
Sister!
It's just a scratch.
Did you see him?
Barely.
He's so huge and so fast!
The laws of physics don't work on him.
Yes.
I am the fastest homunculus.
Alex!
Looks like he can't control the direction at this speed.
Where...
Finally!
I got you!
It's a beautiful sound.
No, it's nothing more beautiful than the sound that gives out will, broken in the battle.
Alfonso Ulrich is still here.
Of course.
I just couldn't kill him.
Found him!
The dust again?
Aren't you sick of it yet?
It's useless.
Alfonso!
I told you I could find you by smell.
Checkmate.
Are you sure?
Don't forget what kind of people are stubborn.
Even with the Philosopher's Stone, you can't beat us, but I'm not alone.
Where is Henry?
Really?
He used the cloud of dust to determine the direction of the wind?
He's preparing an attack from the winded side so I can't feel him.
Behind you!
It can't be!
How can he move with such wounds?
Dr. Mark!
Dr. Mark!
It's available for free.

Ice cream van?
Yes, don't miss it.
Got it.
Alchemy is a useful thing after all.
Changing the appearance of the van is useless.
All four entrances to the headquarters are blocked.
What are we going to do?
Break through the wall?
No, we'll leave the dirty work to the soldiers.
We'll use the underground passage.
Got it.
We'll split up here.
Take Mrs. Bradley to the designated place.
Yes, sir.
It's lucky I have thick skin!
There.
Go to the place you're supposed to go.
Yes, sir!
I'm lucky to be fat-skinned.
These philosophical stones are just something.
Legs!
Aim at the legs!
What?
Alex!
It's just a light blow.
Are you okay, sister?
It's just a light fracture.
Sister!
I'll kill you quickly and go to sleep.
Stopped.
He didn't attack Kimbley.
But why?
I see.
People are very stubborn.
However, you still can't win.
Until our father stays there.
Although you still need to find a way to escape from me.
Who is it?
I did it!
I did it!
Yoki!
Hold on, man!
I couldn't even think that you'd come here.
I'm tired of you getting all the laurels forever.
I'm tired of you getting all the laurels forever.
I'm tired of you getting all the laurels forever.
Give me a chance to be a hero, damn it!
Did you see that?
With one blow, Yoki defeated the great homunculus number one.
I did it!
Did you get the car?
I gave it to Kimbley.
I had to put the drivers to sleep.
Great job, Dr. Marke.
Press the gas.
Press the gas.
Shut up, steering wheel!
I don't want to continue fighting this monster.
Shut up, steering wheel!
I don't want to continue fighting this monster.
We're going to the capital.
We have to find Ed and deal with this father...
before this creature returns there.
Brave people run away so fast.
You're still alive.
New color of the area.
Now I understand why the lion is called the king of animals.
Obeying the law of survival of the strongest, he clung tightly to your throat.
It seems that people really do not have a place in this world.
You have always claimed that you want to see whose side this world will choose.
It will be a shame for you to die here.
Well, do not worry.
You will continue to exist as part of me.
What was it?
Your mother!
Alex!
When you know in advance what he will do, it is not a problem to put a trap.
Can you get up?
I remembered, they were ordered to shoot me on the spot.
What?
That will not work.
We have not yet prepared the papers on which Armstrong's estate will be transferred to me after your death.
It's no use.
If I die on the spot, I will end up with Mustang.
You decided this even without consulting with your family?
Even he, let him be on the side of Micron, but better such an idiot as you.
How dare you insult a man who saved your life?
What the hell?
Enemies?
But do not say that this is Mustang.
What the hell?
What the hell?
They do not take them!
Are these Brix soldiers?
Idiot!
Do not compare my people with these poor creatures.
It does not look like this Verzil.
They were sent here by the same person who gives you orders.
We have not heard anything about it.
Of course, you think they will tell you such a thing?
What to do?
We can deal with these monsters.
But...
Choose!
Shoot us and let these monsters eat your people alive?
Or help us finish them off?
Think with your head, damn it!
Oh, you!
They again?
Useless!
These are ordinary dolls in which the philosophical characters lived.
They are just like you.
They are just like you.
They are just like you.
Useless!
These are ordinary dolls in which the philosophical characters lived.
They are just like you.
Stop playing catch-up.
The more I swallow them, the stronger I become.
You do not understand.
It will be difficult for me to run if all these dolls attack me.
But when you attack me alone, it's easier than simple.
Useless!
These dolls do not die thanks to the philosophical stone.
So the stone is the secret of immortality?
I can save my clan with it.
I will get the secret of immortality.
They still climb?
They have no end.
I have no more thorns.
And I have nothing more to spit on.
Damn it!
This is shit!
Hey!
As always, I climbed to hell.
Looks like you need help.
A solid metal one.
