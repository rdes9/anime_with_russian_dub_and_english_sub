XEN dragged
Now I'm the head of the Armstrong family.
Sister, I heard you got close to the Supreme Command.
Why?
They're all...
I prefer to judge people by seeing them with my own eyes.
And by looking at them, you decided to send your family abroad.
Why?
Because they're all...
I prefer to judge people by seeing them with my own eyes.
And by looking at them, you decided to send your family abroad.
Why?
Because they're all...
I prefer to judge people by seeing them with my own eyes.
Get out, you loser.
Now everything belongs to me.
Where are you going, girl?
This is the most eastern city in the country.
Next is only the desert.
I'm going back home.
Home?
Yes, to Xing.
Are you going to cross the desert?
Yes.
And aren't you afraid to go through the desert alone?
No.
I'm not afraid to go through the desert alone.
I'm afraid to go through the desert alone.
Hey, people!
You can't let her go like that.
Get her food and equipment.
What?
But...
Don't be stubborn.
Before such a trip, you need to sleep as you should.
You can use our bathroom.
You must be hungry.
You have a free room, Steve.
Let her spend the night with you.
Of course.
My older daughter's room is just free.
You sent her to study in the capital.
She was lucky to have a father.
She was lucky to have a father.
Of course.
We need to feed this kitten.
You must be so hungry.
It seems he doesn't mind eating you.
Don't talk nonsense.
You're a good kitten, aren't you?
See, he says you're very appetizing.
They are such nice people.
You can't let them go, can you?
Well...
You can.
But I doubt you can help someone
by bringing home a living homunculus.
But if you return to the capital,
you'll learn the secret of real immortality.
And then you'll be able to save everyone.
Although...
Don't pay attention to it.
You'd better run to the ksing.
Thank you for your care.
Where are you going?
Back to the capital.
I have unfinished business there.
Naive brat.
As soon as you return to the capital,
victory is mine.
If I manage to get a new stone,
I'll be the same as before.
I'll just get a new stone.

And what is this?
Our old shelter.
So your brother is here?
Yes.
I'm sure of everything.
Al is already here.
Idiot.
There's no one here.
You're a bad old brother.
So we wasted time for nothing.
Link or Grid?
I want to eat.
And this is Link.
You saved my life.
Thank you.
You saved my life.
You saved my life.
You saved my life.
Thank you for the food.
How can you eat so much, Swintus?
These were our last reserves.
These two are with you.
Meet Gorillus-san and I'm Darius Heimkel.
We used to be soldiers,
and now we are nyanches with this capricious child.
And who is he actually?
And how to say?
I am Gamun.
Gamun?
You can't say that to everyone.
He's serious.
It's a long story, but it's true.
By the way, how did you get here?
Grid hooked up with another Gamun.
He flew off the coil,
so I returned the body control.
I was looking for a safe place
near the capital.
So I came here.
Hey, what's wrong with you?
Damn it.
Grid is coming back.
No, no, no, not now.
Calm down, don't give up.
Don't let him in.
Ed, listen.
This guy and his father,
who lives near the capital,
are going to open the gate
when that day comes.
Of course, I don't know much about all this,
but if you go there with your brother,
maybe you'll be able to get your old bodies back.
Stop.
Maybe you're right, but
to open the gate,
you need to pay the entrance fee.
Why did he need to open the gate?
And what does that day mean?
Is it a special date or what?
It's...
Link!
Hey!
Damn it.
Just a little more.
Message.
My message, Renfan.
Did you give it to him?
Message.
Al gave it to her.
Renfan is fine.
I don't know where she is now, but...
Thank God.
Link!
I'm sorry.
I can't do it anymore.
Damn prince.
He's always messing with us.
Grid?
Ah, your own person.
Don't even hope
that this doll won't kill me.
Good luck.
Hey!
Are you just going to let us go?
Eh?
Are you going to let us go?
Eh?
Are you going to let us go?
Eh?
Eh?
You heard him.
I broke up with the other homunculi.
I remembered something
and tried to kill Bradley.
I don't even want to think
about what they'll do
if I come back.
I don't have a way back.
Now I'm...
on my own.
Do you want to join us?
If you have nowhere else to go,
let's go with us.
Let's go.
Join us?
You?
Tumor.
Remember!
This whole world belongs to me.
If you agree to work for me,
I might think about it.
Bye.
I don't understand.
There's so much emptiness inside me
that I feel empty.
I'm so lonely.
Then why don't you join Edo?
It's better to just return my body.
I'll become the new emperor of Xing
and we'll fill this emptiness.
The ruler of the country,
the great king of the world,
the ruler of the country,
the ruler of the country,
the great king of the world,
forget it.
It's not my style.
Remember!
I will rule the world.
The whole world?
Hey, Ling!
Wait!
It's you again.
What else?
And remember, I'm Grid.
Grid, Ling, what's the difference?
I'm already confused.
I'm Gring.
What Gring?
It's your business, Gring.
What?
I agree to work for you.
That means my servants,
that is, these chimeras,
are a bonus to you.
What?
You little piece of shit.
Who did you think you were?
We're not your pets.
The shrimp is salted.
I said goodbye to my pride
on the day I became an army man.
Nothing will change
if I start bragging
to the new master.
Moreover,
I will not allow my feelings
to interfere with getting new opportunities
and information.
Such a chance comes out once in a lifetime.
Stupid.
Do you really allow your emotions
to take the top
and miss such an opportunity?
Lovey-dovey.
Working for me
means being a thug.
Don't you regret it later?
There are much more terrible things
that I have to regret.
What are you talking about?
So it's decided.
The two of you now
also work for me.
Great.
I don't care anymore.
As long as we have something to eat,
we're in the game.
So what kind of chimeras are you?
Gorilla.
Lion.
Cool.
Her earrings are still with me.
It looks like I won't see
Winry and Alla soon.
So that day...
For the sake of the saint,
leave me alone.
As soon as Izumi-san comes back,
I'll let you know.
If you keep coming back here,
all the buyers will run away.
Meat shop Kirti.
Yes.
Oh, it's you.
About that order.
We'll be back.
Just come back
for the purchases next time.
Agreed?
Excuse me.
I have these soldiers again.
Yes.
Alfons Kuhn and Hohenheim-san
asked you to deliver something.
I see.
These are very interesting news.
Yes.
Got it.
So that day...
Hurry up and contact the HQ!
Point P says we're under attack!
What?
A fight again?
We don't know how many people they have.
One!
One?
Repeat!
Report the situation!
Hey!
Point P!
Who are you fighting with?
With the housekeeper!
The mountain patrol is being attacked by a mysterious woman.
It reminds me of that case 20 years ago.
They couldn't handle one enemy.
When Lieutenant General comes back,
she'll finish them off.
Major Miles!
At ease.
And he's boiling in sunglasses.
And he's a big guy with an eroticism.
That's exactly what he wrote.
I've been waiting for you.
Who are you?
A regular housekeeper.
She has a message for you from her.
Can we talk alone?
Yes.
That's Alfons Elric's message.
It's about that day.
That day?
Great!
Great!
It's getting more and more interesting.
Hello, Rebecca-chan!
You're great as always.
And your butt is so elastic.
What are you doing, General Grumman?
Nothing should make you out of balance in a fight.
You're hanging out with Lieutenant Hawkeye, aren't you?
Yo, Liza!
It's been a while, Rebecca.
Did you hear about the recent ruckus in the Briggs Mountains with Drachma?
Because of her, the joint exercises North and East have been postponed until the spring.
This time they'll go to the East, right?
I learned it from the Fuhrer.
First Colonel Mustang, now Fuhrer himself.
Maybe you'll introduce me to a nice girl?
Here's a nice boy for you.
Hayate!
You have such a heartless mistress!
You'll see!
I'll find myself a rich man and go to retirement!
Of course! Good luck!
Oh, yes!
Say hello to the young Lieutenant Hawkeye!
Sure!
See you!
Say hello to the young Lieutenant Hawkeye, will you?
I'm better off. They're going to take me to the Eastern Hospital.
Too bad.
We won't have enough of you.
By the way, I have something for you.
A hotel?
One per day is good.
Thank you!
I just ran out of money.
Well, get well soon.
Thank you!
I just ran out of money.
Well, get well soon.
Thank you!
Oh, yes!
Say hello to Rebecca.
Yes, yes, yes!
Say hello to Colonel if he looks.
Uh-huh.
Say hello to Colonel.
Why are you hiding from her?
They're both watching us.
I don't want to give Bradley a single chance to suspect us.
You're lovely.
Maybe a cigarette, Colonel?
Thank you, I don't smoke.
Come on, take one on the road.
Hmm.
Next spring,
when that day comes,
the North and the East will make their move.
The sequel follows.

The Hunter's Shadow
Even when they are far from each other,
their hearts beat in unison
while they both move forward.
