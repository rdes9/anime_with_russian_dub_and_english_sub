        <pre>I decided to challenge Jolio Comanche himself, the Silver Alchemist, you're a brave man, but...
I wanted to cut off your leg, but I only managed to scratch it slightly.
Scratch it slightly, huh?
Well, I'll show you how to do it.
Now, you're a man, Jolio.
You're a man.
I'm Jolio.
Yes, I'm Jolio.
I'm Jolio.
I'm Jolio.
A little bit of a scratch, huh?
A solid metal alchemist
A little bit of a scratch, huh?
A little bit of a scratch, huh?
What's this?
Oh, you're back, mister!
What's this?
Let me introduce myself.
My name is Mei-chan.
Episode 15.
Apostles of the East.
I was completely lost.
But your master, Yoki-sama, saved me.
Master?
You shouldn't be so grateful.
Get out of here, now!
What's going on?
I'm going to heal your wound.
What the hell?
This is Xing's guidebook.
Xing?
Xing?
That's right.
She walked alone through the eastern desert.
Only a fool could have made such a decision.
I wasn't alone.
My panda was always with me.
You said a panda?
Is that a goat?
Yes, her name is Xiao Mei.
Isn't this Ren Tazhu?
An art that uses the flow of energy of the earth and the dragon's veins.
Your tattoo is based on Ren Tazhu of my country.
My elder brother studied alchemy and Ren Tazhu.
This tattoo is the crown of his research.
Wow, your elder brother must be a wonderful person.
I don't really understand what's going on here, but since you're alive and your wounds have healed,
now we don't mind going to the capital.
Great, I'll pack my things now.
Hey, you were told to get out of here immediately.
We didn't start playing games here.
Me too.
Who just told me stories about immortality?
Nothing like that happens.
But it happens, that's why I came.
Shut up!
There's nothing to do with children, there are adult affairs.
Ren Tazhu can't give eternal youth.
But alchemy...
I'll decide, I have to find this alchemist, who has so many legends about him.
Golden hair and eyes, an indescribable youth in a red cloak.
A genius alchemist with a big heart, who helps people.
Edward Elric Sama.
What are we going to do, sir?
Damn it!
What is it, Black Height?
Can a girl walk alone at such a late hour?
After all, there are such dangerous guys everywhere, like Barry the butcher.
I'm going to kill you!
I'm going to kill you!
I'm going to kill you!
I'm going to kill you!
Barry the butcher!
Hey, what are you doing?
Shit!
How are you going to like it?
Why aren't you scared?
Because I know a man who looks like you.
A man who looks like me?
Not this guy Alphonse by any chance?
Do you know Alphonse Kuhn?
Are you his girlfriend?
Well, sister...
You're so strong!
Philosopher's Stone?
So the fifth lab was cleaning it?
Most likely.
The Supreme Command is also involved in this.
And these guys are Last Envy.
Did you get your body from them?
No, it's the hands of the researchers.
They took my soul from the previous body by force.
If we interrogate these researchers,
maybe we will find out who is behind all these experiments.
It won't work.
They were also released to the raw material for the stone.
No one is left alive.
They were also released to the raw material for the stone.
Does it mean that they don't need to create stones anymore?
And now the last question.
Was it you who killed in the capital a month ago
near the phone booth of a military court officer?
It's the first time I've heard about it.
Did you cut it into pieces?
No.
We just drove by.
I'm Winry-san.
It's impossible to get angry and grumble in such beautiful weather.
Ed, Al!
Why did you suddenly decide to come?
Well, in fact, even Paninja took the blame. Al.
Paninja?
Yes.
She got involved with the theft and now earns a living
by repairing roofs and other high-rise works.
And how are you doing?
Did you manage to find out anything?
Well, nothing specific yet, but ...
Step by step we move forward.
It seems.
Well, thank God.
So, the first aid is provided.
Thank you, Winry.
Now I don't have all the necessary parts,
so while you go with this ...
Of course.
Now I'll just go after them.
So while you can take a walk here.
How nice.
There is nothing here except car armor shops.
Al!
Brother!
What else is there?
Did you decide to pick up another kitten?
Yeah.
Well, now I'm full of strength again.
You saved my life, thank you.
It was very tasty.
Did you say that I would pay for you?
Well, don't worry about such trifles.
Don't you dare say that word!
How touching.
To meet such kindness on a foreign land
my gratitude is immense.
Foreigner?
Are you a foreigner?
Yes?
I came from Xing.
Xing is ...
a huge country in the east?
Yes!
It was not easy to cross the desert.
And why did you go this way?
I wanted to see the ruins of Xerxes.
Xerxes?
I heard there was nothing left of him.
I was looking for something there.
I came to this country for the study of your rentanjutsu.
Rentanjutsu?
Yes!
It seems that in your country it is called alchemy.
In my country it is called rentanjutsu.
And developed as an industry of medicine.
Oh, probably this is what is called mentality.
In our country it is widely used for military affairs.
Now border clashes with Aeroge in the south and Crete in the west do not stop.
And in the north of the Drahma empire only waiting for the moment.
Although now we have a treaty with them about non-aggression.
The only thing that holds the war is the mountains of Briggs.
Our attitude to the wedge to the limit.
It's scary to live here.
The transformation of the country into a militaristic state.
It started, I believe, with the arrival of the power of the Fuehrer King Bradley.
So I want to know more about your rentanjutsu based on medicine.
That's right.
You are an accident.
You are alchemists.
Oh, yes!
I am Edward Ellaric, a state alchemist.
And I am his younger brother, Alphonse Ellaric.
Nice to meet you.
I am Alink Yao, nice to meet you.
So, Link, what is this thing, rentanjutsu?
Teach me.
I can not.
I do not own rentanjutsu.
If you are not an alchemist, then what are you looking for?
Something.
Maybe your guys know about it?
About the Philosopher's Stone.
I really need it.
You know about it, don't you?
No, I hear for the first time.
It seems that you do not agree with something.
Do you really not tell me about it?
Why do you need the Philosopher's Stone?
I want to get immortality.
Sounded for free.
On edap.com
So share the information.
Immortality is a bunch of shit.
Seriously?
With your manner and asking questions.
And do not try to get an answer.
Brother.
You refuse to obey the Lord?
Stop.
This shit what? Some kind of acrobat?
Probably it is the martial arts of Xing.
They are dangerous opponents.
Yes, but you know.
Yes.
Sensei M.M.
Do not compare.
Thank you.
We disappeared.
Hey, honorable, can I have a dessert?
Sure.
Shit!
Shit!
What the fuck?
Philosopher's Stone? Immortality?
They got out, I do not understand where they got into a fight?
What are you thinking?
And you and this narrow-eyed haze.
I got it.
As soon as I called that narrow-eyed haze, this guy ...
Aha.
Oh, Panini, long time no see.
What are you doing here?
Although, everything is clear.
Exactly, Panini, I need your help.
How strange.
I do not feel the ki of life energy inside this armor.
What the hell?
Do you think this girl will help you beat me?
Stupid.
Something wrong?
I see all your blows.
The owner, who has such pathetic servants, should be completely destroyed.
I was right.
When his owner is insulted, this guy just loses his head.
And then ...
Attacks unpredictable and inaccurate.
I think it's time to take a look under this mask.
Girl?
The gun is in the artificial end, and in this country you need to keep your ear sharp.
I will not be surprised if you see something like this for the first time.
Rintenjutsu?
An irreversible circle?
I wonder, how is the brother?
I overdid it.
What to do now?
Link will be angry himself.
Hey, sister!
You're smart enough to use this in the center of the city.
The other could die in my place.
You?
Did you tear off your own hand?
In childhood, I often set traps for rabbits.
And I managed to do it well.
Brother!
Hey, Al!
Hi, what a meeting!
You're a piece of shit!
How dare you!
Wow, you're strong!
Well, do you want to become my vassals and conquer this country?
What are you talking about?
We beat you!
Come on, turn around and back to your ...
And here he is!
You guys have destroyed the whole city!
Pay for the repair!
And for lunch too!
Hey, wait!
This guy with his subordinates should pay for the repair of the food!
I don't speak such a language!
I don't know the language!
Sayonara!
Hey, stop, damn it!
Eh?
Ah! He ran away!
And this too!
They understood us!
I can't restore anything in such a state!
Don't worry, brother, I'll do everything!
Eh?
Don't you need a transformative circle anymore?
It seems so!
I remembered how I saw the truth!
Wait!
Transformation without a circle!
Respect, brother!
Give it to me!
What happened, brother?
We are back!
Oh, what a meeting!
How dare you drink tea here?
How is it?
I'm your friend!
Friend, you say?
Thanks to these two, we are now ...
Be sure, I will punish them, so relax!
The girl's name is Ren Fan!
Old man Fu!
They are members of the clan that many generations serve to my family!
Nice to meet you!
That's how!
You ate at my expense, and now you claim that you have servants and you are important shit!
But I'm still the son of the emperor!
What?
The son of the emperor?
You want to say ...
You are the son of the emperor!
Shouldn't you be surprised?
Oh, sorry, sorry!
It was so unexpected!
Just think that the guy lying in a dusty basement and eating at our expense will turn out to be a prince!
I did not allow him to be familiar with Ling and Sama!
She was here all this time?
Well, this title doesn't mean much!
Let me and the prince, with such princes, be together forever!
The Xing Empire consists of 50 clans.
Each of which is subordinate to the emperor.
The daughter of each leader must marry the emperor and give birth to a child for him.
The current emperor has 24 sons and 19 daughters.
I am the twelfth.
43 children?
That's a lot!
I am the twelfth.
43 children?
It seems that the fight for the throne will not be a joke!
Exactly! Now this is our main problem!
The emperor's health has deteriorated.
And each clan uses all the opportunities to get to the throne.
That's why I promised him eternal life in exchange for the throne.
Exactly!
So tell me!
Everything you know about the Philosopher's Stone!
No!
The Philosopher's Stone is not a tool for political games!
Hey, tell me! I'll turn the mountains for you!
Don't come to me!
I'm home!
I was late! There is a slaughterhouse on the main street!
What the hell is it torn off?
What is it already once?
Idiots!
Why do you have to bow to these scoundrels?
Loss of face is not a high payment.
But to provide the future to the half-million clan Yao,
well, if the requests do not help, we will run to the force.
And where are you going now to break your car armor?
I don't break it on purpose.
Probably we will continue to search the capital.
Are you going to the capital?
I also want to!
Why?
I want to visit the Hughes family.
But Winry, what about your work?
Everything is fine, Winry-chan.
Go calmly and don't worry.
Really?
Thank you, Garfield-san.
Great! Then we go to the capital!
Yes!
The capital is cool!
I told you not to get close to me!
She still tied up after us.
By the way, I still don't know your name, sir.
Do you have a name?
Each scoundrel with pride bears a name given to him by God.
I must have a beautiful name.
I gave up my name.
What?
Come on, live!
Got it!
If I don't have a way back,
I will give up everything that God gave me.
The continuation follows.

Don't cry
In anticipation of meeting with old friends, the rest return to the capital, where they will be sadly awaited, though.
Tima received a new victim.
Next time in a solid metal alchemist.
Episode 16. By the trail of comrades.
What dominates the heart of a man who continues to move forward? Light or darkness?
