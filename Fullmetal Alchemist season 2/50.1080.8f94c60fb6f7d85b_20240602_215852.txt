So this is a fire alchemist?
There were legends about him?
Just don't drag it all to the legend!
Exactly! These paws are no more than special effects!
Huh?
Jazz! Barkhi!
Shit! My ears!
Our losses!
Five wounded, no killed!
Not a single dead!
So lucky! Stop!
Well, the eyes of the falcon are watching over the heroes and thugs!
And we have not a single dead!
Really?
No doubt! They...
They hold back!
Yes, sir!
We have a lot of wounded and not a single dead!
Even the wounds of those who were shot by the sniper are immortal!
The sons of bitches!
Send there the units of Dmitry and Kim!
I want all the subordinates of the Mustang to lie on my table!
They still haven't intercepted the Mustang?
What is General-Major Klemen doing there?
I heard they managed to break all our troops without killing a single soldier!
I don't think they'll be able to do this trick for a long time!
Colonel Mustang is too soft-hearted!
Indeed!
What is he thinking about?
But it's a pity that this central army is unable to stop him!
You don't care that the children who are playing in the war...
What?
I heard that not so long ago, only one executioner was able to put the capital into chaos!
Since the day of its foundation, the city has never been attacked by a serious enemy!
It is the lack of experience that makes your army helpless!
The capital's soldiers know how to attack, but their defense is weak!
Perhaps they need a leader like me now?
Don't forget, Armstrong!
For what do you think you deserve to be here?
You are our hostage, baby!
We know how strong your ties with the Briggs soldiers are!
As long as you are here, we have a guarantee that they will behave peacefully!
You didn't understand anything!
I gave them a clear order to act without looking at me!
The strongest survives, and this is the law of Briggs!
If I can't survive here, it means that I was weak and unworthy of them!
And every Briggs soldier understands this!
Don't even try to catch up with my people at the expense of your bosses and subordinates!
A number of colonels of the Mustang entered the battle in the western industrial zone!
A significant group of soldiers is headed there!
Okay, now it's our turn!
I'm already tired of sitting in this basement!
Stab our throats in the throats of cowardly capitals!
Here they are!
The soldiers are able to overcome the Briggs bears with bare hands!
I wonder if your precious dolls will be able to resist them?
Damn it!
New rebel forces?
It can't be! Where did they come from?
They appeared in the city from nowhere!
Are they magicians?
Go there!
How many of them?
I don't know, but judging by the equipment, they are from the north!
Briggs?
In the place of Armstrong?
Yes!
We hid people and weapons there during the riot with the repair of the mansion!
What kind of chrome have they crushed?
Charlie, bullets!
I also ran out!
Damn it!
Has the support group not yet come?
Did they really grab them?
When it gets really hot, don't think about me, save yourself!
Are you sure?
I thought you would say no, we will stay with you until the end!
Yes, Shenzhou with a man is nothing!
Kemmy-san is waiting for me at home!
Oh, that's how!
They stopped firing!
They must have run out of bullets!
Great, it's time to finish them!
Hello, Lisa!
You're late, Sherebek!
Sorry for making you wait, but...
I brought you a hotel!
Great!
There's an arsenal here!
You're great, Sherebek, I love you!
Go away!
I'm not interested in the poor!
This is for you!
Thank you!
It's nice to meet you again, Colonel Mustang!
Thank you!
Lieutenant Mariero has returned home and is waiting for your orders!
Why don't they attack us?
We have a fiery alchemist with us!
They are afraid to come closer!
But Colonel doesn't burn the city to the ground either!
Well, I hoped to find a cool guy in the capital,
but here it turns out to be a bunch of cowards!
Oh, shit!
This is a grenade from Khinga with tear gas
and a red pepper for an empty effect!
Wow, did you really bring all this from Khinga?
I don't remember asking you for help.
And where did you get all this weapons from?
Who called you here?
Do you want to talk to him?
Ready!
Here you go.
He's from the top of Khinga.
Colonel in the Armed Forces of the Master Arroyo Mustang says,
let me thank you for...
Why are you so formal?
We seem to be like strangers, Colonel.
For 80 years we have been serving people,
from underwear to armored vehicles.
We will deliver one call to your order at any time.
Havok's popular shop is at your service!
Havok!
So, how are you going to pay?
We'll settle after our victory.

There's a cloud of smoke above the city.
And I think I hear an alarm.
So the colonel and the guys from Brix have started to act.
The capital is now in their real hands.
It's time for us to act too.
Yes.
I have a plan in case he activates his underground circle.
But it's better for us to prevent it.
He's grown up,
but he's still just a bugger.
If we destroy the container, he will die.
And the souls of the people of Xerxes,
engulfed in their abritutes,
will die.
And the souls of the people of Xerxes,
engulfed in their abritutes,
will be freed.
But how are we going to get into his lair?
Let's take advantage of the entrance that Mei found.
He is guarded by a whole group of chemists,
but together we can overcome them.
Stay here and watch them, Heinkel.
I'm sorry I let you down.
Don't apologize.
Try not to get caught by the military, Mark.
Yoki!
You'll stay here too.
Thank God.
Al!
What, brother?
We're going to attack this bearded Khmer.
Be careful.
Yeah.
Don't worry.
The whole town is standing on our ears.
You need to hurry.
Father can reveal the secret of immortality
Yes, I know!
There will be a line of defense here!
Do not let Mustang and Brix soldiers cross it at any cost!
Call your dogs immediately!
Did you not release me from the command of Brix?
Brix?
You do not think that it will go away with you?
I can ask you the same question.
Did you hear what this guy said about his goals and means of their achievements?
Oh yes, we heard about the victims and about the rewards.
We are chosen, we will go to the top of the world and change it.
Death and pain are eternal companions of change.
Why can't you understand this?
You all went too far.
What?
All you can do is sit in your offices and watch the battles.
You cause pain and suffering in order to climb the service stairs.
You also stuck to the rebels!
Surprised?
If everything ends well, I can become a hero.
And not as pathetic and useless as the hero Ishvar!
Stop!
What?
General!
Major Armstrong!
Sergeant Brosch!
Don't you have a day off today?
I saw the smoke and ran here.
What's going on?
Colonel Mustang and his former subordinates took the wife of the Fuhrer hostage.
Are they in town now?
What?
What a son of a bitch!
First he killed Lieutenant Ross, and now the wife of the Fuhrer!
He is a bastard!
Major!
General Lieutenant Armstrong killed Colonel Gardner.
And the gun?
The events are unfolding much faster than we expected.
I'm going to the hospital.
I'm going to the hospital.
I'm going to the hospital.
I'm going to the hospital.
I'm going to the hospital.
What did we expect?
I have to find the young master.
But his aura is hidden by a terrible cat coming from under the ground.
Stop!
It seems that this cat has become even stronger than yesterday.
I'm going to the hospital.
I'm going to the hospital.
I'm going to the hospital.
I'm going to the hospital.
I'm going to the hospital.
I'm going to the hospital.
I'm going to the hospital.

I'm going to the hospital.
No, I'm off!
Who the hell are you?
I'll serving my duty.
Who the hell are you?
Come and get your data.
I'm serving my duty.
Come and get your data!
I'm serving my duty.
Who the hell are you?
We used it with the colonel when we fought with Last.
The entrance is guarded by three soldiers.
It will be too easy.
This is exactly the case when I can use my status.
Watch out!
I am a state alchemist Edward Ellaric.
What, a state alchemist?
Please help me!
I was attacked by a shuram!
This guy is wanted!
Stop!
You are a terrible person.
There is no time to look around.
I am sorry for bothering you.
I remember it was somewhere here.
Here it is.
I think we should split up.
I will go to the right, and you with the shuram to the left.
What?
Why should I go with him?
It will be logical to distribute alchemists in groups.
In addition, if he blocks alchemy,
it will be no use for you, and the shuram will be able to fight further.
Okay, so they are in the same team.
What about the others?
I am a special case, so I can handle it alone.
Although...
A young lady as a bodyguard will not be a problem for me.
As soon as we find this type, we need to destroy it at any cost.
Is that clear?
Are you sure you can handle it together?
Yes, do not worry.
Moreover, we like to stay with old farts,
stay with young girls.
Old pervert.
Okay, let's go.
You have to find your prince, right?
You can go.
What?
But how?
Do not worry about us.
He is very dear to you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Stupid fools!
How long can you fight these mountain gorillas?
For God's sake, stop!
There are still no experiments on the mass revival of the soul!
Shut up!
When are we going to use it if not now?
It was on such a case that all these philosophical stones were created.
Well, wake up and destroy our enemies!
