Alchemy is a science that studies the structure of matter, its destruction and reconstruction. However, it is not omnipotent and does not allow you to create something out of nothing.
In order to get something, it is necessary to replace something equal. This is the principle of equal exchange, the main basis of alchemy.
Transformation of man is the main stage of alchemy. This prohibition is not allowed to violate anyone.
It is still a long life to erase this feeling. I want to do what I left behind.
A solid metal alchemist.
This is the main stage of alchemy.

Well, since we don't want such prosperity,
Well, since we don't want such Fahrenheit,
It doesn't matter where you go.
Kindness is counterproductive,
And that is why I want to become stronger.
Miss me more,
And that's why I don't need such pain.
There, the man who was hunting for state alchemists attacked Edward Elric.
Ed, who had already calmed down with the death of Shram's hand, was saved thanks to the appearance of Colonel Mustang and his subordinates.
Having been on the edge, Ed and Al remembered how precious life was.
They decided to return to their native city, Risenburg, to restore the damaged bodies.
Episode 6. The Path of Hope
Lieutenant Colonel Hughes?
The guys from the Eastern HQ are busy with work right now.
So I'm the only one who came to see you off.
Everything is fine, but...
What the hell, Major?
You need an escort. What can you do in such a state if Shram attacks you?
Just take the Major's name as you should.
Children shouldn't be so locked up. I'm not a child anymore.
By the way, is Al also on this train?
Of course.
I thought he would be bored to go alone.
Where did you put my brother, damn it?
Oh, it's time.
Good luck, guys.
When you get to the capital next time, come visit us.
Episode 6. The Path of Hope
Dr. Marco? Dr. Marco, is that you?
It's me, Alex Louis Armstrong from the capital.
Your friend?
He's a talented alchemist. He used to work in the capital.
He studied the application of alchemy in medicine.
But after the Civil War in Ishwar, he disappeared without a trace.
Major, we're leaving.
I'm sure he knows something about biological transformations.
Have you met this man here?
Wow, you're a good painter.
He can paint portraits and pass on from generation to generation to the Armstrong dynasty.
Oh, it's Dr. Mauro.
Mauro?
We were in a terrible situation.
All our doctors were sent to the front during the Civil War.
I don't know what would have happened to us if it weren't for Dr. Mauro.
He never refuses to help every patient.
We owe it to him.
It seemed to me that I saw a bright flash, and then...
My security was gone.
It looks like it's here.
Hello.
Why did you come here?
Are you here to take me back?
Please calm down, doctor.
I'm not going back there anymore.
Please leave me alone.
No, you got it all wrong. We just...
So you want me to stay silent forever?
No, we don't.
Don't fool me.
I asked you to calm down.
Ouch!
I couldn't even imagine that you were living in a province under an imaginary name.
There were rumors that some secret documents disappeared with you.
I couldn't bear it any longer.
Even if it was an order from the Supreme Command,
I had to follow it to obey him.
And this...
Because of him, so many innocent people died in the civil war in Ishwar.
Because of what I did.
I couldn't even pay the price of my life.
So, in order to at least somehow atone for my sins,
I decided to become a doctor in this city and help people.
Doctor, what did you order to investigate?
Philosopher's Stone.
The research materials and the stone itself.
That's what I took then.
You have a stone?
Here?
It's a liquid, not a stone.
Philosopher's Stone.
A divine stone.
The Great Elixir.
Red Tincture.
The Fifth Element.
It has many names, and it doesn't necessarily have the shape of a stone.
This is just a semi-finished product.
And with time, its power will fade away.
But the war in Ishwar demonstrated its power.
The same stone was found by the founder of Cornell.
Let it be just a semi-finished product.
His power was huge.
And this means that by continuing the research,
we can create real stones.
Marco-san, please show me your records.
Major, who is this boy?
He is a state alchemist.
So now even children?
Do you know how many alchemists
refused their state licenses after the Civil War
because they didn't want to be a living weapon?
And now you!
I know that only a fool could risk such a thing!
But there is no turning back.
I will do everything to achieve my goals.
I see.
So you broke the taboo.
Amazing.
You managed to transform the human soul.
Perhaps you could even get a perfect philosophical stone.
Then...
I can't show you the records.
Why?
Forget about it.
Despite the fact that it may ruin our business?
I said no!
These are devilish researches.
Study them and you will go through all the circles of hell.
I've already been in the water.
No.
Please leave.
I've already been in the water.
Will you leave everything as it is?
Let it be semi-fabricated,
but we can take the stone by force and...
Of course, I want it...
I want it so badly, but...
We can't take away the last hope
from the inhabitants of this city
in order to return our bodies.
Now we know that it is really enough
to create a philosophical stone.
We will find another way.
What about you, Major?
Shouldn't you inform Dr. Mark of the capital?
The man I met today
was an ordinary city doctor named Maura.
Wait!
Mr. Mark?
There is information about where my records are hidden.
Open the envelope if you are not afraid to find out the truth.
Perhaps you will be able to see
the true truth hidden behind the truth.
No.
I've already said a lot.
I will pray that one day
you will return your bodies, boys.
What is written there, brother?
Central State Library, First Corps.
Of course.
The forest is the perfect place to hide a tree.
To look through all the books,
it will take more than one life.
Here is the key to the puzzle, Al.
So, where did you hide, Mark?

Winry!
Winry!
Look who came to us!
Yo, granny!
We're back!
Oh my God!
What happened to you?
Well, a long story.
We need your help again.
This is Major Armstrong.
Pina Kurok Bell.
Damn it, it seems to have become
even lower since I last saw it.
And you probably wanted to say
it has become a little higher.
If it had become, I would have said so.
Come on, repeat after me!
Didn't I ask you to call me
before I applied for a repair?
Winry, don't you want to kill me?
Welcome back!
Uh-huh.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
It broke.
It broke?
The upper-class astro-armor,
from which I worked so much.
Oh, it flew into the attic.
And Al also flew into the attic?
What the hell are you doing there, guys?
All the time I have to
worry about you.
I see.
You want to go back to the capital as soon as possible
to find those records, right?
Yeah, that's why I need you
to fix me as soon as possible.
It seems to you that you will need
not only a new hand, but a new leg.
Wow, did it finally grow a little?
Shut up!
Unlike the leg,
the hand will have to be fixed,
the hand will have to be restored from scratch.
But it will be gone for a whole week.
You underestimate me.
Three days.
For now, you'll get by with the spare one.
Uh-huh.
I'm not used to walking with this leg.
I'll fix yours faster
than you get used to it.
But seriously,
materials, assembly, fitting,
I'm waiting for a sleepless night.
I'm sorry I'm asking for something impossible.
But you want to go back to the capital as soon as possible, right?
We'll do everything we can to help you.
But for that,
we'll take a lot of money from you.
Ready?
Thank you.
By the way, where is Edward Tellerick?
He said he was going to visit his mother's grave.
Major,
what kind of life are these boys leading there?
They didn't write us a single letter.
They are famous alchemists,
famous even in the capital.
Sometimes because of that,
they get into unpleasant stories.
But don't worry.
These boys are very strong.
Indeed.
Well, now I'll be calmer.
These two are your grandchildren,
Pinakadana?
I know.
I've known them since I was born.
Their father was an old friend of mine.
He left his wife and children behind.
I don't even know if he's still alive.
I just thought,
where are Winridon's parents?
They're dead.
At war in Ishvar.
My son and his wife were killed.
They were military doctors.
They were in this war because
there were not enough doctors and...
It was a terrible massacre.
Indeed.
Oh, yes.
It's time to cook dinner.
You seem to eat a lot,
so dinner will require a lot of effort.
Oh, no.
I don't want to cause any inconvenience.
The more people at the table,
the tastier the food will be.
You can sleep on a free couch for patients.
In any case,
this is the only place
where these brothers can stay.
An extra guest won't cause any trouble.
What about their house?
There's no more of it.
They have nowhere to go back to.
They burned down their house
the day it received a state license
and decided to leave the city.
They did it so that
they wouldn't be tempted
to turn away from the chosen path.
We're coming back.
They've been waiting for us.
We're back!
Edward Elric!
The innocent love
has made you resurrect your mother.
The great love has made you
forget about your own life
and return your brother's soul.
The incredible determination
has made you live in a house
full of memories to cut the road back.
Come to my arms.
Put your hands away, it's too much.
Enough!
Come on.
Wow, you're already on your feet.
It's so early in the morning.
I haven't gone to bed yet.
Wow, it's so late,
and you're still working.
One more sleepless night.
What?
Get out!
They said they'd finish in three days.
Hold on a little longer.
I understand.
I just can't sit still
knowing that the secret of the Philosopher's Stone
is in the capital.
I'm sorry for making you wait.
I'm ready.
Ready?
Yes.
One, two, three.
I hate the moment when nerves come together.
But I say goodbye to this pain
as soon as I get the Philosopher's Stone.
It's a pity to lose
such a rich client.
Well,
why would you return your body?
What's so bad about it?
The smell of oil,
the squeak of the bearings,
and these beautiful, perfect ergonomic forms.
How lovely it is!
Auto armor!
Shut up, you mechanic!
Shut up, you alchemist!
Great, everything's ready.
How is it?
Oh, great!
We've increased the content of the chrome,
so now it will be more resistant to rust.
Well, because of this, the strength has decreased,
so don't overdo it.
Hey, who am I talking to?
Al, I'm sorry for making you wait.
Can you fix it right away?
Yeah, there's a trick here.
See this seal?
It connects the soul
with the armor.
So I can't damage it.
Perfect!
It's time to check everything in action.
Wow!
How calm it is here.
The time has come.
We will find Dr. Mark's records in the capital.
Tomorrow we will go by the first train.
Again he sleeps with a naked belly.
Well, actually.
Al, you're like a nanny to him.
It's not easy for me
to have such a brother as him.
How old are you now, guys?
I'm 14,
I'm 14, and my brother is 15.
He's so short,
and he's my accomplice.
And they call him a living weapon.
Now he looks so defenseless.
Thank you very much.
What is this?
For formality?
You are always happy for us,
as if we are family.
I am infinitely grateful to you.
He never admits it,
but he feels the same.
We know.
You don't have to say that.
Grandma, Winry.
Thank you.
Thank you for everything, grandma.
Yeah.
Where is Winry?
She didn't work all night.
Do you want me to wake her up?
It's not worth it.
She will start talking again
about leaving the armor and other nonsense.
Well, see you.
Hey, you.
Come on in for dinner, okay?
Sure.
Just for dinner?
Ed, Al.
Have a nice trip.
Yeah.
To be continued...
The End
The End
The End
Seriously.
This place turns into a battlefield
every time it appears here.
Oh.
Open key.
The key to the Philosopher's Stone
is already nearby.
But the enemy does not sleep
and breaks all their plans.
Now the boys are lost
in the labyrinth,
where one truth hides another.
Next time on Metal Alchemist.
