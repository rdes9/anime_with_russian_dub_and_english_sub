I can't believe that the shelter of the homunculi was right under the central headquarters,
which means that not only the Fuhrer, but also other soldiers are somehow connected with them.
But I have good news for you.
Really? Did you really find my body?
Yes. She told me, you are not my soul, I can't go with you.
I see. So it's still there.
Okay, great.
So.
Now we are one step closer to our goal.
Stop. What is this black and white cat doing here?
And what about her? In fact, her mistress is now ...
What? Is this a painting?
Brother, don't shout like that.
Better put on your panties.
What are you doing?
What are you doing here? Come on, faster!
No!
Episode 29. The resistance of the pigeons.
Oh my God, why did you just bring her here?
I had no choice. She is wounded.
Hey!
Then you will take care of once. Come in.
Once.
Once.
Fuehrer King Bradley?
Colonel?
Something happened?
A lot of things.
Fuehrer was sent to the south.
Foreman Farman to the north.
Lieutenant Brad to the west.
And Senior Lieutenant Hawke was appointed by the Fuehrer's adjutant.
What?
What the hell?
They don't care that they were taken hostage?
Sit down.
Now, in addition to us and the Fuehrer, there is no one in the room.
Because of the weapon, he has only a sword.
So he is sure that he can overcome the mood.
Fuehrer!
When I got to the hospital, you came to visit me.
And it turns out that you only fooled us.
I forbid you to continue the investigation.
Consider that every soldier is your enemy.
That's what I said then.
You are very important to us.
And you have nothing to know.
Sit quietly until the time comes.
And then nothing will happen to you.
When your time comes, what will happen to ordinary people?
With those who are not valuable victims?
Didn't I say that you have nothing to know?
A solid metal alchemist.
A solid metal alchemist means ...
In order to return our bodies, I agreed to wear the climate of an army dog.
But it seems that the entire Institute of State Alchemists serves to select valuable victims.
If you are going to use me for something like that ...
My government service is over.
Dog collar stained with blood.
Whatever you do, I'll put an end to it.
All state alchemists will find out how that girl was called.
I remembered. Winry Rockbell.
She was born in Risenburg.
Your childhood friend and practically a relative.
A talented car mechanic.
Now she works at Rushville.
A real gift for friends and customers.
She is a good, obedient girl.
Try to touch her with your finger.
Or her loved ones.
So what are you going to do?
If you still want to leave the service, you are free.
Here you are, Slavnenko.
Excuse me.
We have a request.
How to say?
Even if we are under surveillance, allow us to continue looking for ways to return our bodies.
Please.
I do not mind.
If you do not do unnecessary.
And what about you, Colonel Mustang?
I do not mind.
And what about you, Colonel Mustang?
You are not going to leave the ranks of our army.
Well.
It is better to stay an army dog than to run away like a cowardly puppy.
I am too open-minded to take off this uniform and refuse this sign.
Just in case, now.
So they decided.
You are free.
May I ask one question, Your Excellency?
May I ask you, Colonel?
Was it Belih Yuzay?
No.
It was not me.
Then who?
The deal was one question.
Excuse me.
Oh yes.
You can Alphonse Kuhn.
Something wrong?
No.
You can go.
It was carried out.
The sword went right over the head.
By the way, Colonel.
The money.
Lend me a little.
What is it suddenly?
Do not be afraid, I will return.
Is that all you have?
It's just a robbery.
Okay.
We have to go.
Hey.
Excuse me, Colonel.
We'll tell you everything later.
What did you find on them?
Damn.
Senior Lieutenant.
Leti ...
Everything is fine, Colonel.
You are so pale.
Who is not pale seeing a muscular man
where there was supposed to be a beautiful girl?
Colonel.
Senior Lieutenant.
Are you okay?
Excuse me.
Senior Lieutenant Hyoukai.
Sir, did you go to the laundry room?
Major Armstrong kindly agreed to replace me.
Thank you, Major.
Well, it's not worth it.
So you didn't run away?
Didn't you tell me never to give up?
Don't tell me later that it would be better if I ran away, Senior Lieutenant.
Do not wait.
Hello, I'm listening.
Ed?
What did you decide to call?
Did you break your car again?
No.
Listen, how are you?
Are you okay?
There was nothing unusual.
Did anyone follow you?
Ed.
What?
Are you scaring me?
What did you say?
You never call, and now it turns out that you are worried about me.
I wonder why?
Probably today will fall, right?
Can you imagine how I ...
Thank you.
I'm glad you called.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Are you sure you're okay?
I see. Bye.
Thank God.
I had to fall in love with her so much to be able to manipulate myself.
Link!
How many times do I have to repeat?
Why did you come?
Your friend asked me to pass this.
Link?
The language of Xing?
What is written here?
No idea.
I wanted you to give this to the girl who is waiting for him.
Renfa ...
Aren't you going to follow us to kill her?
I'm not going to do that.
Besides, it's not in my rules to fight with girls.
I never lie.
See you soon. Thank you for your service.
Wait, Link!
I'm Greed.
Sounded for free from the site anidab.com
Who the hell was that?
Why did he start a civil war that hurt everyone in this country?
Who is there?
Is anyone there?
Are you wounded?
Please come down.
I need to know what's going on outside.
Everything is fine. The supervisor has left.
Besides, I'm a doctor. I look at your wounds.
And it's boiling?
This scar on the forehead.
Are you really a scar?
Who are you?
What are you doing here?
My God!
I'm one of the alchemists who participated in the destruction of Ishvara.
Ishvara!
Everything is fine. Her life is not in danger.
She just needs peace.
How good!
Nothing good!
Bring me another patient.
Now the beds are occupied.
Where should I sleep?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
They arranged a military hospital from my house.
Renfan, you can't get up.
I'm sorry, sir.
Isn't he with you?
Don't worry, he's alive.
He asked to give you this.
Renfan?
It's written.
I got the Philosopher's Stone.
Now our clan.
Exactly!
We need to go back home immediately and tell everyone.
Where is he?
Where is the young master?
Why?
Why are you silent?
What happened to him?
Answer me, Alphonse!
Where is the young master?
How do you like this body, Greed?
Ah, you're one.
I like it.
Did you know that this body belonged to the Prince Xing?
He was thirsty for the power that would help him become an emperor and voluntarily accepted me.
Funny specimen.
We once argued with him about what it means to be a true king.
He said that kings live for the sake of their people.
What if there is no people, and the kings will disappear?
He's a fool.
He lost everything because of his greed.
Shut up!
Don't you dare underestimate people!
That's how he is.
He's just waiting for the opportunity to get his body back.
He's just trying to swallow the monster.
Greed doesn't know the limits of man.
The Fuhrer turned out to be a homunculus.
I thought I was going to fight for the honor of defending the people of our country.
And not I alone, believing in the army, entered its ranks.
And now it turned out that the whole army...
Why don't you leave?
It's not easy for a man like you to be a soldier.
Why do we have to do this?
Bastard, do you even understand where you are?
Damn this coward, call another alchemist here.
In Isharia, I already ran away from the battlefield.
I was sure that the army was doing the wrong thing.
But I was wrong.
I had to fight it, not run away.
Since then, there have been no seconds that I have not regretted that I betrayed my beliefs and principles.
Can I run away now when the army itself has become our battlefield?
What are you going to do now, colonel?
I told the Fuhrer that my honesty will not allow me to leave the army.
And the fact that he has revealed his cards to us means that even if he is defeated, he will remain.
Who controls all this is Zekulis.
And now he is checking me.
It seems they gave me honor.
You are too calm about it.
How can I say?
It was exactly the same during the battle with another homunculus, Last.
When I, the one who people consider a living weapon or a monster, fight a real monster.
I understand that I'm just an ordinary person.
I see.
So, young master, you took the Philosopher's Stone.
I'm sorry.
We couldn't stop him.
You don't have to apologize.
I should only blame myself for not being able to fulfill my duty as a bodyguard.
Young master!
Is he still inside that grid?
Alfons!
I need a new hand!
Immediately!
But it will take time.
Please introduce me to the mini-mechanics of the car armor.
Okay.
I'll try to do it as soon as possible.
But first you need to gain strength.
I'll go ask Dr. Knox for food.
Have you already been able to get up?
You seem to be Mei-chan.
Mei?
What?
What should I expect from the guard dog of the clan Yao?
And you are the heir of the clan Chan?
Exactly. And I am the seventeenth princess of Xing Mei-chan.
And what did you need in this country?
Is there really no death?
I will never let your clan take over.
You won't even be able to find him!
Hey, calm down!
I don't know what's going on here, but let's live together!
Don't meddle in other people's business!
You underestimate me because I'm wounded.
I'll tell you the same thing.
What are you doing here?
What?
The patients should be lying in beds.
Don't meddle in other people's business!
I don't care about your business, you fool!
God, while you are my patients, it doesn't matter what country you are from.
Do you want to turn my whole house upside down?
Haven't you heard about the mysterious and unknown microbes
that appear in the houses of doctors and kill everyone around?
Do you want this?
It's not a house, it's a real dump.
Is there really no one to clean up here?
Look, doctor!
Oh, so that's where she was.
Wait, isn't this photo your family?
This is my ex-wife and son.
What is it?
I can do whatever I want with my things.
Can you have a cup of coffee when you're done?
It's so good that you came.
Just look at this.
I didn't know what to do.
Wait, can I use alchemy again?
Great job!
Now everything is restored.
That's what a real state alchemist means.
High class.
Not that some...
In the morning we asked the local alchemists to help.
But there was little use for them.
They all came so important to themselves,
and when the matter came to light,
they said that alchemy doesn't work.
In the morning...
Alchemist-san.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Can you believe the words of Envy?
That these people were only energy,
not having a body, not a mind.
I don't know.
Not having a body, not a mind.
Take yourself in your hands.
You need to think about the future, not the past.
But then not only me and Al,
but also other alchemists lost their power.
But...
All except for this little girl and Shurama.
How can this be?
Their alchemy is something different from ours.
If I find out her secret,
I will be able to return the body of Al
and fight this bearded chameleon
without a philosophical stone.
I need to return it to the senior lieutenant.
The continuation follows...
The end of the ad.
To be continued...
To be continued...
They made me work for them.
I created philosophical stones
and took the lives of many shwarits.
And now they force me to participate
in an experiment that will take even more lives.
Therefore, I beg you, kill me.
Here and now.
Only death will save me from them.
You appeared to me like God.
I have not yet learned the whole truth about Ishvara.
What have you bastards done there?
Tell me everything, Marko.
Before my right hand destroys you.
Pain and endless violence.
The earth is drowning in blood.
The air is soaked with the smell of burning flesh.
Ishvar.
Memories of the past.
The end.
Ishvar.
Memories that I want to forget.
Next time on Metal Alchemist.
Episode 30.
The destruction of Ishvar.
I will tell the truth, no matter what it is.
