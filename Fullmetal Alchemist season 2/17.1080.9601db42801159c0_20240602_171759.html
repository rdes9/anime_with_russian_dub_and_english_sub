        <pre>White scenery is inviting me now
I'm going to a world I haven't seen yet
A solid metal alchemist
I was lost under a mouse-colored sky
A map of the day changed, many dreams were blurred
Someday, even if I'm small
I wonder if I can go beyond those clouds
Strong and wounded, as if my heart had been pierced
The raindrops that fell repeatedly
A straight light crosses me
Without telling me where to go, I'll go anywhere
I'm going to a world I haven't seen yet
I'm going to a world I haven't seen yet
This bullet was killed by Major General Hughes
.45 caliber, one shot
Shoot from close range, no special skill is needed here
This is for the strength of even women
What caliber is your weapon?
.45
This is your ballistic report, right?
It says here that you used one shot, for what?
How is it written there?
I used it to protect Edward Elric, the fifth research laboratory
But there is no one in the fifth research laboratory, it has long been closed
There were people there
According to your words?
I can order you to find your bullet if it is really there
The fifth research laboratory was blown up for unidentified reasons
Otherwise, you claim that you used weapons in a deserted place
And that your bullet is now under a pile of debris and it is impossible to find it?
There are witnesses who saw you leaving the crime scene at the day and time of the murder
That's ridiculous!
Calm down
What did you do at the time of the murder?
That day I spent in the house of my parents
They can confirm
The testimony of family members or close people cannot be considered as an alibi?
Young Lieutenant Maria Ross is currently on interrogation
I can not let you in, even if you are her boss
I see
Major Armstrong!
Sergeant Brosch!
Are you here too, Major?
Yes, are you here because of Lieutenant Ross?
Yes, to be honest
To be honest, I also used one bullet to protect the Elric brothers, like Lieutenant Ross
What?
I reported about it, but they did not even listen to me
So they want to expose her as a murderer?
Episode 17, indifferent flame
If you look closely, you are so badly scratched
Your path is so difficult, isn't it?
Tell me, what are you going to do?
Hey
I think...
Mom, don't cry
What should I do?
What is it?
You never talk to me about your business
I see
I'm very scared
You are exposed to such dangers, against which even Hyosun did not stand
I go crazy with fear when thinking about it
Because you can die
Disappear from my life
Like mom and dad
I go crazy with fear when thinking about it
To be honest, I want you to leave your search
I also want you to return the bodies
And I don't want you to go on such a dangerous path
Because
But
I'm sorry
I don't understand what I want
You are so cute, Winry
What did you say?
I'm always cute?
Oh, you're disgusting
Wait, are you scratching me now?
Damn, what are you talking about?
Here
Evening newspaper
Oh, finally
What? Newspaper again?
I have to watch you all day
Maybe this is my only joy
Says the warrant officer Farman
I'm calling from the open line
Please connect me to Colonel Mustang
Exactly
My cat
What is it?
Aram, George, Oliver
46-49
What a lady
Philosopher's Stone
People with Urboros's tattoo
Homunculi
How are they?
Brother
Look
Don't scare me like that
It was
Downstairs
What is it?
What?
Young Lieutenant Maria Rose admitted to be guilty of the murder of Major General Hughes?
I don't believe it
Maybe Colonel or Major knows something else?
Tell Winry
I'll explain it to her later
I don't like these things
Stop joking
I'll put a bearded dog on my neck
Oh yes, I'll ask again for loyalty
Are you really 15?
It's true
Stop lying
It's true
What is it?
What is it?
A pilot needs help
What?
You'd better not jump
Yes
Heal, heal, heal
Guys
Guys, try
What's wrong with him?
He doesn't take weapons
Hurry up
Damn
It's so boring
I can't crush anyone
Hello, man
Don't take my weapon
Can you get me out of here?
Who are you?
I'm an illegal skshing
I see
It was a long way
If you get me out, I'll help you
I don't have time for you
I'll help you
I'll help you
I'll help you
I'll help you
I don't have time for you
What country are you talking about?
Skshing, it's in the east
Let's go
Thank you
I'm waiting
Hello, honey
I found you
Are you from the fifth research laboratory?
I'm so glad you remember me
I was thinking about you every time I saw a hole in your bullet
Dear killer Yuzo
It's a misunderstanding
Come on
What about the newspaper?
What about the newspaper?
It's a misunderstanding
Come on
What about the newspaper?
What about the newspaper?
It can't be
It looks like you've already been found guilty
and even sentenced to execution
Are you kidding?
It can't be
Because the investigation...
Choose
To be executed by the military or to run away with me
The third is not allowed
It's a nightmare
Are there any other options?
Look over there
Oh my God
Mom, dad, I'm sorry
Okay, run away
Are you happy?
You better take me with you, you stupid tin
Well done
What's wrong with being a woman?
Women also have eggs
Yes
Yes, I understand
To tell everyone
Maria Ross ran away from prison
She has some kind of terrible accomplice
To detain
In the face of resistance
To shoot in place
How long do we have to run?
Shut up and run
Lieutenant Ross?
Edward Kuhn, Alfons Kuhn
Hey, you're that guy
You're Link?
Ni hao
What are you doing here?
That's what we should ask
There's no time
You
Lady, run down this street
To the city quarter
No one will find you in such a place
Lieutenant Ross, about Lieutenant Colonel Hughes
Hurry up
If the military finds you, they'll shoot you in place
Lieutenant Ross, leave her
Lieutenant
Lieutenant Ross
Maria Ross is dead
What?
Oh, she did it
Hey, stop
Oh, shit
Go away, you musk-eyed
Yes
Link, why are you working with this guy?
We'll talk later
Oh, shit
Oh, shit
Hello, metal target
What does it mean?
What does it all mean, Colonel?
Sounded for free
www.anidap.com
Why?
Colonel Hughes was there
Why, Lieutenant Ross?
Why didn't you tell me at once?
You're attacking the superior
Don't forget
Brother, don't
Let me go
No
This is a fucking mess
Lieutenant Ross just killed
Lieutenant Ross?
What does it mean, Colonel?
There was an order to kill the escaped prisoner Maria Ross
That's it
That's it?
For hiding my apologies from Hughes
The orders are not disputed
And are not discussed
Submission
That's what it means to be a soldier
Colonel Mustang
Try to explain
There was an order to kill the escaped prisoner Maria Ross
She resisted and was killed
I heard Major Hughes was your friend
Yes
He was a good guy
Isn't it your man who helped Lieutenant Ross escape?
Mine?
Why me?
Why?
So that you could personally burn her to the ground
I would be grateful if you would refrain from such guesses
I'm so sorry I didn't tell you
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
I'm so sorry I didn't tell you about Major Hughes's death
Because of me
Don't torture yourself
It's not your fault
You're all here
Dr. Knox
The body is too burned
But according to the undamaged tooth plumb we found out that it was Maria Ross
The barbarism
To turn such a beauty into coal
You must be very angry at her, Mustangs
Well, are you happy that you avenged your friend's death?
I'm just sick of the fact that the hero Ishvara was able to do such a thing with a young girl
Colonel, I can't express how I feel sorry for what my subordinate did
I couldn't even imagine that Lieutenant Ross was capable of murder
She was always honest and diligent
And sensitive
Looks like you're pretty tired, Major
Can I take you on a vacation?
In the East, where I served, it was just wonderful
No urban bustle, and most importantly, a lot of beautiful women
And so our brave Mustang avenged the death of his friend
And everyone lived happily ever after
You checked everything
We just had to calm the colonel down
Calm the colonel down?
Who cares? The dog broke the bait
And it looks like he earned all the common contempt
He's even against his own subordinates
What is it?
Vacation application
At this time of year?
What's wrong?
No, everything's fine, I'll sign
Thank you very much
You're welcome
What's the matter with you? Why did you come out of there?
Do you know what the colonel will do to me if he finds out?
No one noticed how I came back
That's not the problem
You're just a poor soldier in the hands of an angry maniac, so calm down
What?
Hi, how are you?
I'm sending a signal
Signal?
What the hell did you bring with you on the first meeting? Who the hell are you?
Young master, we've been looking for you
Oh, that speed
More guests?
Hey, Elizabeth, how's life?
Thank you for not forgetting
And your terrible assistant won't read this out loud
Everything's fine, she's on vacation now
And that's why I'm calling you so freely
What do you think?
It started as soon as the lieutenant went on vacation
I think she really was his nanny
That's right
I've been working non-stop since I came here
I think it's time to take a vacation
Oh, are you going somewhere?
I'm into fishing lately
Do you want to join the company?
Yes, who's there?
What the hell are you doing, Major?
Edward Elric
Oh no, your car armor broke
Yes, a serious breakdown
We have to fix it urgently
I'll take you to the hospital
Okay
What, what?
We're going to Risenburg?
Oh, look
Alphonse Elric
You're attracting a lot of attention, so you'll stay in the capital
Great, it's time to take care of the tickets
Come on, Edward Elric
Oh, I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
Oh
Major, maybe that's enough
No
It's also an order
Of that man
Yes, I understand
Major Armstrong and Edward Elric got on the train
I see
Now I'm in trouble
I'm in trouble
I found a witness who looks like he's been in prison
That's what he looks like
He's still alive
I'm afraid he might not have a special relationship with the colonel
Who knows
But I think it's very likely
And where did he run off to?
Well, he's still fast and he hides well
In short, you don't know. You're useless.
Shut up, witch. I don't have enough helpers.
Helpers?
That's enough.
Get up, meatball.

The truth is hidden in Xerxes.
The inhabitants left the ruins of the city and disappeared, like the darkness from the boy's soul.
Next time, in a solid metal alchemist.
