Episode 35. The map of the state.
I'll show you the true power of Briggs.
The power of Briggs?
Exactly!
Will you help me, alchemist?
Brother!
You too!
Wait! We...
You were threatened and forced to help.
Do you like it more?
Your nanny?
He is our old friend.
Great! Will you help us too?
Hurry up! Don't miss!
Bacchus, go to the 8th gate!
Yes!
Vitya! We need to push him into the elevator!
I'm tired of this!
Push him! Push him!
A little more!
Turn the tower to the right!
Yes, ma'am!
Miles! Close the door!
Yes, ma'am!
Close the door!
Yes, ma'am!
Close the door!
Miles! Close the door!
Yes, ma'am!
Yes, ma'am! We did it!
Where am I?
Now! Come on!
Done!
And now what?
How are we going to push him out of the gate?
Let's go!
Get out of the way, red shrimp!
Hey, one more shot!
We're out of shells!
Then...
Good boy!
Yes!
Yes, ma'am!
Yes, ma'am!
Yes, ma'am!
Yes!
This fuel is specially designed for the North.
It evaporates even at very low temperatures,
while instantly absorbing the warmth of its body.
In such a storm,
it will freeze to the bones.
It's cold!
My body...
...does not move!
I'm sick of it!
Lie here until spring, you fool!
Buccaneer, take them away!
Yes, ma'am!
What?
W-w-w-wait!
W-w-why?
You helped me!
You were forced to help!
You need everything to look like this!
Moreover, I will not let you go until I find out everything about this monster!
It's cold!
Brick!
Good morning, brother!
That's right!
Hey, how did you sleep?
It used to be better!
They say you saved our comrades!
Thank you!
100 cents!
I thought it was a sign of gratitude!
Um, do you have any news?
The front squad went to explore this tunnel!
But I didn't see anything!
Major Miles is in the hospital!
In the hospital?
He went there to meet a soldier who was wounded with a scar!
A scar in the north?
Oh, there he is!
You woke up already?
Thank you!
Thanks to you, our comrades are alive!
It seems that you have very strong knots!
Soldiers Brick!
What are you doing here?
You have very strong knots!
Soldiers Brick!
This is a single whole!
The one who saved our comrades is also our comrade!
Then why don't you help your comrade?
We have no right!
And the truth is that we are all the same!
The body of the scar was never found at the scene of the incident!
Most likely he is hiding somewhere nearby!
Yes!
We don't have enough of our own problems!
First, this black and white cat, and now look for the scar!
Okay!
Give us the search for the scar!
You need peace!
Wait!
Let your people stay in the country!
Ishwarita, this is my prey!
Unfortunately, soldiers Brick are not those who allow serial killers to roam freely!
In freedom, the strongest survive, and this is the law here!
If you even get yourself into trouble, you will be killed!
Don't even think of getting in our way if you don't want to die!
Garnison Bricks will take care of you!
All the best!
Ishwarita, aren't you tired of surprising me?
Kimbley!
I'm glad you're alive!
Get well soon, Colonel-General Raven!
I found out about this last night and left right away!
I was so worried!
You weren't worried about them, were you?
Great! I'll ask you to continue your work!
But in this state...
A man with medical alchemy came with me!
Moreover, we have stones!
You'll be like a new one, you won't have time to blink!
It looks like it's going to be hard for me to deal with Rintanjutsu.
I still don't understand what this dragon vein term means.
The Earth has its own Aki.
Internal energy!
Simply put, this energy that is born on the tops of the mountains,
descends under the ground and fills it with power.
It can be called the flow of energy that flows throughout the Earth.
If you feel this flow, you know its origin.
You can use it at any point on the planet.
So this energy exists even in the bodies of people?
Yes.
For example, here.
Oh, my legs!
Or here.
But why did the pulse hit your eyes when you pressed on your neck?
Marcus, you need to forget about it!
You can't forget about it!
Marcus, you need to forget about it!
Your flow of energy is too weak.
Now it's clear.
This is how transformation works at a distance.
So alchemists don't use dragon veins?
Yes, we use the Earth's earth's crust movement energy.
The crust is the energy that is extracted from earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.
This power is being used by alchemists of our country.
But... something is wrong.
Disgusting feelings that I have been experiencing since then.
How did I get to this country?
It was especially strong in the catacombs near the capital.
This energy flows under us.
It is much stronger than the movement of the Earth's crust.
It feels like thousands of people are being pulled from everywhere.
It is available for free on the site www.anidap.com
It is huge.
It looks like a whole army will be able to pass through it.
It spreads further and further.
But we have not found any traces of people.
Let the horses down.
Yes!
And bring them here.
Wow!
It is really huge!
How humiliating that we were allowed to do this right under our noses.
Didn't anything like this happen before?
No, since I was here.
But about 20 years ago, in the middle of the winter,
an attack on the mountain patrols began.
Within a month, a strange woman stole provisions and equipment from them.
I spent a whole month in the mountains of Brix.
That's her.
I think that's enough.
Get down.
Now, we can not worry that someone will eavesdrop on us.
Report everything you know.
And this time, really everything.
I can't believe it.
When we fought those monsters,
you answered my question.
Try to understand.
In other words, you asked me to believe in you.
But in that situation, such a negative answer
could lead to your death.
What kind of a secret do you want to keep, even at the cost of your life?
For example, the investment of your life.
I don't know.
Tell the truth.
Please, help us.
The Philosopher's Stone, Gamunculi.
King Bradley.
The so-called father.
The whole top of the mountain was destroyed.
I can't believe it.
I can't believe it.
The so-called father.
The whole top of the mountain was destroyed.
They also have hostages.
Your childhood friend and subordinate colonel Mustang.
We once had a joint training with the eastern headquarters.
I remembered Hawkeye and Hawkeye.
It's a pity to lose such people.
We need to come up with something.
What about colonel Mustang?
Damn it.
If he comes out of the game,
I'll have one less competitor.
The question is, what do we do now?
This tunnel, what do you think about it in alchemy?
This tunnel doesn't come from Drachma at all.
It's just an assumption,
but I think he's drawing a circle along the border of Amestris.
A circle?
In alchemy, a circle is needed to concentrate energy.
Only the equation remains.
Young Lieutenant Farman,
can you list all the major incidents in the history of the country
that ended with the bloodshed?
Bloodshed?
Let me think.
Huh?
July 1558.
Revere's capture.
So Revere...
October 1661.
Cameroon uprising.
February 1799.
Uppmann's rebellion.
It happened in Fiske.
March 1811.
Wellesley's excitement.
October 1835.
The first war in the south.
The battles took place in the north-west of the current southern city.
May 1911.
The second southern war.
The second southern border.
What about the western Pendleton?
In the battles in the neighboring Crete,
many soldiers died there.
And finally, in 1914,
the rebellion in Leoria.
Thousands of casualties.
What?
Rebellion?
But why?
Leoria warned the eastern headquarters
right after they exposed the founder of Cornell.
The central army intervened.
They took command in their own hands,
and the eastern was disbanded.
It was after that that Leoria split into two parts.
Why?
Damn it!
Don't get distracted.
Got it.
Now we'll connect all the points.
What the hell?
It looks exactly like a conversion circle
in the basement of the fifth laboratory.
A circle for creating a philosophical stone?
How many people are they going to sacrifice
using such a huge circle?
Once I asked Envy,
do you use this country to create a philosophical stone?
Then he laughed and said,
Hot!
Think in the right direction!
I told Edward Kuhn,
maybe you'll be able to see the truth
hidden behind the truth.
The truth is that the ingredients
for the philosophical stone are living people.
The existence of those who rule this world
is hidden behind the truth.
The true truth is the creation of a philosophical stone
from all over the country.
But that's not all.
There must be something else.
The secret of immortality that you are looking for.
Perhaps it is described differently
and the path to it is different from the philosophical stone.
With my knowledge of alchemy
and your Vrientenjitsu,
we can decipher these records.
The first case happened in 1558.
It was immediately after the foundation of the mistress.
Even without the declaration of war,
we attacked the neighboring country, Riviera.
Wait a minute!
In all the events recorded on the map,
the army participated.
Whether it was the palace coup or the uprising,
even in Leor,
the situation only got worse
after the appearance of the central army.
They will settle their foundation.
At first we had a small territory,
but we constantly grew,
capturing neighboring countries
to create this circle.
They do not use this country at all for their own purposes,
but on the contrary,
the people created it to reach them.
How practical!
So, Huissan ...
Yes, before he was killed,
he was just looking for information about the stone.
Moreover, he worked in a military court
and it was not difficult for him to know
about all the incidents in which the army was involved.
He understood earlier what was happening in our ...
Do you even know what is happening in this country?
Do you still think that you were able to achieve it
with your own strength?
If you find out what you will understand,
why am I doing this?
I don't like it.
If you look at the map,
the only place where the blood will flow
is in the area of ​​Brix.
You bastards have come up with something to do with my fortress!
General!
You must return immediately!
General-Colonel Raven has arrived from the capital!
They didn't even leave us time to think!
General-Lieutenant!
Only you can do it!
Are you ready to go against General Raven?
I apologize for making you wait,
Colonel-Colonel Raven.
Don't worry.
It's my fault that I came so suddenly.
General Armstrong will be back soon.
Please follow me.
Ah, that's right. My friend has arrived with me.
Major Miles, could you show him the fortress?
Nice to see you again, Major.
Winry's apple pie.
I really want to try it when I get my body back.
But it looks like it's time to get rid of such thoughts.
Don't worry.
You can eat whatever you want.
When we get your body back
and deal with this bearded bum and his ball.
Yes?
I'm sorry.
I have an urgent matter to discuss, Colonel-Lieutenant.
The fortress was attacked.
Attacked?
In the end, we were able to defeat it.
But let me tell you, it was a real monster.
Monster?
No matter how many times we killed it, it didn't die.
That's true.
I suspect it's a new biological weapon of the Drahma.
But the Elric brothers are on the river.
It so happened that the other alchemists
and his brothers are now under my care.
They seem to know something about this monster.
But they refuse to talk.
There will be a big scandal if the state alchemist
who is under the personal command of the Fuhrer
becomes a spy of the Drahma.
So I put him under security.
You're right.
So they didn't say anything?
Yes. They said they came here
to study human transformation.
But it caused me only more suspicions.
Perhaps I should have tried
to make him talk.
But you see, I'm just a woman.
I'm the cause of the pain of a child, so I couldn't.
And this is what our queen with an icy heart says?
So even the impregnable Northern Elric
is experiencing weakness in children?
At my age, it would be time to have
one child or two.
But I missed my chance.
Are you sure you still use popularity, men?
How are you?
I don't want to get old at all.
Old age scares me.
But this is the biological weapon of the Drahma.
He had a wonderful body.
Immortal body.
Isn't that a dream?
The day when this will cease to be a dream is already near.
What if I said so?
Huh?
Lieutenant-General.
Would you like to have an immortal army?
I swore.

Submit to the strong.

then you must be more powerful than him.

Episode 36 family portrait.
What was the decision to go this way?
