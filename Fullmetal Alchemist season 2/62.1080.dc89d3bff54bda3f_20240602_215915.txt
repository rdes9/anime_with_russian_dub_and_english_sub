Que誰 sabe o que eu ve um mandar
22. Nihilistic counterattack
Dad!
He tried to create new philosophical stones
Are people good for something else?
Why do you despise them so much?
Alchemy turns people into philosophical stones from which homunculi are born
What can you create from homunculi? What can you create?
Nothing, you are only capable of destroying
You are not allowed to be a true creator, you are just a shell without a soul
Do you really want to see a miracle?
I've got immortality! I'm still alive!
King Xerxes!
I'm still alive! I'm still alive!
I'm still alive!
I'm still alive!
I'm still alive!
I'm still alive!
Body! I've got a body again! Finally!
Enough! Stop it!
These are not people!
Look! I've got a body again!
Huenheim! All of them!
Damn you!
No!
What the hell is going on?
Damn!
Grit!
Goryus! Are you all right?
Of course! I'm with you!
I think you won't be disturbed by the smart guys
By the way, what's going on here?
The main homunculi, father, has finally fallen from the cattle
Everyone who can't fight, let them stay here!
Horses and two girls, get out!
You are wounded, aren't you?
What else? I won't leave my people!
No one asks you! Get out of here!
Get down from the sky to the ground!
Don't you dare! General!
We are being called by the command center!
The command center is in touch!
What's going on on the surface?
General!
The central headquarters is destroyed!
Half of the building is down!
What?
We can't get in touch with the northern gates!
This is the power of the father!
What kind of monster is he?
He doesn't look like an ordinary person
But inside him is a philosophical stone and hundreds of thousands of showers
The energy of which gives him the power of the Lord God!
You alchemists must understand what it means!
A philosophical stone!
Ordinary people have nothing to do there!
My soldiers are still fighting on the surface!
I won't leave them!
General, this is the command center again!
What else?
Don't worry about us, ma'am
Have you really forgotten that the soldiers of the BRICS remain a single unit, even without their commander?
Weaponry, yellow and red!
Have you really forgotten that the soldiers of the BRICS remain a single unit, even without their commander?
Weaponry, yellow and red!
West gate, blue unit!
You're seriously wounded, Lieutenant General
Please, you need to rest
Alex!
Take the radio!
And shake all the shit out of it!
Yes, sir!
Well, let's go, Lieutenant
Hey, I think I said that the wounded will stay here!
I'm going to burn his philosophical stone
And for this I need the help of the lieutenant
Bad with him, let's go!
I am obliged to protect the young lord!
Look after Izumi
Well, let's go!
Let's go!
That's where you met your destiny
Did you finish him?
He was already dead when he appeared here
The one who did this to him helped me a lot
Together with the Ksing soldier, Captain Buccaneer was able to deliver the last blow and mortally wounded Bradley
You see, Bradley, I told you that I raised good soldiers
Thank God, you're alive
Xiao, you're alive!
Thank God!
Alphonse Sama!
May, thank God!
You're alive!
Alphonse Sama, your body!
Alphonse Sama!
You protected me with your own hands!
Alphonse Sama!
You protected me with your own body!
Alphonse Sama!
Alphonse Sama!
Alphonse Sama!
Alphonse!
Alphonse!
Alphonse!
I'm fine
Alphonse Sama protected me with his own hands
Alphonse!
Hey, wake up!
To begin with, these two souls
Don't you dare!
Aim at the blond man with long hair!
Don't confuse him with a solid metal alchemist!
Blue squad to the east gates!
White squad, your position in the western tower!
Understood
Sensei!
Fire!
There Mihojosh!
Tiara!
Solid metal, how are you?
This bastard needs something more powerful!
Come on!
Don't stop the fire!
Damn it, all our attacks are useless. I understand you, connect me with them.
What? Repeat! Stop the fire! Everyone to the ground!

Hit? Almost. Aim at 5 degrees to the right.
It is difficult to calculate the power of the flame without seeing the enemy. Just burn on the whole coil.
He is 50, no, 53 meters from us. How uncomfortable to clap every time before transformation.
Counterattack right on the course. Great! I like this clapping alchemy.
Fire, fire! Do not stop the fire! Do not let him have the opportunity to counterattack. It is necessary that he constantly uses his stone.
Awesome! If I get this power, the whole world will belong to me! Listen, Greed. So this is what you meant when you said that you would rule the world?
Yes! When I have the power of the Lord in my hands, I will be able to get everything! Only then I will fill the void inside me!
Only this will quench the thirst that torments me from birth! I feel sorry for you, Greed. You did not understand what you really want.
I'm Greed, I'm greedy! I always get what I want! Let's bake it!
Even this did not work! We need to somehow break through his defense! We run out of shells, prepare ammunition! Useless!
You, pathetic people, will not hurt me! And what about the homunculus?
You are in time, Greed, as you like your good son! I just need a Philosopher's Stone! Your will suit me!
Got you! I knew you would take off your shield to swallow my Philosopher's Stone! Ready to argue, you could not imagine that your divine power can also be taken away!
The whole world will be mine!
Greed!
I will not give up!
Did you put the block with your hand?
He's at the limit!
He can no longer hold his god!
Stone! Stone! Philosopher's Stone!
Run, Edward! Brother, run! Brother!
Stop!
No, do not dare! Do not dare to touch! Brother!
May, help me! Brother gave up his hand to return my soul from the gates of truth! And then you can change them back!
Alphonse, just make a transformative circle!
Okay, but then you have no time to argue! Please! Only you can help me!
Stone! Man! Give me! Edward! Your energy!
What are you doing? Stop it, Alph! Alph! You can do it, brother! Do not dare!
Are you ready now? Yes! Now everything is in the hands of the brother!
I see the soul is with you again! Do you think he will come back for you? I know he will come back!
I can not wait to see what he will pay for the entrance!
What a fool!
It turns out! He can! He definitely can! Come on, man!
Ess! Give him an ass! Kill him!
Edward-kun! Edward Elric! come on!
Grit!
Now you understand! You did not need this power at all! Edward-san!
Edward! Come on!
Come on, aim for a metal one!
Yeah, you're right.
All this time I just wanted...
...to have friends like them.
Get up, you bag of shit!
I'll show you the real power!
