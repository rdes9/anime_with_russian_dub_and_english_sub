So you were able to see it and come back alive.
It's nice to have such a gifted student.
But I...
But there's a limit to everything.
You're not my students anymore.
Sensei!
Al!
The trains are still running.
Go home.
Thank you for everything.
Life is still a long way to erase these feelings.
I want to try doing what I've been doing.
Metal Alchemist
I should have been chasing my dream.
What kind of cold winter is this?
What kind of winter is this?
It's such good weather now.
You're not alone today.
It's hard for me to live all day in the same place.
I want to spit it out more honestly
I want to escape from something
I want to scream that I'm alive
To make the reality come true
I can hear it now
I can't do it without you
There is no place to go back
I'm always in love with kindness
So I want to be strong
It makes me nostalgic
It has nothing to do with pain
Episode 13
You will be in our territory
Come visit
But we...
You're a fool!
From this moment on
You are not a teacher or a student
So you can talk to her
On equal terms
What are you thinking about?
Damn you!
Al, do you remember why we came to Dublis?
Zyksan, we're coming back!
Make sure you don't get killed there
Sensei!
Who let you come back?
And what the hell is Sensei?
You're not my students
Get out of here!
Sensei, we came here to find out
How to get our old bodies back
We can't come back empty-handed
Get out of here!
No!
Stupid
So you didn't see the signal
Yes, I have no idea what it is
Maybe you just lost your memory because of the shock
You should try to get your memories back
You lost your body
It can't be that you didn't see it
Exactly!
I and Sensei only took parts of the body
But paying such a fee
You should have gotten really close
So in my memories
Maybe there is something that will bring back our old bodies
But if you remember this
Yeah
What? Is it dangerous?
Dangerous? No
It's rather terrible
It's really terrible
You can go crazy
If the brain can't stand it, you'll become disabled
Let it be so
If this is our only key
I'm ready to take a risk
Okay
I'll ask one of my friends
How to get your memory back
But first let's have a snack
Let's go
It can't be a mistake
It's a boy with an attached soul
The headquarters of the Eastern Army
You're moving to the capital next week
Yes
I'll miss you
You're a pretty busy man
What's wrong with you?
I can't compare to you in my youth
You worked hard
And made life easier for the old man
I'm very proud of the trust you gave me
Mat
No
I still won
It was my farewell gift
General
In addition to this gift
Let me ask you something else
Sergeant Kain Fury
Sergeant Vato Farman
Lieutenant Hyman's Bread
Lieutenant John Havok
Senior Lieutenant Liz Hawke
You five are going to the capital with me
No excuses
Are you with me?
Colonel
There is one problem
I recently had a girlfriend
Leave her
Heartless
Again for your own
Your wounds have not healed yet
Holy Father
How lucky that you are alive
I heard that you kill
State alchemists
I understand that you feel
Yes
State alchemists
Destroyed our country
But
The revenge generates only
The Polish thirst for revenge
Someone must be able
Tear these chains of hatred
Calm down with the past
Sorry for the trouble
Oh, is he really here?
This is a scab with a scar in the form of a cross
As agreed
The reward will be shared equally, Yuki-san
Where did Yuki-san go?
What the hell?
What did you do?
When you had nowhere to go, we took you as a relative
Shut up
And I don't want to have anything in common with you
Dirty scum
I'll go up again
Higher, higher
And then this despicable Edward Ellarik
Will not answer me for everything
And now you two take care of him
You may have troubles
If I stay
Hey, we're not done yet
Son of a bitch, what did you do to him?
I'll give you time to pray to God
What God?
Not yet
Wait, don't come closer
I was wrong
Please spare me
I will serve you until the end of my life
You're leaving
Your older brother would be upset
I have no way back now
Let's see
He is here
We've been waiting for you, baby
We know your secret
Come to the Devil's nest
You are the ones who know my secret.
Yeah, we know a lot of things.
I would like to know my secret myself.
Then everything is simple. Come with me.
But Sensei forbade me to walk with strangers.
How old are you?
Fourteen.
At the age of fourteen, it would be time to think with your own head.
You can't look at the teacher all your life.
That's right. I have to think with my own head.
That's right. So let's go!
I thought with my own head and decided.
Get out of here, guys. It's all shit.
And learn this so-called secret.
If you don't want to be good, we'll be bad.
It's okay if I come in.
Inside me!
Stop whining.
What is it like when your body is controlled from the inside?
Don't try, you won't be able to stop me.
That's true, but if I can slow you down a little ...
I can catch you.
Are you okay?
I hit my head.
We're wasting time.
Who are you?
They are chimeras.
And my subordinates.
Fullmetal Alchemist.
Sounded for free from the site nedop.com
Wow, cool!
It's actually empty.
I'm Grid.
Let's be friends.
But who are you really?
About the chimeras, it was a lie.
Chimeras can't talk.
There is nothing impossible.
My subordinate, who is now inside you.
Chimera, who was crucified with a snake.
This guy is behind me.
Lou, who are you there?
Cow?
Yes.
And two other lizards and an alligator.
And finally a guy with short hair,
whom you met first.
He constantly rubs his leg to get wet.
Nothing like that.
Are you a dog?
Yeah, it's a very comfortable body.
Impossible, this can't be.
But then who managed to make a successful transformation of the chimeras?
The army.
Oh no.
One way or another.
This world has the opposite side,
which is always hidden in the shadows.
By the way, I'm not a chimera.
I'm a homunculus.
Homunculus?
You already know, don't you?
Artistically created people.
And I'm one of them.
Homunculus?
These are artificial people.
But the book says that it's bad to create people.
A lie.
I didn't hear that someone managed to create a homunculus.
Oh my God.
I'll have to show you.
What did you do?
Now one life is less?
Impossible.
You didn't understand?
No, it's not impossible.
Isn't your existence another proof of this?
Who do you only have a soul left?
How did you know?
I know everything that happens on the dark side of this world.
And now let's go back to our sheep.
To live in an immortal body with only one soul.
What is it?
Transform a person's soul and bring it to another object.
Isn't that what they call immortality?
I'm right.
My name is Grid.
Because I'm the most greedy.
I want money.
I want women.
I want power and fame.
Everything in this world belongs to me.
And I want to live forever.
But aren't you immortal?
I was created for fame.
I've been living for almost 200 years.
But that doesn't mean I'm immortal.
So I told you my secret.
Now it's your turn.
Open it.
The secret of this body.
It's better to tell you everything.
You don't want to be disassembled into pieces and studied like a laboratory rat.
I can't.
I don't remember how I got this body.
The transformation of my soul was made by another person.
So I don't know anything.
What if it was made by another person?
I'll talk to him.
Of course.
And where did Al go?
I'll tell you.
If you tell us the secret of your brother.
Brother?
Just don't tell me they kidnapped you.
Brother, this guy is a homunculus.
Homunculus?
Hey, don't open all our cards at once.
They might know how to return our old bodies.
Uroboros's tattoo.
Exactly.
It would be much easier if we decided everything only with a boy in armor.
If you're with those guys, tell me.
Those guys?
In the laboratory, there were guys with the same tattoos.
And we also met people there whose souls were also attached to the armor.
Really?
Well, these guys have a separate story.
I have nothing to do with them.
Now let's talk about business.
You two want to return your old bodies, right?
I will teach you how to create homunculi.
For this, you will tell me about the transformation of the soul.
What do you say?
Though you need to restore your old body.
Don't you think it's much more convenient?
No!
Why?
You don't feel hungry, you don't feel tired, you never need to sleep.
Are you kidding me?
Convenient?
What are you talking about?
Stop messing with me, monkey!
Listen to me!
You are a self-loved son of a bitch!
Did you want to know about the transformation of the soul?
Fuck you, not the soul!
Do you think I'm afraid of you?
Are you going to spit on my blood?
I'll break it into pieces!
I will drink all your secrets with these hands!
Equal exchange, you say?
Forget about the exchange!
You scoundrel, you don't see fair deals!
So you don't understand either, do you?
Don't kill him!
I won't, I won't!
You are slower than one of my familiar mortals!
Next!
Lo, take care of our guest in armor.
Cut him into pieces and study everything.
Got it!
Hey, hey, hey!
What are you doing?
Hey, hey, hey!
Stop!
Hey, hey, hey!
Your steel won't even scratch this shield!
Well, how do you like it with a broken head?
If I were an ordinary person, I would have been lying in the hospital for a long time.
But you are not an ordinary person.
Oh, my body is not ordinary.
The abilities of regeneration are just great.
And I also have an absolute shield.
Well, bro?
You can't handle me?
Maybe now let's talk about business?
You are not so simple.
You do not pay attention to all these wounds on the body.
But when your feelings are hurt, you lose self-control.
It's just funny.
Are you really ready to miss the chance to find out the truth and lose your brother, giving up your anger?
After I finish with you, I will go after my brother.
Your regeneration is not endless.
If I continue to attack parts of your body made of flesh and blood ...
I'm sorry I underestimated you at first.
I completely forgot to mention this.
I do not like to show off to people in such a terrible form.
I told you, huh?
You can't even scratch me.
I found it in the western alley.
Al disappeared.
And now Ed.
Here are the fools.
I will make them my students again.
And then I will teach them the mind.
It's time to put their brains in place.
Found!
Recently we saw how a boy like Ed entered the devil's nest.
You didn't die for an hour?
Great, let's continue.
Children should be active.
No matter how many times you do it, you will not win.
Maybe you'll tell your secret?
Thank you.
Now that the blood has come out of my head, my thoughts have become clear.
What should I expect from my mechanic?
Even in such a state, the hand is still moving.
Will you continue to resist?
Then lie down.
The shield is strong again.
Strange.
And now what?
The same trick again?
What did you do with my shield?
If you think a little, then everything is simple.
Let you be a homunculus, but you have a human body, and it is a third of carbon.
And carbon, depending on molecular connections, can be soft like graphite and hard like diamond.
If you understand this, alchemy will complete the rest.
Great. Otherwise, it would not be interesting.
And now I understood one more thing.
What?
And now I understood one more thing.
Confirmation and regeneration cannot happen at the same time?
I thought you were just a stupid psycho.
But how much more can you hold out in such a state?
I'm sorry for the intrusion.
Sensei!
Stupid!
You're not even able to take care of the broom.
I'm sorry.
It seems you did a good job of my boys.
Sensei, this guy ...
I know. Your screams were heard even from the corridor.
Hey, wait a second.
I'm not fighting, girl.
Damn you!
The usual.
Housewife!
Housewife!

Even the world of this is bent under even more force.
But the spirit cannot be broken!
Until there is dignity.
Next time on a metal alchemist's goal.
Episode 14. The one who hides underground.
What you see is not all.
