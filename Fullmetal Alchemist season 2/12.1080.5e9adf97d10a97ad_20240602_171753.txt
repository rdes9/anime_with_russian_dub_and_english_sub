To erase this feeling, life is still long, isn't it?
I want to try to do what I left behind.
The goal of a metal alchemist
I should have been chasing the continuation of my dream
I'm going down a narrow road, and I'm stepping on a person
I don't want to go back to the way I was then
I'm looking for the sky that I lost
I don't want to see a sad face like a sacrifice, so that you understand
The next and the last are not tears, I carry it painfully
Who is waiting for an invisible emotion in the color of my eyes?
I want to spit it out more honestly, as if it were a white note
What do you want to escape from?
I want to scream that I'm alive so that the reality doesn't come true
Can you hear me?
I can't do it without love
There is no place to go back to
I'm always in love with kindness, so I want to be strong
It makes me nostalgic
This pain has nothing to do with anything
Episode 12
One thing is everything, and everything is one
Brother, we are already approaching Douglas
Did you have a dream?
Yes, it's him again
Finally we got there
Yeah
I wish Sensei was not at home
Wow
Hello, we haven't seen each other for a long time
Welcome, I see you have grown
Are you going to flatten me like that?
This is me, Alphonse, nice to meet you
You really have grown
I was first patted on the head since I became an armor
The Elric's Karate Shiki came from the sea
Can you stand up?
I'm fine, today I feel good
I doubt she would be lying in bed if she was fine
So her body has not recovered
How do you understand this, idiot?
Did you really become an army dog?
Sensei, what about this?
Alph, you have grown so much
You haven't changed at all, Sensei
You haven't changed at all, Sensei
Did you stop training at all?
Yes
I thought you didn't feel well
What did you say?
I got up from the bed only because I heard that you were here
You can't do this
You were worried about me, my dear
I don't know much about the Philosopher's Stone
I'm not interested in it
I see
Do you remember the alchemist we met in the capital?
He seemed to know a lot about the Stone
What did he look like?
I think his name was Hohenheim
What's wrong with you?
He's still alive
Do you know him?
He's our father
Who left you then?
That bastard
It's because of him that my mother died
Because of him
What happened?
You got up so early today
Al said he wanted to pee
You care so much about your brother
Thank you, Ed
Mom, where's dad?
He's gone
When will he come back?
He won't come back
Finish eating
Mom
Mom
Mom
Mom
Mom
Did dad say anything about the Stone?
He looked happy and said
that his long dream would soon come true
What's this?
It's time for dinner
Let's go
Don't you want to eat, Al?
No, I ate on the train
By the way, Al, how did we see the baby born in Rushville?
That's right
Sensei, we helped the baby to be born
What kind of help is that?
Now I understand that the whole family must make an effort
to give birth to a healthy child
And the mother even risks her own life
That's why a new person gets blessing from everyone
That's right
The two of them were born in the same way
That's why they must value their lives
Brother
Sensei hasn't changed a bit, has he?
No
She's the same as she was when we first met
Throw your bags here
Bring more
Move
The dam will blow up now
Everyone, run upstairs
Brother, look
Hey, it's dangerous
There's a spring
Wait a bit
Who are you?
The owner who was passing
Please, take us as your students, granny!
Please, granny!
I didn't hear you.
Come on, repeat!
A-a correction!
Take us as your students, sister!
No.
Why?
I don't take students.
Moreover, we are traveling now.
Well, please, take us as your students!
Well, you are stuck.
Will your parents agree?
Well, you know, they are orphans.
It seems I have no choice.
You are the only one who can help me.
Your task is to survive.
What?
This is a test.
If you can handle it, we will start real training.
And during the test, you are forbidden to use alchemy.
What?
One has everything.
And everything is one.
I give you a month to find the answer.
If you can't, I'll send you back to Rosenburg.
See you soon.
What?
What the hell?
I want to eat.
I want to sleep on the bed.
I don't care.
Training has alchemy.
I want to eat.
I want to eat.
It is available for free.

I hope these children are all right.
They say that their own experience is irreplaceable.
This is the best way to beat the spirit that alchemy needs.
If they don't learn anything,
then they have already reached the end.
I hope they will learn something.
I hope they will learn something.
They have already reached their limit.
Their training is just a waste of time.
Their training is just a waste of time.
Now I am more worried about their lives.
Now I am more worried about their lives.
During training,
I was left in the mountains of Brix for a month.

Don't compare yourself to ordinary people.
Don't compare yourself to ordinary people.
But this island is full of food.
They will survive.
It worked!
It worked!
And how are we going to eat it?
And how are we going to eat it?
Let's cut it.
Let's cut it.
I don't want to.
Let's do it ourselves, brother.
I caught it, and you will kill it.
You always do all the dirty work on me.
You always do all the dirty work on me.
Come back!
Fox!
No meat.
No meat. We will catch fish.
No fish. We will catch fish.
And how are we going to catch it?
And how are we going to catch it?
We have no fishing rod, no fishing line, no hook.
We have no food, no fire, no nothing.
We have no food, no fire, no nothing.
Don't whine.
Don't whine.
Don't whine.
God!
Brother!
Brother!
Kislyatina!
I'm alive.
I'm alive.
I'm alive by eating ants.
I'm alive by eating someone's life.
I'm alive.
We are not going to die here.
We are not going to die here.
Forgive us.
We almost did it, brother.
Hooray!
Hooray!
It's the last day.
Hey, brother.
There is one thing, and everything is one.
Did you find the answer?
I've been thinking about it for a long time.
But I didn't understand anything.
I'm not sure.
Do you remember how I ate ants
when we died of hunger?
Did I really eat them?
Yes, you did.
They were so sour.
Then I thought,
if I didn't eat them,
then I would have died
and I would have been eaten by foxes and ants.
And then I would return to the ground
from which the grass will grow,
which the rabbit will eat.
A food chain?
Yes, but that's not all.
It could have been under water.
And after tens of thousands of years
it could have been the top of the mountain.
Is everything interconnected?
Everything is involved in a huge invisible stream.
It can be called the universe
or the world, but
for something so huge
we are nothing more than ants,
a small particle
inside the stream.
We are only a part of a single whole.
But everything exists
thanks to one.
There will be no us, and the stream will disappear.
The time has come.
One is everything, and everything is one.
What is your answer?
Everything is the world.
One is me.
Great!
Now we can start
the real training.
Great!
Meat.
The core of the transformation
is the circle.
The circle shows the nature of the force.
It can be activated
by writing down the formula in the circle.
This is also the manifestation of the force.
You will not know anything
until you try it yourself.
So,
before lunch, let's sort this out.
So,
the circle shows the nature of the force.
It can be activated
by writing down the formula in the circle.
The circle can be activated by writing down the formula in the circle.
But how do you do the transformation?
Just connect your hands, Sensei.
How do you do it without the formula?
In a way, I am the formula.
How did you do it?
You can do it too
if you get the true knowledge.
Sensei also saw the truth.
So,
what did you want to talk to me about?
Well...
I knew it.
Now you can do the transformation
without the formula.
Alfons turned into
an empty armor.
And your arm and leg.
Auto armor.
How did you guess, Sensei?
I understood it during our sparring.
You...
You saw it too, right?
Am I right?
Yes, you are.
Teachers and students
did the same stupid thing.
Sensei!
But if you saw it...
No!
No!
We couldn't have a child
because of this disease.
But when we thought
that we would finally have a baby,
I got sick.
Because of this disease,
the baby couldn't come to life
alive.
That's why
I violated you.
I was punished
for taking part of the internal organs.
What a fool I am!
I should have told you
earlier.
What was I thinking?
No!
It was our own choice.
It's not that bad.
I was thinking
about eating it like my body.
It's a pleasant expectation.
Yes, brother?
Yes, that's right.
You fools!
You don't have to pretend.
Forgive us!
Please!
Forgive us!
Please!
Please!
Forgive us!
The world is driven
by a great force,
the power of an invisible stream.
The study of its flow
is a split and a recreation.
That's what alchemy is.
But it's also life.
Alchemy is based on
bacteria and its recreation,
with the same food chain.
If you eat a rabbit,
your body will chew its meat
and recreate it as energy.
And the rabbit also gets
energy from the grass.
Alchemy is
life itself.
Alchemy is
life itself.
Alchemy is
life itself.
Alchemy is
life itself.
Alchemy is
life itself.
Alchemy is
life itself.
Alchemy is
life itself.
Alchemy is
life itself.
Alchemy is
life itself.
Alchemy is
life itself.
Alchemy is
life itself.
Alchemy is
life itself.
Alchemy is
life itself.
The night of blankness and the morning that should not have come
I knew it all
The sky I saw that day, the bright sky
Hey, I'll remember it someday
Embracing the promise I couldn't keep
The two of us will start walking
One more powerful creature on their way
