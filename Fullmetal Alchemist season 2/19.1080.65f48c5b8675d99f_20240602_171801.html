        <pre>Elizabeth! Hey! Elizabeth!
A solid metal alchemist

Well, I should not talk about this.
But after Barry said,
Colonel tries to reveal military
involved in the history of the fifth laboratory.
5th Research Laboratory
Al
I have to go
I have to find out something about the killer of Yuza-san
Hey, wait, what about the secret of your body?
I'll tell you when I come back
That's it
Well, I'm going
Will you come back?
Yes
I promise
Episode 19, The Death of the Immortal
No more
Can I eat you now?
Shut up
Shut up and get in the way
Lieutenant
Go
The bullets are over, the bullets are over
It's lunch time
Help
Looks like I'm on time
Colonel
Why did you come?
So that it wouldn't happen to us
You could have just gone dry if you didn't interfere
And you still came here?
Are you really a fool?
I'm a fool
Okay, okay, I'm a fool
Who the hell was that?
Colonel, the object is leaving
Sergeant, we're leaving, make sure there are no traces left
Hayate, stay with the sergeant
Yes, sir
Colonel
What?
Thank you
Take care of Ethan later, the work is not finished yet
Yes, sir
Get in
Yes, sir
Is this somehow connected to Yuzan-san?
Do you want to help?
Yes
Don't let him go
I won't let him go
My soul is just trembling
I'll at least get him out of the dungeon
What are we going to do if there are more monsters like that one?
I don't know
What was that?
I let both of them out, but he didn't get his eyebrows done
Did he have a tattoo of a fisherman?
Tattoo?
Yeah, I think so
He had something on his tongue
Maybe it's a homunculus
Watch out, you idiot
Wait, wait, wait, a homunculus?
That doesn't happen in nature
In the south, I met a homunculus named Grid
And he said, there's nothing impossible
There's nothing impossible?
The homunculus has incredible abilities for regeneration
Grid was cut off half of his head, but he recovered in a matter of seconds
I understand, it's hard to believe, but...
We'll have to believe it after the meeting with that fat guy
Don't you want to say that he will survive after I fried him to the coals and threw him off the tower?
Maybe
What the hell?
Is there a circus under the open sky?
My body got here
Ah, the third laboratory
Now I'll have to report it to the superior command
It justifies the whole operation
Let's go
No ears!
No, idiot!
Bad job, colonel
Yeah, you're great on the contrary
What?
Get out of the way!
I have nothing to do with your shenanigans!
Where is my seat?
What?
Leave the building immediately to all personnel
Colonel!
The building is a dangerous criminal
We'll take care of his detention
Security, let them block the exits
Yes, sir!
Damn it, where did he go?
Let's split up
Yes, sir!
It looks like this place has been abandoned for a very long time
Yes, sir!
Let's split up
Yes, sir!
It looks like this place has been abandoned for a very long time
Maybe experiments were carried out here?
If you think so, I think the experiments here have been very unpleasant
My God, what a coincidence!
I can't believe it's you
You know, I was waiting for you
I wanted to see you, Jean
Solaris
What are you doing here?
Hey, Hawa, she has a Roborossa tattoo
I just noticed it myself
I'm sorry I lied
I understand why you behaved
You love big boobs, don't you?
Yes, I love boobs!
Boobs, boobs, boobs!
Yes, I love boobs!
Boobs, boobs, boobs!
You've told her a lot
It's nothing to do with work
Do you know Miles Hughes?
He was handsome and smart
It's a pity I didn't finish him
On your knees
Tell me what you know
You won't make it, people
On your knees
What was I waiting for from the hero Ishvara?
What a merciless
Gamuncul?
My God, look, you've learned the lessons, Jean
I'll show you as a reward
Do you see?
A philosophical stone
If you create a human with a stone instead of a heart
We will become Gamunculs
You're a monster!
How rude
We have feelings and love for our parents
We are also
People
People
You've opened up your secrets to us
Not to leave them alive
Yes, to your misfortune
Too slow
Oh, oh, oh
Now you won't even have a spark
What do we do now?
She'll torture us to death
What a lucky coincidence
If there's a lot of water
I can decompose it into hydrogen and oxygen
Full metal alchemist
Fullmetal alchemist
Damn, just look at it
This is a gift from my ex
Damn
Colonel, can you find a spark?
No, I don't think so
Just dare to call me a wet match
This lady definitely burned
How do you know?
By the smell
I'm a specialist in the smell of burnt bodies
Experience of a blacksmith?
But you can't forget about her ability to regenerate
Be careful
Havok!
Havok, hold on
It won't help
You can't save him
No!
Useless
You won't kill me for long
I'll save him with this
I'm here
I'm using this to heal him
I'm not a specialist in medical alchemy
But if this stone increases my strength
Is it necessary for a gentleman to grab a woman by the chest?
Your Excellency
Violator
Yes, there's a criminal inside
The one who came in last night
Colonel Mustang went after him
I think I should help him
Shall we go with you too?
No
I can handle it myself
Didn't I tell you?
The Philosopher's Stone is my heart
I'm sorry
Even if you're a candidate for a valuable victim
You'll have to die
Bitch
You can die here, watching your comrade cool down
Lieutenant Havok
Answer me
I forbid you to die before me
Havok
Where have you been, darling?
Just look at how rotten my body is
It's impossible to put a soul in someone else's vessel
If even the soul and the body of different people can't be combined
Then what's the point of talking about a human soul in armor?
Exactly, there's no guarantee that this body will last until the end of our search
Brother
Here you are, Lost Sam
Number 66
Number 66, why are you helping the colonel?
I just thought it was funny
And also
The strongest in the world, I want to grab you
How much trouble is there with you?
And the boy is in armor, and you forgot something
What a nuisance
You'll have to kill two candidates for one night
Two people?
Yes
You and one more
What are you talking about, Lost Sam?
I can't stand it, Havok
Well, Lieutenant
I can send you after your boss
Wait
You said two victims for one night
It can't be
It can't be
You're a scum
No
It's over
It's over
People are really stupid, weak and pathetic creatures
Lieutenant, get up and run
You want to die first?
Yes
So you opened the gate?
What a nuisance
You're not even a candidate, but a real valuable victim
Alifonskun
Run, leave me
No
Run
No
Save yourself
No, I said
Look how people are dying in front of me
I hate it, I'm tired of it
I won't let anyone else die
I'll protect you
Golden words, Alfon Selric
Well, you're on your knees
He used the cream to cut out the spark
And he drew his own blood with the transformers
How can you move with such wounds?
I burned them
But I almost got knocked out a couple of times
Are you saying you're not done yet?
Then I'll keep killing you until you die
Colonel
I lost
What a pity
It's not so bad to die in the hands of a real man
These honest, ruthless eyes
I'm not even a candidate anymore
What a nuisance
I'm tired of it
I'm tired of it
I'm tired of it
I'm tired of it
I'm tired of it
I'm tired of it
My eyes
I can't wait any longer
But the day these eyes fill with pain will be near
Colonel
You're all right
You'd better worry about yourself
Alphonse, accept my gratitude for the protection of my subordinate.
Forget it, you need a doctor.
Exactly, please, who urgently needs a doctor?
Everything will be fine, everything will be fine.
I'm back.
Balvan, welcome back!
Well?
Well, what should I start with?
It's broken!
Oh, no, I can't fix it!
Oh, I'm a good boy, I survived just fine, but in this state...
Will they be able to fix me?
Wow, you're still alive!
Hey, wait, what are you doing?
Hey, I haven't killed enough yet!
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
No!
This...
This can't be!
Hein-Hein!
Hey, wait!
Hey, wait!
The truth is, his feelings are full of joy and sorrow.
His father stood in front of a long-abandoned past, where vulnerability was hidden by decisiveness.
Next time on Metal Alchemist, Episode 20, Father in front of the grave.
You can cry without tears.
Father in front of the grave.
You can cry without tears.
If you're human.
