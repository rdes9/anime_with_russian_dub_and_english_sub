That's... strange.
I'm sure she's gone this way.
Or that way, I guess.
Is it me?
Get lost!
Shut up!
Are you to blame for losing her, you bastard?
No one asked you to follow me.
Well, if it wasn't for us and Shuram, you would have finally flown off the coils!
This lieutenant stopped me. Don't try to put it all the way as if I'm obliged to you.
What?
It hurts, they are noisy. The enemy can hear them.
Shuram, I want to thank you for pulling the colonel out of this haze of hatred.
You probably don't want to listen to gratitude from someone like me, but ...
Just a little more and he would have lost himself forever.
Thank you.
Always welcome.
Episode 55. Old Guard.
Yes, I got it.
Yes, sir.
Hey, enough! Stop the fire!
Attention! Soldiers of the Central Army!
The Central Staff has been taken under control by the Brix soldiers!
We have 13 hostages, including Major-General Klemen!
Damn thugs!
I repeat! The Central Staff has been taken under control by the Brix soldiers!
The Central Army must immediately lay down arms!
Otherwise, General Klemen will be executed!
So this show with the tanks was just so that we wouldn't hear Alchemist making a tunnel?
Exactly!
Repeat, I didn't hear!
What? Is that true?
What happened?
The command post is in the hands of the Brix!
It seems they captured Major-General Klemen!
The command post? Give me the baconir!
Captain!
There are hordes of marionette soldiers everywhere! They have one eye and pale white skin!
It's damn difficult to kill them, and they eat people alive!
Close all four exits from the headquarters and hold them at any cost!
None of these monsters should get out into the city!
They must all be destroyed in the walls of the Central Staff!
Yes, sir!
Damn it! What did this idiot Klemen think?
I will personally lead our troops!
The new command post will be in this office!
The seat of the Fuhrer!
Thanks to this chaos, I will take care of him!
There are more and more of them!
General-Lieutenant, what are these monsters?
The immortal army!
Dolls that have made souls of people!
Soldiers who are not afraid of death!
Sooner or later, you would also share their fate!
He's got it again!
How many times do I have to kill this monster to make it die?
Let's try it again!
I don't want to die!
I don't want to die!
I don't want to die!
I don't want to die!
Envy!
Now!
Major General Armstrong!
Don't come any closer!
We're in his way!
Get out of here!
You're so stubborn!
You have to kill the General's wife!
Come on!
Hold on, guys!
Hurry up and get out of here!
What?
Hurry up!
Come on, Major!
Run away?
You want me to run away from the battlefield again?
I will not be ashamed twice!
No!
Your determination deserves respect!
You're a real man!
My husband, of course, is a million times cooler!
Who are you?
General's wife?
You must be Lieutenant General Armstrong!
Your subordinate Syracuse asked me to help you!
He always gets in the way!
I'm sick of it!
I'm sick of it!
My darling, he's two!
Who is this gentleman?
My husband.
Courage and power have grown a hundredfold!
Courage and power have grown a hundredfold!
Once more!
You should be dead!
It's not getting any better yet.
Am i dying?
I'm dying, what is death?
I think it's dull.
It's boring.
Living was also boring.
Major! Major!
Now only these white creatures are left!
Take care of them!
Yes!
I'm sorry, I need to transfer my spirit.
Of course, we'll take care of the rest.
I don't know who you are and where you came from, but I thank you for your help.
Always welcome!
Thank you!
I'm sure you're a famous martial arts master.
Me?
Well, I'm just an ordinary housewife and an alchemist.
You know the Felric brothers, don't you?
They're my students.
So you're Izumi Curtis?
That's right.
The brothers are here too, aren't they?
Yeah, they should be here.
So, we need to finish this immortal army.
Can you become a sister?
Of course.
Hey, you both need to rest.
Are you seriously injured?
Like us, adults, we can cool down here when there are children fighting nearby.
Children inherit this world, but now we are still in response to it.
Let's show them what an old guard is worth.
If that's the case, we're with you.
Thank you.
You two are worth hundreds of soldiers.
Well, don't count on me.
It looks like I'm one of the valuable victims.
When it gets really dangerous here, I'll run away.
So I don't get caught in his trap.
Sounded for free.
Aren't you glad to see me?
You've become a rare bore.
After all, you used to be joyful and full of feelings.
Greed, greed, laziness, greed, envy, anger, pride.
People call their families mortal sins.
Of course, immoral desires will destroy love,
but these feelings are necessary to understand what it means to be a human.
Why did you deprive yourself of them?
Damn, just a little bit more.
Listen to me.
No.
Stop it.
I'm not a fighter.
Answer me.
Why did you create the homunculus and force yourself to be called a father?
Sitting in your test tube, you were just making fun of the family.
But in fact, you're a father.
You're a father.
But in fact, you've always wanted to have your own family, like people, haven't you?
So?
Where is he?
Can't he leave the circle before it activates him?
I don't want to be a human.
I want to be a perfect being.
I'm taking your philosophical stone.
Did you finally feel something?
What did you do?
I did what you would never have been able to do.
Haven't you figured it out yet?
Together with your feelings, you've lost something important.
Something important?
Something important?
I hope you can easily overcome us.
Bad news.
The wheel got stuck in the pit.
What are you looking at, you bald idiot?
While we're here, the haze will begin.
Don't yell!
It's better to get the car out of this pit.
It's better to get the car out of this pit, Mark.
Heinkel and I can handle it together.
But don't worry, we can handle it.
On the count of three.
One.
Two.
Take this.
Go to the command post and surrender voluntarily.
Yes, sir!
Thank you!
I must admit, these dolls helped us a lot.
They destroyed so many soldiers of the Central Army.
Let's take the position of the Central Gate.
Yes, sir!
Looks like they don't need us.
What's wrong with you?
Why?
You're sick.
You're sick.
You were created to obey our orders.
Did he deceive us?
Don't you dare come any closer!
I can't die like this!
I don't know who you are, but thank you.
Be my bodyguard.
I'll be your reward.
Would you be so kind as to tell us about him?
What a mess.
Continue commanding from here, ma'am.
I never understood how someone could sit in such a conveniently shot-through place.
Let's go.
Yes, sir!
Sister!
Where does this ladder lead?
It looks like it goes deep down.
Did these dolls come out of here?
So the ladder is connected to the tunnel.
Yes.
Yes, sir.
General, Captain Buccaneer has taken over the Central Gate.
Our troops have been given insignificant resistance.
The ladder is also under our control.
We brought a tank there to strengthen the position.
Captain Buccaneer, stand in position.
The gates must remain closed until all artificial soldiers are destroyed.
Understood.
They say the Western Gate.
The site is captured by the white Riggs detachment.
The Northern Gate is in contact.
The site is occupied by the Black detachment.
The Blue detachment.
The Eastern Gate is taken over.
The Yellow detachment.
We have a supply of weapons and ammunition under our control.
Let me congratulate you, General-Lieutenant Armstrong.
Ninety percent of the central headquarters area is under our control.
We have won.
The Colonel is late again.
Hello, everyone.
I was about to leave, and you made such a mess.
I will personally lead the offensive and end this coup.
All units of the Central Army, I order you to act.
King Bradley.
He is still alive.
Where does he come from?
Where does he attack from?
Greetings to the Encourer.
