        <pre>You said the ice alchemist?
Yes, he has already penetrated the capital.
Colonel Mustang, I want you to lead the operation on his arrest.
Yes, sir.
We were lucky that you were in the capital.
I will be more at ease if you do this.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Yes, sir.
We were lucky that you were in the capital.
I will be more at ease if you do this.
By the way, that guy is also here now.
He can also help us.
Did you mean the Fuhrer under that guy?
Yes.
An all-metal alchemist Edward Elric.
Damn it, Colonel, what did he think of himself?
We had already bought tickets to Lior and had to hand them over.
You can't do anything.
Let's deal with this quickly, Al.
Yes, brother.
All-metal alchemist.
All-metal alchemist.
All-metal alchemist.
All-metal alchemist.
All-metal alchemist.
All-metal alchemist.
All-metal alchemist.
All-metal alchemist.
All-metal alchemist.
All-metal alchemist.
All-metal alchemist.
All-metal alchemist.
All-metal alchemist.
All-metal alchemist.
All-metal alchemist.
All-metal alchemist.
All-metal alchemist.
All-metal alchemist.
All-metal alchemist.
All-metal alchemist.
All-metal alchemist.
There he is, he ran there.
Stay, if you don't want to....
The water can boil and turn into ice.
Alchemy?
What are you doing, bastard?
Big business always requires big victims.
This is equal exchange.
What the hell is equal exchange?
Without an educational circle,
do not get distracted.
What?
What the hell?
It was supposed to boil.
Asshole, that was my favorite coat.
Auto armor?
Incredible technique,
working even without an educational circle.
And auto armor instead of right hand.
So you are
An all-metal alchemist, Edward Elric.
Episode 1. All-metal alchemist.
But I was sure it was you.
No, I'm his younger brother, Alphonse.
So it's beans.
Who did you call a pathetic bean?
Who would have thought that an all-metal alchemist
would be such a small child?
Don't you dare call me small!
Brother, I don't think
his last comment is relevant to your height.
Never mind, I won't forgive him.
What did you expect from
an all-metal alchemist Edward Sun?
Thank you for your work.
No, I'm his younger brother, Alphonse Elric.
Great.
Sorry for making you wait, Al.
Now we can go.
You're always in a hurry.
Far!
Brother, he ran away!
Damn it, he got us!
Looks like you underestimated
your all-metal enemy.
Who is he anyway?
That's why I asked you
to listen to me before going there.
But you said you'd split up with him.
Yeah, yeah, I got it.
It was my mistake.
You have to listen to your elders.
Yeah, yeah.
So this man's name is Isaac MacDougall.
When he was a state alchemist,
he was called the Ice Isaac.
Was he?
Yes.
During the campaign to destroy Ishwar,
he served in my detachment.
But after the war,
he left the state service
and joined the rebels.
We must capture him at any cost,
alive or dead.
I won't kill anyone.
As you wish.
The main thing is to fulfill the task.
By the way,
how is your search for ways
to get your body back?
We can think about it.
Leave us for now.
Yo, Roy!
Did you hear that?
You're responsible for the capture
of the ice alchemist,
another porcelain worker.
Or is this your chance
to move to the capital?
That baloon again.
Oh, really?
Should I take the eels?
Well, it's an honor for me
to meet the youngest
state officer in the world.
Lieutenant Colonel Miles Hughes
at your service.
But I'm the younger brother
of Alfonso Alaric.
What?
You want to say
that the whole metal alchemist
is him?
Just dare to call me
a bean.
Just dare.
Hughes!
Oz!
If you have nothing more
to say to us,
you can go.
Oh, yes, of course.
But as soon as I do,
why did you come here?
I'm ready to argue
that you guys
have nowhere to spend the night.
In this case,
you can stay with me.
Well, then,
I'll go.
In this case,
you can stay with me.
This is my wife Gracie
and daughter Alicia.
Alicia-chan!
Dad,
you have a prickly brother.
Really?
And so?
And so?
Look who is our guest today.
These are the Alaric brothers.
Big.
Small.
Alicia-chan,
I'm Edward Alaric,
and this is my younger brother,
Alphonse.
Do you understand?
He is my younger brother.
But why are you smaller
if you are older brother?
Well, well,
they allowed us
to stay here.
Let's have lunch.
My Gracie is preparing
perfectly.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Bon appetit.
Your fingers are getting closer.
It's all just in one.
Eat as much as you want.
Yes.
Alphonse,
you can't eat
while you have these armor, right?
Well,
this is a special training
of alchemy.
Here, Al.
Today I will eat
just the two of us, okay?
Training, training.
Lay down on me.
Central prison.
It's been a long time
since I've been laughed at.
Do you really think
that I will join you?
I am Bagrov Alchemist.
Kimble,
together we can destroy Bradley
and the army that sold him.
You were in Iswari.
And you saw everything
with your own eyes.
The hell
that he set up there
with our own hands.
That's why you killed
these pigs,
senior officers
from his vicinity.
You are mistaken.
I never had
such noble goals
as you have.
I killed them
because I wanted to kill.
That's all.
I'm sorry, Kimble.
I'm really sorry.
Don't sleep.
You'll get cold.
That's unusual.
You can't sleep.
Well, something like that.
Well, let me guess.
You thought
about those two, right?
State alchemists
are those
that people with contempt
call army dogs.
Since childhood
he has had to
carry this burden on himself.
Brother,
aren't you sleeping?
Gracie's pie
was as delicious
as mom's, right?
Yes.
It was really good.
Seriously.
Then I have to add it
to the list of things
that I will eat
after we return
our bodies.
Right.
Be sure to add it.
Brother.
I really want
us to return
our bodies as soon as possible.
Me too.
One more.
One more and Bradley
will go to hell.

We were told
that last night
Isaac went
to the central prison.
We must act
immediately.
Find him
at any cost.
Block the roads
and at least
turn the whole city
upside down.
When you find him
you can shoot
at the defeat.
This is the order
of the Fuhrer.
I personally
lead the operation.
Doctor, come on!
Inform the headquarters.
We have five wounded.
How terrible.
This is an explosion of a couple.
If you suddenly
raise the temperature of the water
it begins to expand
like an explosive wave.
And the body of a person
is made up of 70% of water.
Let's hurry.
We must
stop him as soon as possible.
Ready.
You managed to get away
from my technique
and this is impressive
Isaac, but ...
Isn't this voice
Armstrong?
Exactly!
The mighty hand of the alchemist
Alex Louis Armstrong.
Here you are!
Water under high pressure
will destroy everything
on its way.
This technique is nothing
against my fists.
Major!
Take care!
Water from his flask.
Thank you, Al!
Follow him, brother!
Let's go, Alryki brothers!
Yes!
Long time no see, ice.
Louis Mustang?
No.
Fire alchemist.
It's a pity
that I have to fight
with my former comrade.
Comrades?
I have no comrades.
Those who participated
in the excavation of rubble
are not my comrades.
These are dogs
rotten through the army.
Some light
will not be able
to overcome my water.
So, so, so!
What people?
I broke my head.
What did you forget
in this alley?
I decided to check and bingo!
Don't even hope to run away!
Run away?
I have nothing to do with it.
All these reactions
at the same time
can not be
just don't tell me
what it is.
Philosopher's Stone!
What?
He uses the flag in the air?
Edward Alryk
army dog
state alchemist
Do you know
what's going on
in this country?
No!
Much more important now!
If you find out
that you will understand
what my goals are!
I told you
that I don't know!
Well done, Sal!
Great job!
Brother,
take alchemy from this man!
Hey you!
You found the Philosopher's Stone,
am I right?
What are you talking about?
If you don't want to
tell me
I'll make you strong!
In your opinion,
now is the right time
to talk!
This is the artistic
transformation technique
passed on!
Take care of this, Major!
From generation to generation
of the Armstrong dynasty!
Enjoy my art!
What the?
What are you doing, Major?
No, it's not me!
These walls are made of ice!
Do they connect?
Is it really him?
Is he trying
to take over the whole capital?
No,
the central headquarters!
Should we take a look under the ice?
Major,
Sal and I will stop him,
and you take care
of these transforming circles!
So I have to
destroy them?
I'll do it!
King Bradley,
my ice will become
your grave!
Not so fast!
Don't get in the way!
Hot, hot, hot!
Brother!
It's too late!
Empty armor?
It can't be!
Did you attach
his soul to armor?
You lost your hand,
and your brother
lost his whole body!
I see,
so you guys
broke the taboo!
We have started
the most important invention
of alchemy,
the transformation of man!
Al...
Alphonse!
Damn,
everything should have
been different!
Oh no!
They took him!
Give him back!
He's my brother!
Give him back!
He's my only
little brother!
You...
just made
your first step
on the way to hell!
Give up!
There's no more water
for your equipment!
Have you forgotten
that 70% of water
is made up
of the human body?
Brother!
You have no idea
what kind of man
you are!
You are
the only one
who is
capable of
transforming
the human body!
You have no idea
what kind of secret
this country hides!
Brother!
Brother!
Follow him, Al!
Did he think
he could play with us?
Did it work?
What? Again?
Don't underestimate
my fire!
Damn!
You can be
useful in rainy days!
Bradley!
Get ready
for death!
What a disaster!
Major,
now!
Got it!
FUROR KING BRADLEY
Fueror King Bradley!
Oh,
congratulations!
Did you work well
as an all-metal alchemist?
I see.
Now I can tell
my son
how he saved you.
Are you
cold?
By the way,
I heard you
did a good job.
I just
destroyed the
transformation circle.
Fueror himself
dealt with the criminal.
But Fueror said
that it was your
merit.
Why aren't you
happy?
Receive his words
with gratitude.
How many times
have I already
repeated you?
You have to listen
to me.
We didn't find out
if he had a
Philosopher's Stone
or not.
Yes,
we just have to
wait for the results
of the investigation.
Edward Ellrich!
I heard
that you got
to the hospital
and immediately
rushed here!
I will paint
your gray
hospital diary!
Are my
magnificent
muscles
warming
your heart?
Don't be shy,
you can
touch them!
Stop it!
So,
it means
Isaac is dead.
You were in a hurry.
He could
become
one of the
human victims.
What about
the Philosopher's Stone?
Hmm,
it means
he exhausted
his strength.
Gluttony,
how many times
should I repeat you?
I got it.
Yes.
Ellrich,
everything is under control.
We can
start
at any
moment.
The continuation
follows.
