What the hell is going on?
What happened?
I have no idea.
I heard Colonel Mustang involved in this.
Is that true?
At least that's what they say.
Hey, hurry up, turn on the radio!
Radio Capital!
Radio Capital?
Yeah, that's what's going on there right now!
It's the most boring station!
Turn it on already!
While the military didn't interrupt the broadcast, hurry up!
Radio Capital
Is that true, Madame Bradley?
The Fuhrer's wife?
Yes.
The soldiers of the Central Army tried to kill me.
Episode 53, The Fire of Revenge.
They sent new weapons and were going to shoot?
Yes.
He told me to kill her along with his subordinates.
The Fuhrer is still under inspection at the Eastern HQ, isn't that right?
Yes.
So, during the Fuhrer's absence, the group from the command arranged a coup d'etat?
I don't know.
Is that really the First Lady?
Hey, I recognize her voice, is that really her?
It's strange that your son isn't in the capital right now.
Since it started, I haven't seen him.
What?
It can't be!
Poor thing.
I hope the baby is fine.
Try to calm down, Madame Bradley.
Who's trying to take over the government?
I don't think anyone but Bradley can rule the country.
The main thing is that you're safe now.
I don't know what would happen to me if it weren't Colonel Mustang.
So, Colonel Mustang is trying to prevent a coup d'etat.
Mustang?
Please tell me more about what happened when you were rescued.
Of course.
You never told her that Selim was a homunculus?
When I was sent a gun?
No.
She doesn't even know that her husband is missing.
When I heard the shot, I thought it was the end.
But we didn't have time to tell you.
Yesterday, the train on which the Fuehrer returned to the capital was blown up by someone unknown.
He hasn't been found yet.
Madame Bradley!
Are you okay?
We apologize, but Madame Bradley fainted.
It turns out that the Fuehrer has disappeared without a trace, and the event is taking an unexpected turn.
Colonel Mustang has long suspected that the Supreme Command is playing a double game.
But now, after the train was blown up, and even more so the incident with Madame Bradley,
there are no doubts left.
The Supreme Command is trying to overthrow the Fuehrer.
Idiot!
Stop the meeting immediately!
You will pay a lot if you don't obey.
We can't do anything.
We are held hostage, and we make every step under the scope.
There are too many of them, and we have no chance to fight back.
Call Mustang! Let me talk to him!
What, Colonel?
Don't shoot!
Please, have mercy!
How do you like me?
High class!
Great! Continue the show!
Yes!
We have never had such ratings!
Let us give the floor to one of the subordinates of the colonel who participated in the rescue of Madame Bradley.
Didn't the colonel start the coup?
Let us, those who supported Colonel Mustang, and in the minority, but we inherited the will of the Fuehrer.
This voice!
Therefore, we will fight! We will fight and never retreat!
In the name of justice!
Well, Mustang, you used the disappearance of Bradley in your own interests.
Justice means a good word.
The people will swallow it right away.
Well, you moved.
I didn't expect to hear such a slippery word from you as justice.
This is a good word, and everyone wants justice.
Is that true? The first to talk about it wins.
What does all this mean?
So Mustang and his people have nothing to do with it? Is that true?
Roy Mustang is telling the truth.
We just arrived from the east.
There everyone only talks about the attack on the Fuehrer's train.
Did the capital still not know about this?
The leader of the country disappeared without a trace, they kept it a secret?
So this is really a coup?
But who is behind this?
If the radio station is stormed, and Madame Bradley is killed,
then this is really a matter of the top of the army?
And what happened to Selim?
Maybe he took the hostages?
I hope everything will be fine with him.
What are these idiots doing?
I report.
The enemy is better armed than we expected.
We have nothing to oppose them with firepower.
They couldn't get their arsenal here.
Inform the front line.
Please.
Why don't you get in touch?
Report the situation.
Quickly.
Brix soldiers are using ...
Hello, hey.
What should we do?
They won't be able to hold the position.
Damn them.
We are nothing.
Idiots.
We can think they came here on tanks.
What?
Looks like you need help.
A metal target.
Colonel.
I see you've found new friends.
A scar.
This place is filled with memories, Senior Lieutenant.
I can see the tears running down your cheeks.
How would I like to see them again?
I thought you couldn't stand the water.
It makes you helpless.
Stop talking.
Fight.
Don't point at me.
Got it.
We need to deal with these white things, right?
It's useless, Senior Lieutenant.
They don't take bullets.
Again?
As much as possible.
These are homunculi.
No, they can't recover.
But they don't hurry to die either.
This is the power of the Philosopher's Stone.
This is the power of the Philosopher's Stone.
This is the power of the Philosopher's Stone.
I'm gonna learn this while I'm still alive, metal target.
Stop running, brat!
Judging by how angry he is, I'm moving in the right direction.
Besides, Kii is getting stronger!
That's for sure!
May?
Envy!
And you're here?
Stupid! Why didn't you come home?
It's just...
...me!
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
It's just...
...me!
Okay, don't be angry!
I'm sorry, Mr. Shram!
Oh my God!
That's what I hate about people!
But you did a great job with these dolls!
A solid metal alchemist, a fire alchemist, and Shram!
Oh, come on!
These stupid northern alchemists are here too!
So...
Who should I start with?
So you're Envy?
Sure enough, I'm changing my form.
Oh, so you've already heard about me?
Nice to meet you, Colonel Mustang!
Stop!
And you don't mind anything here, Shram?
There's a state alchemist in front of you, who turned Shuwara into a Lu!
I know!
What?
So you've all made up?
That's not interesting!
Come on, fight, hate!
I love watching you insects kill each other!
I don't have time for your pathetic games!
Pathetic?
Let me ask you one question.
Don't you people enjoy watching others suffer?
Or watching fools fighting in agony?
That's why you're always fighting, isn't it?
I do enjoy watching fools fighting in agony.
Especially when this stupid homunculus is the best.
I answered your question.
Now it's my turn to ask.
Who killed Maysa Hughes?
Answer, homunculus!
Isn't it Maria Rose?
You fried her alive, didn't you?
No.
I know it's not her.
So you've made such an innocent girl?
What an amazing cruelty!
And how did you tell her family?
Did you cry when you asked them for forgiveness?
Or did you get scared and didn't tell them anything?
Stop whining, you idiot!
I'm already getting tired of asking you the same question.
Answer my question, you idiot!
Who killed Fuse?
Congratulations, Colonel Mustang!
You finally caught me!
I doubt that such an imbecile like you could kill Fuse.
Imbecile, you say?
Rather, imbeciles are people like Fuse.
Who wear cheap clothes.
Oh, you got so pale!
What an amazing sight!
Fuse looked the same when I killed him.
He had exactly the same face.
He died when he saw his beloved wife in front of him.
Oh, that was great!
I'm sorry.
You killed Fuse.
That's all I wanted to know.
That's all I wanted to know.
You can't say anything else, Envy.
The first thing I'll do is turn your dirty tongue into ash.

It's all metal.
Leave us.
It's mine.
No problem.
Then we'll go ahead.
Are you allowed to go?
I still owe you a debt.
In that case...
Do you really think I'll let you talk to someone?
It looks like your long tongue is covered in oil.
It burns painfully, Envy.
Senior Lieutenant, you'll definitely make it.
Go, Edward Kuhn.
We'll deal with him.
But...
Go, Edward Elric.
You have more important things to do here.
Okay, let's go, Ed.
Wait!
It's the son of a bitch.
The colonel will deal with him.
This homunculus will soon turn into ashes.
I'm more concerned about something else.
So what?
So all this time you've been tormented by the desire to avenge Fuse.
What a wonderful friendship!
Go back, Lieutenant.
Your loyalty to friendship has touched my heart.
I will fight you with all my might for the reward.
But this body doesn't know pity.
Don't be offended if you turn into minced meat.
What do you feel when your eyeball disappears?
It must be this unimaginable pain.
Son of a bitch!
It's so nice of you to increase my target.
Did you really think you could win if you grow up a little?
Get up, monster.
Recover your body.
I'll make you experience this pain over and over again.
Exactly.
This is the flame that killed Last.
Stop!
Colonel, wait here, Lieutenant.
I'll finish him off with my own hands.
This way. I think it's there.
What a horror!
It's like an artery.
I don't like it here.
My heart is about to break out of my chest.
It's not surprising.
There is an incredibly powerful key concentrated here.
Powerful key?
It's like thousands of people are lurking everywhere.
Do you understand?
Not really.
What I really feel with my whole body is fear.
I hope we won't come across any more enemies here.
Listen, Ram.
About the flame alchemist...
As a man who was cursed, I understand what he feels.
In the end, this flame will burn his soul.
Ram!
Where are you, Envy?
Damn it!
If you don't get out, this whole bunker will blow up.
Yo, Roy.
You're just a man.
This will stop you.
See you!
You burned your best friend without blinking an eye.
He is dead.
He will not return anything.
Your tricks only add fuel to the fire.
Bastard!
Who did you think you were?
Again!
My eyes!
My eyes!
Bastard!
I thought I couldn't set you on fire if you got close to me.
Unfortunately for you, I can attack any target.
Don't underestimate me!
I'm sorry, Colonel, I have to break your order.
No!
He hit me again.
Go!
You've followed my orders, Senior Lieutenant?
Excuse me.
But I couldn't just stand there and wait.
Where is Envy?
I missed him.
This is a real labyrinth.
Stay with me, Lieutenant.
Will you help me here?
Moving on.

From the day of his birth, a person gradually moves forward, gaining new strength and experience, and finally becomes a powerful and powerful personality.
But!
Next time in the metallic alchemist episode 54, on the other side of the flame.
Look into your heart!
