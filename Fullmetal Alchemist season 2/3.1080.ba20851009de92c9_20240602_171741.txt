Alchemy is a science that studies the structure of matter, its disintegration and reconstruction. However, it is not omnipotent and does not allow to create something out of nothing.
To get something, it is necessary to replace it with something equal. This is the principle of equal exchange, the main basis of alchemy.
Transformation of man is the main stage of alchemy. This prohibition is not allowed to violate anyone.
To erase this feeling, life is still long, isn't it? I want to try to do what I left behind.

Children of God, living on this Earth, pray, believe and you will be saved. God, sun, summer, enlightened our way. Are you guys street actors?
Do you think we look like actors?
Isn't it?
I'm full.
Hey, what did you do, guy?
We'll fix him.
I wonder how you're going to fix him?
Just look.
So, let's go!
How do you like that?
Wow! So you can also make miracles?
What are you talking about?
We're alchemists.
I've never seen anything like this in my life.
And I didn't even hear about the Hellric brothers.
Helric?
Yes, I've heard this name before.
A single-metal alchemist Edward Helric.
So you are that famous genius alchemist.
I see.
I see.
So you're a priestess, that's why you were called a single-metal alchemist.
No, it's not me, it's...
What?
Is there really a rat here?
How dare you call me a destroyed bride?
Episode 3.
City of heretics.
Pray and die.
And who is the host of this show?
The founder, Colonel Sama.
He came to our city a few years ago and set us on the path of God.
God gives life to the living and resurrection to the dead.
Proof of this is his miracles.
Resurrection of the dead, right?
Sounds suspicious.
So that's what they were talking about.
What do you think?
No doubt this transformation reaction could only be made by alchemy.
But this completely contradicts the principle of equivalent exchange.
Because of the object, a certain mass can only be created by the object of the same mass.
And he violated the law of conservation of natural substances,
by turning plants into minerals.
Brother, could it be...
Yes, perhaps this is...
Bingo!
God, please hear my prayers.
Please, return him.
Oh, so this is the god Leto?
Are you interested in the church of Leto?
No, unfortunately, I'm a theist.
Well, let's go to the church of Leto.
Let's go to the church of Leto.
Let's go to the church of Leto.
Let's go to the church of Leto.
Let's go to the church of Leto.
This is wrong.
A man must live by faith in God and worship him.
Live for gratitude and hope.
Isn't that wonderful?
If you have faith, you will be able to rise above.
What? Oh, you!
She meant the wrong thing.
Resurrection of the dead.
Do you really believe in this?
Yes.
35 liters of water.
20 kilograms of carbon.
4 liters of miac.
1.5 kilograms of sulfur.
800 grams of phosphorus.
250 grams of salt.
100 grams of sel.
And a little bit of other elements.
These are the main components of which the body of an adult person consists.
Modern science is so well known,
that it has never been possible to perform a successful transformation of a person.
How can prayers allow something before even science has become a dead end?
Pray, believe, and your dreams will come true.
By the way, these are the ingredients I was talking about.
Even a child can buy them with his pocket money.
It's so cheap to create a person.
People are not things.
Your words are blasphemy.
Heaven will punish you for them.
Do you understand? Alchemists are scientists.
We do not believe in such abstract concepts as creator or God.
By studying the principles of creation of every thing in this world, we understand the truth.
What irony! Scientists do not believe in God,
and yet they got closer to him.
Are you doubting yourself equal to God?
How arrogant!
You're probably right.
I just remembered an ancient myth.
There was a hero who flew almost to the sun,
but his wings, glued together with wax, melted and he collapsed to the ground.
It seems so.
Brother,
tell me, can God grant salvation to a scientist like me,
who just said such terrible things?
Of course.
You can always accept our faith.
Captain, two people want to meet you.
A child and a man in armor.
They call themselves the Elric brothers.
I'm busy, let them go.
Wait, you said the Elric brothers?
Yes, that's how they looked like.
It's bad, the whole-metal alchemist Edward Elric.
So that guy in armor?
Yes, undoubtedly.
What do you need from the state alchemist here?
They couldn't have guessed our plan.
God damn army dog, it looks like you have a good smell.
Come in, please.
The founder is a very busy person,
and he rarely gives out a free minute,
but you are very lucky.
Sorry to bother you,
we won't take much time from him.
Yes, let's finish this quickly.
What are you doing?
Diagon!
These people are heretics,
they want to capture the founders.
They are the birth of the devil.
It can't be.
Hey, didn't you say
that we need to deal with this quickly?
Strike!
How noisy.
Welcome to our sacred temple,
whole-metal alchemist.
Colonel.
I'm afraid these people are completely uneducated.
Please accept my apologies for rudeness.
And you call this an apology?
And you look at us from top to bottom from this tribune?
Are you here to learn about our teaching?
Yes, I want to know a lot.
For example, how do you manage to fool these people
with your cheap tricks with alchemy?
What are you talking about?
How can you call my magic with alchemy?
What do you say, is alchemy capable of this?
That's because of the nail.
For some reason,
you manage to convert into the bypass of the laws.
I told you, this is not alchemy.
And I thought,
that with the help of one legendary thing
that increases the power of alchemy
and makes the impossible possible
for a person using it,
you managed to do it.
A thing?
Yes, in other words, a philosophical stone.
The one in your ring.
We've been looking for it for a long time.
This is an ordinary ring.
God gave me the power to do miracles.
Are you still pretending to be a fool?
Then I'll have to work on your body
so that it doesn't reveal the truth to me.
It seems that a heretic like you
will not save anything.
Rose?
Yes?
Take this gun.
Yes.
And now shoot the whole-metal alchemist.
I...
I can't.
God himself says with my lips,
this is the will of the Lord.
Rose, shoot him.
What's the matter?
Did you forget who saved you last year?
When you were at the bottom of the abyss of despair
after the loss of your beloved.
You are Cornelus Sama.
That's right. I saved you then.
And what did I promise you?
That you would return him to me.
No, it's not me.
I'm the whole-metal alchemist.
So it's you.
I'm sorry.
I have no choice.
He's a cheater.
No, it's not.
Cornelus Sama will return my beloved
with a miraculous power.
Then shoot.
Very well.
God will be pleased with you.
Now shoot the second one.
You make people do disgusting things.
What?
What's going on?
Well, you'll see.
Look.
An empty armor.
This finally proves that they were born of the devil.
I'll destroy you.
Maybe this is the first time you've seen a chimera.
So you even create such a thing with your philosophical stones?
You can't handle it with bare hands.
An unchanging circle?
It looks like the name of the state alchemist is not an empty word.
How will you like claws capable of tearing steel?
And what was it?
I'm sorry, but my leg is special.
Tear it apart with your claws.
Something's wrong, silly cat.
I'm sorry, but my leg is special.
I'm sorry, but my leg is special.
I'm sorry, but my leg is special.
Something's wrong, silly cat.
Well, how do you like it?
This is a hand.
And your brother, a walking success.
I see.
So that's how it is.
A solid metal and you...
You tried to do it, am I right?
Come down here, third-rate alchemist.
I'll show you what's the difference between us.
The voice is for free viewing.
Come down here, third-rate alchemist.
I'll show you what's the difference between us.
Rose, these two violated the greatest prohibition in alchemy.
Transformation of man.
They tried to return someone from the grave.
There was a hero who flew almost to the sun,
but his wings with clay and wax melted,
and he fell to the ground.
It can't be.
This is the body of the sinner who was burnt at the will of God.
This is the body of the sinner who was burned at the will of God.
Rose, you want to be one of those?
Rose, you want to be one of those?
Edward Elric!
So that's what a state alchemist looks like.
So that's what a state alchemist looks like.
Shut up, you third-rate alchemist
who can do anything
without a philosophical stone.
Founder, nothing has happened yet.
Please, give us the stone!
Don't make fun of me, you fools, who doubted yourself equal to God!
Now I'll send you to him!
He won't come out, I'm afraid God will hate me, and even if I get to him, he'll kick me out!
What are you doing behind them?
These heretics have stood up against our church!
Grab them!
Stop!
Hey, boy, what are you going to do there with your bare hands?
Give up, good boy, and we won't hurt you!
Don't relax just because he's a child!
He's not a child!
Don't relax just because he's a child!
Get out of the way!
Now do you understand, Rose?
Cornelia was shooting at me, even though he could have fallen into you!
That's why you...
What he said earlier, is it true?
We just wanted to see our mother smile again!
But we couldn't!
It didn't even look like a human!
Only then did we realize our mistake!
You can't resurrect a human, even your mother!
It's true!
If...
The alchemist's foundation is in exchange for the price!
And the price for human transformation is huge!
My brother lost his left leg, and I lost my body!
You see?
My brother wrote it with his own blood!
He lost his leg and must have suffered a terrible pain!
But my brother sacrificed his hand to return my soul and attach it to the armor!
I want his body to become stronger and stronger!
I want his body to become the same!
And he wants to return mine!
But we risk losing our lives too!
This is the path we chose!
But I believe...
Cornelia can do it herself!
Rose!
Even if you can't do it, Cornelia can do it herself!
She can!
She can!
Asshole!
Get ready to die!
Maybe we should talk a little, old man?
All I need is to find out the secret of your stone!
If you don't want me to mobilize the Eastern army!
And they started their investigation!
All right!
What are you going to do with the Philosopher's Stone?
Do you need this miserable, smelly church?
People come to the church who are ready to give their miserable lives for me with joy!
The strongest army is the one who is not afraid of death!
Just think, in a few years, this whole country will be mine!
Thanks to the Philosopher's Stone and these stupid people,
you may get the objects from my table!
What's so funny?
That's why I called you a third-rate!
It can't be!
Miracles don't happen!
It was all thanks to the power of the Philosopher's Stone!
You little bastard!
When did you turn it on?
When? Since the very beginning!
You lost!
What did you do?
Asshole!
Too slow!
I told you, there's too much of a difference between us!
I'm not going to win!
What? A return?
I haven't given up yet!
I... I...
...am the Lord's servant!
Let's go!
My lips say, the Lord himself!
This is the fist, the fist of the Lord!
What?
The fist of the Lord means?
If you want it so much, then test his power on yourself!
Shut up!
Give me the Philosopher's Stone!
It broke? What does it mean?
The Philosopher's Stone is a perfect material. How could it break?
I don't know. They didn't tell me anything.
Please, spare me. I'm begging you. I was wrong.
So it's a fake.
I can't do anything without a stone. Please, spare me.
We made such a way here in the hope that we can finally return our bodies.
And this is...
What about me?
At least get through the ground!
Yes, sir!
What about the Philosopher's Stone? It was a pathetic fake.
That's how it is.
And I thought I could finally return your real body.
Give me the Philosopher's Stone!
Please, spare me. I'm begging you.
Please, spare me.
This is your real body.
Give me the Philosopher's Stone!
Rose?
Didn't I tell you it was a fake?
Moreover, it broke.
You're lying. You just want to leave it to yourself, right?
To return your bodies, right?
And you want to see your mom again?
Shut up!
It's impossible to return the dead.
Never.
Never!
He said he would return it to me.
That if I pray, my wishes will come true.
That miracles happen.
How am I supposed to live now? What should I believe in?
Tell me.
Think about it yourself.
Get up and go.
Just go.
After all, you have great, healthy legs.
You don't need anything else.
What's going on?
We demand the Founder!
Where is that cheater?
Open up!
That cheater ruined all my plans.
Indeed. What a nuisance.
All you wanted was to make a little mess.
Oh, you!
Hey, Last, can I eat this stick?
No, Gluttony.
If you eat it, your stomach will hurt.
How dare you laugh at me?
We don't need you anymore.
Just think about it.
We've come so far.
And now we have to start all over again.
Father will be furious.
What will he do to us next?
