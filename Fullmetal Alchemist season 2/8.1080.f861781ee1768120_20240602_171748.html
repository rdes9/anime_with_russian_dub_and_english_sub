        <pre>Alchemy is a science that studies the structure of matter, its rupture and recreation. However, it is not omnipotent and does not allow you to create something out of nothing.
To get something, you need to replace something equal. This is the principle of equal exchange, the main basis of alchemy.
Transformation of man is the main basis of alchemy, and this prohibition is not allowed to violate anyone.

The first building of the Central State Library, where Dr. Mark's research was stored, was burned to the ground.
Thanks to Shesky, who used to work in the library, Ed and Al managed to get a cherished manuscript, but the raw material for the Philosopher's Stone are living people.
In search of the hidden truth, Ed and Al go to the abandoned fifth research laboratory.
Episode 8, fifth research laboratory
Very fast for such a tattoo, but only more interesting. Who are you?
I'm number 66, although I use it only at work.
I'll cut you into small pieces. You can start drinking already.
What the hell? Was it really used to transform the Philosopher's Stone?
Absolutely right. I don't know where you came from, baby, but the fact that you figured it out just by looking at the transform circle is amazing.
Who are you, old man?
I was ordered to guard this place. You can call me number 48.
And I'm not an old man.
I have an order to destroy anyone who enters this building. So don't be offended, baby.
You too.
Don't be offended when this baby hits you.
Alchemist, then?
Show me what you can do.
This hand saved your life, but my blade cuts through to the sixth.
Hey, wait a minute. Don't you have a body, old man?
How did you guess? I train with guys like you all the time.
Oh, so there are other guys outside who look like me, right?
How awful. Did you really find another moron like me who decided to attach his soul to the armor?
Let me introduce myself again.
Number 48 is just the death cell number.
When my body was still with me, I was a serial killer, also known as the Thrasher.
Death cell? How did I think of it?
Tell me, they were creating philosophical stones from criminals sentenced to death here, right?
I can't answer your question.
For my skills, I got this body and work as a guard dog.
So there must be a seal that connects your soul with the armor?
Yes, absolutely right.
Blood seal. You will destroy it and you will win.
How nice of you to show me your weak spot.
I just want to get as much enjoyment from our battle as possible.
Since you're so kind, maybe you'll just let me go?
No, I don't think so.
You don't think a killer can let his prey get away with it, do you?
So, let's get started.
I told you!
Elisee is turning three!
Lieutenant Colonel Hughes, I have a lot of work to do now.
Eastern city, Eastern headquarters.
What a coincidence! Me too.
But oh my god, she's so cute!
I got it, stop calling me all the time and telling me about her.
Especially in secret.
But I'm proud of her not only as my daughter, but also as a beauty and a wife.
Okay, okay, now I'm going to hear your story.
About a cute and charming scoundrel you're so proud of.
Some of the bodies have never been identified.
They've already begun to decompose, so you can't say for sure that he's among them.
But since then, no one has seen him in the East, and many believe that the scar is dead.
In this case, the bodyguards and the Elric brothers will soon be no longer needed.
Are they still under Major Armstrong's supervision?
No, it seems that his subordinates are now in charge of them.
They got us!
I thought, why so quiet?
Aha, Major Armstrong will kill us for such cowardice!
If only they knew how to protect them!
Let's go!
Where?
What do you think?
To the fifth research laboratory!
What's wrong with the shoulder?
Now it will be more resistant to rust, but because of this, its strength has decreased.
So don't overdo it.
We need to deal with him quickly, or I'll have problems!
Just like a monkey!
What did you say?
It's been a long time since I've had such a clever prey, I'm delighted!
But you're wounded and tired, and the outcome of the battle is certain.
With your companion outside, my Nakama should be able to deal with it.
Is he strong?
Yes, although weaker than me.
Then I have nothing to worry about!
As far as I remember, I have never defeated him in a fight!
I'm going to kill you!
I'm going to kill you!
I'm going to kill you!
I'm going to kill you!
Damn it!
What do you want?
Stay calm and let me kill you, little pig!
Your body!
Yes, I have a little secret.
Although, let me tell you one story.
You've probably heard about him.
It's about a man named Barry.
A long, long time ago, in the capital, there lived a butcher named Barry, who loved to cook.
Barry loved to cut meat.
But one day Barry realized that it was not enough for him to cut only veal and pigs.
At night he began to walk around the city and cut people.
In the end, Barry was caught, but by that time his victims were already 23 people.
He settled the horrors of the heart of the inhabitants of the capital, and for this he was sent to the hangar.
And they lived happily ever after.
So the story ended officially.
But in fact, she has a sequel.
Barry did not die at all.
He is still alive and guards one secret place, despite the fact that he lost his body.
That's right!
There is a sadly famous serial killer Barry the butcher in front of you!
Sorry, but I've never heard of you.
I was born in a small town in the east, so ...
Okay, even if you didn't hear about me, shouldn't you have reacted somehow?
For example, scream, or what's wrong with his body?
What's wrong with your body?
Why shout like that?
So you were sentenced to death too?
You scared me so much!
I'm not a criminal!
Yes? Then why?
But I have a little secret.
My older brother transformed my soul when I lost my body.
Brother?
I see, so your brother?
What's so funny?
Are you actually brothers?
Well, we certainly have different characters, but ...
Oh, no, no, no, I'm not talking about that.
I wanted to say that maybe you are just a doll in the armor created by your brother.
What?
Are you sure that you once existed?
Of course!
I am a real man, Alphonse Ellery, there is no doubt about it!
And where are the evidences?
I remember my life from birth!
And what if he created them too?
But Grandma and Winry ...
They are also deceiving you!
Yes, exactly!
In fact, you never existed!
But what about you?
It's simple!
Don't move!
It's closed!
See?
I love to chop live meat!
I love to kill and never calm down!
I live to kill!
I don't need other evidences of my existence!
So your younger brother is so strong?
It seems that I need to finish you off as soon as possible!
Al, now!
What?
It's not fair!
All means are good in battle!
Come on!
What's the matter?
My bloody seal is still intact, huh?
Come on, finish it!
I want to ask you something!
About the Philosopher's Stone?
I'm putting out everything you know!
No!
Hey, the loser should do what he is told!
But I haven't lost anything yet!
It can't be!
Full Metal Alchemist!
It's available for free!
Fullmetalalchemist.com
I forgot to warn you that you're going to be shocked!
In fact, there was a duet of brats!
The head and the rest are two different people!
It's cheating!
Didn't you say that all means are good in battle?
Well, let's start the second round!
Don't you dare call me a bastard!
I won't leave you time for re-education!
Damn, I lost too much blood!
Everything is floating in my eyes!
It's bad!
Bad!
I...
I'm going to die now!
Take this!
Damn!
Because of you, I remembered this bastard!
I used his attack!
What the hell did you do?
God, what a scum!
Bro!
It's embarrassing to admit, but we lost!
You won't say now,
Hey, we're actually a trio, right?
No, no!
Now finish us, kid!
I won't kill a man!
Do you think we're people?
If I don't consider you people,
it will turn out that I do not recognize the person of my younger brother!
Hey, hey, hey!
What's up?
Doll in armor!
I'm not a doll!
Is that what you think?
But do you really exist?
Are you sure about that?
I know how to prove that you're not a doll!
You also have a bloody seal!
Wipe it!
If you die, then you really were a human!
And if not, then you're just a doll!
I won't do it for nothing!
Then I'll do it for you!
My younger brother is a human!
And so are you two!
That's why I can't kill you!
Bro!
As far as I remember, my brother and I only did what we were stealing, destroying and killing!
And now, when we turned into this,
we were first accepted for people!
Interesting!
Bro, I'll tell you everything!
This will be my farewell gift!
The one who created the Philosopher's Stone and ordered us to guard this place,
he...
We almost got caught!
You're talking too much, 48th!
Oh, my God!
What is a solid metal bean doing here?
What a poor child!
How did you find out about this place?
Bro!
Bro!
Bro!
Are you insulting me?
We almost killed our precious victim!
Do you even think what you're doing?
What if our whole plan failed because of you?
Who the hell are you?
What a stupid plan!
What kind of victim are you?
Well, is our ambassador really a whore?
I'm not a whore!
I'm a whore!
I'm a whore!
I'm a whore!
I'm a whore!
I'm a whore!
I'm a whore!
I'm a whore!
I'm a whore!
Oh, my God, the bean is rotting!
Ambassador, Ambassador!
What have you done?
There is an ambassador, isn't there?
I don't like fights.
It hurts to get hurt.
You started it first!
I'll show you!
Oh, it broke!
What?
Good luck!
Are you happy that your hand is broken?
Otherwise, you wouldn't dress so easily.
Remember it well.
You're alive only because we let you do it.
We will be in trouble if someone else finds this place.
We need to replace the traces.
I've been wanting to tell you something for a long time.
But I was afraid to talk to you about it all the time.
What did the brother mean?
What was he afraid to say?
What was he afraid to say?
Maybe you're just a doll created by your brother?
Were you really a human?
What's the matter, doll?
Shut up!
I...
Calm down, it'll make it easier for you.
You've opened up, little pig!
What?
Don't move!
Give up!
Well...
Sergeant, we need to get out of here!
What are you waiting for?
We need to get out of here!
Well, brother, we're still there!
What did you say?
Looks like I have no choice.
I'm leaving!
Hey!
You guys should hurry up, too!
Come on, stop!
Brother, brother!
Let's get out of here!
Otherwise, we'll be in trouble, too!
But...
Salute!
Here's your package.
Brother?
He's going to live, but he lost a lot of blood,
so you'd better take him to the hospital as soon as possible.
Oh, and take a closer look at him
so that he doesn't break the drop again.
He's too valuable material.
Who are you?
Lyuda!
Lyuda!
Lyuda!
Lyuda!
Lyuda!
Lyuda!
Lyuda!
Lyuda!
Who are you?
Lieutenant Ross!
Hurry up!
Sergeant!
Help me!
Who did this to him?
We'll figure it out later.
You'd better leave, too.
What?
Has he run away?
Let us out!
Don't let us die!
Quiet!
Get down!
It's a lovely sound!
The sound of the building collapsing after the explosion.
It's so close.
It must be the fifth research laboratory.
Oh, what a pleasant sound!
It breaks me to bones!
Shut the bar, Kimbley!
Oh, I'm sorry.
It just reminded me of the destruction of Ishvara.
What sweet memories!
Maybe you're just a doll created by your brother?

By the way, about the capital.
Thanks to Shuram, several shishiks responsible for the safety of state alchemists flew from their places.
That's it!
There are rumors that soon a certain Colonel Mustang will be invited to the capital.
To the capital, it means...
Not bad.
Be careful.
Getting so high in your age means making a bunch of enemies.
I'm ready for that.
Listen to the wise advice of the senior comrade.
You have to find a person who will understand and always support you.
So...
Get married as soon as possible.
Go to hell!
Did he hang up?
Colonel Hughes, you used the service phone for personal conversations again.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Edward Ellery, who did not dare to speak.
And Alfonso Ellery, who was stunned by Barry's words.
Only one thing is clear.
The memories of this girl cannot be lied to.
Next time on Metal Alchemist.
Episode 9.
The fake feelings.
Once they trusted each other, but now their hearts are wavering.
