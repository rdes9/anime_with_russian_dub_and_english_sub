Colonel, don't you dare transform a man
Do you know what Mustang-kun does?
Yes?
I understand
Great, so we can start
I understand you, senior lieutenant
I will not transform a man
You're going to leave her to die?
How cruel
Cruel?
And this tells me the one for whom people spend a lot of money
They will be glad to give their lives for me
I picked them up when they died of hunger, abandoned by their parents
I gave them blood and food, I gave them education
I put them on their feet
They should be grateful to me
And you yourself are bad at holding on to your feet
Disappeared?
Episode 59, Lost Light
Indeed, I should thank you
Sometimes being a chemist is very useful
But sometimes being a chemist is very useful
But sometimes being a chemist is very useful
But sometimes being a chemist is very useful
Indeed, I should thank you
Sometimes being a chemist is very useful
Let me go!
Let me go!
Tell your guys to drop their weapons
Tell your guys to drop their weapons
I am the only chemist doctor here
If you kill me, this girl is over
I know you
You are not a doctor for me, but for nothing
I am the only chemist doctor here
If you kill me, this girl is over
I know you
I am the only chemist doctor here
If you kill me, this girl is over
Tell your guys to drop their weapons
Tell you guys to drop their weapons
Lieutenant! Lieutenant! Lieutenant!
You're alive!
We need to take him down!
Don't you dare die!
Hold on, Senior Lieutenant!
It's more important!
I'll help her!
Lieutenant!
I stopped the bleeding!
But she still needs a doctor!
Thank you!
Colonel, forgive me!
Don't talk! You need to rest!
Thank you for understanding!
My view!
It's not for nothing that we worked so hard together!
Just try to transform a person and I'll shoot you like a dog!
You wanted to tell me that, didn't you?
This is the last one!
Thank you all! You saved us!
You're always welcome!
Oh, yes! The Philosopher's Stone!
King Bradley!
His body is not recovering!
Long time no see, Mustang-kun!
And don't talk!
At first, I wanted to say that you haven't changed a bit, but it looks like it's not the case.
Die, Bradley!
I thought if a person close to you died in front of you, you would transform without any hesitation!
That's what I would have done a little while ago.
But now there are people around me who can tell me to stop in time.
I was sure that people are just pathetic creatures, incapable of teaching me how to live.
And now, in front of me, there is a man who could change so quickly.
People are really...
Unpredictable creatures.
What's going on?
Down there...
It's right below us!
You bastards!
You bastards! I won't let you get in his way!
Calm down, old man!
Are you done already?
Jules!
Hold on!
Hurry up and run!
Bad news!
We need to get out of here!
Take care of her!
Colonel!
You did a great job, Bradley!
What did you expect from my masterpiece?
Colonel Mustang, you're the last one.
You're our fifth victim.
You're greatly appreciated.
Liam!
Wait for me.
Wait.
mannequin!
I don't believe it!
Hello there!
Linda?
I didn't think it would come to this, but I have no choice.
We have little time.
We will make you open the gate, Colonel Mustang.
I will not.
Now that the Pride has swallowed the alchemist who has the necessary knowledge, your wishes no longer matter.
We use it as a material.
I hold it. Get out of the circle.
I wonder what they will take from you.
Colonel, you can't. You will be pulled too.
Colonel!
Here is the result of human transformation. Is it really that old man?
Where is the colonel?
Don't be afraid. Mustang-kun is now with his father.
However, I am not sure that he came there whole and unharmed.
Well, you see for yourself in what condition I am.
Who will get the honor forever in this world?
Chimera?
Strangers?
Mustangs of Mustang?
Or each of you wants to be part of the legend?
Damn it!
He's just an old man from the wounded, but I feel that we have no choice.
I have to go.
I have to go.
I have to go.
Damn it!
He's just an old man from the wounded, but I feel that we have no chance against him.
Under us.
Under this tunnel.
When May said, it's right under us.
That old man just nodded.
It seems he was screaming, I won't let you get in his way.
Definitely, he didn't want us to go there.
So the center of the circle is there?
Yes.
There is an incredibly powerful key down there.
Then...
Commander!
Let's go!
Commander!
Nstandzic, I brought a fifth one.
Alfonso Elric is still not with us.
Are you all right, Colonel?
It's you, metalhead.
Where are we?
In the lair of the main boss.
What happened to you, Colonel?
They dragged me into the strange white world.
There were only huge gates.
Doors?
What did they take?
Your legs are in place, and your hands too.
It's all metal.
How can you see my body in such darkness?
What are you talking about?
It's so dark here, I can't see anything.
The light!
Where did the light go?
It can't be!
So you're blind?
That's great.
To be honest, among all the state alchemists, you had the most dangerous abilities.
And now you're helpless like a baby.
Colonel, did you really transform a man?
Who do you think you're taking me for?
I helped him open the gate a little.
And the result exceeded all expectations.
Colonel Mustang, the most dangerous among you, has already left the game.
It's really cruel.
Two brothers were blinded by the desire to resurrect their mother, dreaming of feeling her warmth again.
For this, one of them lost his leg, which he could firmly stand on, and the only native person.
And the other one had the opportunity to feel the warmth that he was so desperate for.
The woman who tried to return her dead child lost the opportunity to become a mother.
And finally, the man who dreamed of protecting his homeland lost his sight and will never see her future.
Each of you has suffered a deserved punishment, leaving his pride in place.
God has judged you for who you are.
The truth itself.
And what the f**k is this?
I do not argue that we, having committed a grave sin, have deserved our punishment.
But to take the sight of a man whose forces forced him to open the gate, who, in spite of everything, decided not to convert, is that fair to you?
What the f**k is injustice?
Do you still hope to become a father?
F**k!
F**k!
Call me by your real name.
But I have no name.
I gave up on him.
What a coincidence! After all, I do not remember my real name either.
The battle of two nameless warriors. I like it.
May!
It's him!
You still got through here, damn brat!
He looks different, but I can feel it.
You are the main immortal!
You are the main immortal!
You are the main immortal!
You are the main immortal!
You are the main immortal!
You are the main immortal!
You are the main immortal!
You are the main immortal!
What happened to Alphonse Sama?
What happened to Alphonse Sama?
I do not know, it seems he is unconscious.
Oh no!
Alphonse Sama!
Alphonse Sama!
Please clarify!
Alphonse Sama!
My body!
My body!
I've been waiting for you for so long.
Welcome back!
Why are my hands so thick?
Skin and bones!
I can not stand on my feet!
I can not stand on my feet!
I can not stand on my feet!
God!
How?
How can I fight with such a body?
Everyone else is fighting now!
Do not you want to return me?
Of course I want!
Every day, every moment of all these years I dreamed of how to return my body!
But...
I can not!
I can not be in such a body!
Not now!
Do you want to return there?
Do you want to return in this body?
I will not keep you!
I will not keep you!
I'm sorry, I'll be back!
Wait a little more!
I will definitely come back for you!
I promise!
Al!
Are you okay, Al?
Alphonse Sama!
Sensei!
Brother!
May!
Stop, where are we?
You sacrificed your body, which you have been looking for all these years to help your friends!
My noble soul!
For me it will be an honor to become your vessel again!
However, your return will bring only despair and death to the world!
Alphonse!
Finally!
All together!
