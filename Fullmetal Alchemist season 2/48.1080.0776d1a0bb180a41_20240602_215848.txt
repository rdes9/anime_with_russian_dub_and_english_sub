Xenna Metal Alchemist
But now there's nothing left to be afraid of
The strong bonds that bind our hearts
Will never be broken
We'll keep searching
We've reached
This place, this period
The light of sadness changes into power
The fate is right next to us
What are you doing?
Young master, let's talk later, don't get distracted
Yes
Let me eat you
Holy shit!
You take care of such a cool girl as a secret weapon
And you're a shopkeeper
That's right, thank you
Who are you?
How do you see me in this darkness?
Holy shit!
Emperor Xinga is considered the God's messenger on Earth
Because he has the blood flowing through the dragon veins
We, his servants, see the flow of the ki, like material objects
In the remote darkness, we orient ourselves in the same way as in the light of day
That voice!
Haven't seen you for a long time, boy
Old man Fu?
How did you find us?
We were in the capital collecting information
I felt several huge ki sources
And we went in their direction
Right in front of us are two strong ki
It must be Grit and Glotani
Grit!
The scoundrel who stole the body of the young master
In the forest, I feel a more powerful ki
One of us is fighting with a homunculus named Pride
I see
But that's not all
There is something in the city that is much better than all of them
It must be your father, Ed
He?
Your father is not a human?
Forget about him for now
The main thing now is to deal with the homunculus
You can't not worry about Glotani
Renfan will deal with him
Deal with him?
It's only been half a year since she was put in the car
She's in her mind
If we don't help her, she's a dead man
What the hell?
Don't worry about her
The martial arts are not our only weapon
We need to warn them before they start shooting
What?
Explosions?
What's going on?
In the forest?
Is the light still on?
We need a light bulb
Damn
At least we don't have to worry about her
Listen, old man
Do you have these light bulbs too?
You're asking again?
With tear gas, light bulbs, incandescent
The city is starting to light up
The shadows of Pride will be back soon
But then Heinkel is in danger
Yes
Old man Fu, can you take me to Pride?
I need your help
No problem
Heinkel
Be careful
Heinkel is fighting Pride, but...
What's going on?
Die already
The End
As you said, young Roy
Selim Bradley was definitely not a human
All the photos are old
This one is 20 years old
And this one is already half a century old
He was always with the authorities
Besides, I checked Puror's hometown
There are a lot of papers confirming that he was born and raised there
But none of the old people remember a man named Bradley
Obviously, the house where he allegedly lived serves only for the sake of the eye
And of course, he has no relatives
Thank you, Madame Christmas
I can imagine how much effort you spent on this
And don't say
But when I realized that Selim was not a human
I had a second breath
But why didn't anyone know about this before?
He is the son of a man who bears the nickname of the king and is head of the totalitarian state
They could easily fake the necessary documents
Oh, you little...
Hey! Who's there?
What's going on here?
A monster!
It attacked the child!
A monster!
Shit!
Now I have a reliable source of light
Farewell, Mr. Chimera
I think I'm on time
I can't believe you're such a fag
You're actually a homunculus
It's not bad that you've been wiping our glasses all this time, Selim
You can't judge a book by its cover
Isn't that right?
A solid metal bean
Where is he?
Where is Roy Mustang?
Still inside
It's been a long time since he's been sitting there
This is Madame Christmas
Her real name is Chris Mustang
She is the mother of the colonel
Shit!
Oh, my house was crying
I'm sorry, I'll buy you a new one soon
Well, in that case, everything is fine
But for now, I'd better lie down on the bottom
Girls, be safe
Don't worry, they've already left the country
You've left them a lot of trouble, so now they have time to have fun
Now you have to think only about yourself and the future of our country
I don't want you to lie in a body bag with a beer and a traitor the next time we meet
Thank you, Madame
I'll definitely pay you back for everything
If you want to thank me, go up to the top
I have high hopes for you, little Roy
Stop talking to me like that, Selim
Stop talking to me like that, Selim
Okay, it's time to get down to business

You're late, Colonel
We were going to leave without you
I didn't think I'd be so glad to hear your whining again
Are you sure you didn't have a tail?
No
He would let us know
I see
And you're a good boy
There's news about Bradley's family
I've found out their plans for the next three days
The Fuhrer is now watching the studies in the east
Selim left with him
By the way, the Fuhrer's train was blown up and fell off a cliff
Well, well, old Grumman in his old age
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry
I'm sorry
Well, well, old Grumman in his old age
Now they will be extremely careful
It complicates our task
What about our plan?
Will the Eastern Army enter the capital?
The Fuhrer is gone
Is it a chance of a lifetime or a trap?
Even if it's a trap, we have no choice
Are we waiting for your orders?
Each of us has pulled out a ticket to one end
It doesn't matter how it ends, we have nowhere to retreat
Even if we win and I become the Fuhrer
You have to work hard to restore and change our country
Therefore, I will give only one order that you will fulfill at any cost
I order you to survive
All clear?
Yes, sir
Let's go
Why?
Why can't I bronze it?
The northern armored car was useful to me again
More precisely, the carbon fiber with which it is stuffed
Carbon shield?
I copied Greed's technique
Well, then
What's the matter?
Are you finished already?
I just started
Alph!
Why don't you continue the battle with your brother?
Let's go, Fuha!
Light grenade
So that you...
Stay away from me!
What?
What's wrong with you, Ranfan?
Ranfan!
Gorillus Sun!
Got it!
Alph!
Gorillus Sun didn't get out of here
He is controlled by Pride, isn't he?
Dissolved parts of the body of the homunculus are dissolved and disappear
Now that we have divided Alph with the rest of the shadow, Pride will no longer be able to control him
You will not go anywhere!
Get another one!
Hey, I saw a flash
Alph!
Ouch, it hurts!
It's not bad
I don't see you very much
I'm afraid of this girl and Greed
They see me even in the dark
Really?
Yes
So these are the warriors from Xing that Raz told you about
Those who can feel the homunculus
You use the ability of this prince to grieve you
Gluttony
How many times have you already died?
A lot
I even lost count
I also managed to grieve them
If it goes on like this, then we will lose
Then my father will fix me again!
What?
No!
Don't, Pride!
No!
Don't eat me!
It hurts!
Save me, Lask!
He ate his Nakamo!
Well, now it's a completely different matter
I smell the smell of each of you
Although the unwavering voice of the warrior is still in my heart
I will not give up
I will not give up
I will not give up
I will not give up
I will not give up
I will not give up
Although the unwavering hunger that got me in trouble is a little annoying
What?
This smell?
So you are here too?
Hohenheim
Release is not for sale
I will not give up
I will not give up
I will not give up
I will not give up
I will not give up
I will not give up
I will not give up
I will not give up
I will not give up
I will not give up
I will not give up
I will not give up
I will not give up
I will not give up
I will not give up
I will not give up
I will not give up
I will not give up
I will not give up
I will not give up
I will not give up
I will not give up
I will not give up
I will not give up
I will not give up
I will not give up
I will not give up
I will not give up
I will not give up
I will not give up
I will not give up
I will not give up
I will not give up
You narrows
Have a furtive
What's the next step?
In his place, first of all, I would like to capture Bradley's wife.
As a hostage?
How stupid!
Take a useless hostage to expose yourself as a traitor?
Your stupidity does not stop me to surprise people.
What's the next step?
Hey, what are you doing?
Roy Mustang?
I'm sorry to disturb you at such a late hour.
Lieutenant Hawkeye? What's going on here?
I'm sorry for scaring you.
We will not harm you if you agree to go with us.
Please, let's go.
Every memory leaves a mark on the heart.
But if this mark does not belong to a person, people feel fear.
Next, in the goal on the metal alchemist, episode 49, the feeling of a father and a son.
Let the stone on the heart, but they all meet the dawn.
The end
