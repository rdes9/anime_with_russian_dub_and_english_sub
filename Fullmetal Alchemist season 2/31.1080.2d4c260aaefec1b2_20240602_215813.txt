In the next episode
Rebellion?
Shit!
Damn it, Ram!
How did he know that Mark was involved in the destruction of Ishvar?

I'll keep you in the know.
By appointing your adjutant, the Fuhrer has practically made you a hostage, isn't that right?
Everything will be fine with you.
There is a positive moment. The adjutant will surely have a chance to cut the Fuhrer's throat while he is asleep.
Terrible.
Oh, by the way, tell the colonel that Sharam is still here.
Okay.
Senior Lieutenant.
Yes.
Thank you for telling me about Ishwar.
Episode 31. The promised 520 cents.
Al!
Brother, what happened?
So that's what happened in Ishwar.
She told me about everything without making a discount on the fact that I am still a child.
Alchemists are those who seek the truth.
And we...
...still haven't gotten close to her.
I wonder, did the colonel think about what to do after he reaches his goal?
After he reaches his goal.
Al, what do you want to do when we return your body?
I think the first thing I want to do is try Winry's apple pie.
What about you, brother?
To be honest, I was only thinking about how to get our bodies back.
First, we will have to visit Sensei and his grandmother so that they know about it first.
Exactly, because they have done so much for us.
Do you think they will be happy to see us?
Oh, we see smiles on their faces again.
Yes.
It seems that everything is going nowhere, but these thoughts have raised my mood.
Besides, now we have hope.
Remember, when we were in those catacombs, alchemy ceased to work.
At that time, it could not be used on the surface either.
But that girl is a scar.
That's right, only their alchemy worked.
So there must be something in their alchemy.
Something we don't know yet.
Yes, we will still fight.
She left?
That girl left?
Yes, it's still early in the morning.
Didn't she say where?
No.
We need to find her.
In the capital, without a single clue?
We have a clue.
What the hell is this?
A gift.
Damn it.
Couldn't you bring me a nice girl as a gift to the magazine?
Don't relax until we're not here.
Are you leaving already?
Yes.
I can't wait to try the luxuries of Western cuisine.
Are you staying here for the main thing?
Yeah.
See you later.
You have to eat a lot to grow strong.
Then you can protect your friends.
Captain Fury?
Yes.
You haven't left yet?
I came to return something to the colonel.
I'm used to working in the capital.
You were transferred to the Southern Staff, Captain?
Yes.
In the opposite direction with you.
I keep steam in the Northern Staff.
A real freezer.
Okay, see you later, Captain.
Bye.
Captain Fury?
Yes.
See you later.
Colonel, may I come in?
Senior Lieutenant?
I came to take my things.
I see.
Looks like the slave is still in the capital.
I have to be very careful.
I lost a great bodyguard.
Please try not to die.
I'll try.
I'm sorry I dragged you into this bad story.
Maybe I made a mistake by following you.
If you think it was a mistake, shoot me.
You made a promise.
We'll still work together.
You're too kind to me, Lieutenant.
Colonel, take care of yourself.
You too.
And please, don't quit your job.
Of course.
I've already lost a great bodyguard.
Can I say that my job is my hobby?
Elephant.
That's right, it's an honor for me.
Good job.
Thank you.
Horse.
I'm not very smart.
I didn't learn it with much effort.
And...
If that's what you want, I'll follow you even to hell.
Even my queen.
But the mat is not set yet.
Not yet.
This is what this cat looks like.
I'm looking for a little girl who carries this thing with her.
I'm sorry, please don't pay attention to this monster.
Damn, no one saw this black and white cat.
Maybe she's not in the capital anymore.
A single metal one.
Colonel?
I see, so it's Ren Tanjutsu Ksing?
Okay, I'll ask my people.
To be honest, I don't really want to become your debtor, Colonel.
Oh, by the way, about debts.
Give me back my money.
Look at the road!
Do you still remember?
How much was it? 500 cents?
520.
Don't try to fool me!
Damn it!
With this pace, you'll never become a big bump!
I'm sorry.
You know, I'll leave this money with me.
I'll return it after you become a Fuhrer.
Who told you?
Senior Lieutenant Houkei.
And she told me about Ishivari.
A single metal one.
This debt stays with you, but don't even dream about it.
You don't have to return it.
Okay, but when this day comes, I'll take 520 cents from you again.
I'll say I'll return them when there's democracy in your country.
And after I return that debt, I'll make another promise.
In other words, I'll have to live a very, very long life to get my money back.
That's right.
So that Senior Lieutenant Houkei doesn't have to worry about you.
Thank you for throwing it away.
Yeah, see you soon.
You're finally back.
I'm already tired of waiting for you.
It's me.
Oh, you're back.
I missed you so much.
You look good, Vanessa.
It's been a long time.
Good evening, Mrs. Christmas.
How are you?
I've been better.
So I came to cheer you up.
What are you going to drink?
I haven't recovered yet, so no alcohol.
Can I have your special dish, madam?
I'll do it.
Colonel General Grumman, you have a call from the capital.
This woman was introduced as Madame Christmas.
Oh, come on.
Please don't give you any more numbers of this secret civil line.
But that's the only way I can feel useful.
Although someone has something to do with this old man.
Fullmetal Alchemist.
Sounded for free from the site anidap.com.
You've lost your hand and couldn't protect the young master.
I feel sorry for you.
Hey, what are you doing?
You were chosen for this mission and family, I...
How could you?
Hey, calm down, old man.
She's seriously injured.
Calm down, Grumman.
She's really gone.
Your hand is gone.
I'm sorry, old man.
I'm sorry.
You fool.
You fool.
We promised Ranfan to introduce her to the auto-armor mechanic.
It's useless.
Thank you for everything you've done.
But I can't accept your help.
We'll find the auto-armor mechanic ourselves.
But we can't leave you like this.
Now that the enemy has seen Ranfan's face, we can't take the risk and drag your friends into it.
I understand.
Thank you.
You saved my granddaughter's life.
Thank you.
I'm not the doctor who deserves thanks.
Thank you, doctor.
Just get out of here.
Or the care of people will become my habit.
I mean it.
I'm sorry.
The state of the emperor is getting worse every day.
We must find the young master as soon as possible and return home together with the secret of immortality.
Let's go.
Yes.
You won't get him.
He's gone.
We'll be back.
Thank you.
I'll never forget everything you've done for me.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And after all this, they consider me a doctor again?
Wait a second.
Who's there?
You?
Good evening, father.
Long time no see.
Hello, dear.
Yeah.
My mother and I were passing by and...
I see you've grown up.
And you seem to have lost weight.
Thank you.
Aren't you too tired at work?
As usual, the only company I have is the corpses.
But you know, I recently treated two living people.
You'll laugh, but I was told that I saved their lives.
Father, I started studying medicine, too.
I understand how hard it was for you after you survived in Ishvara.
But you didn't give up your job anyway.
I've always respected and loved you, father.
Maybe you'll come in?
Of course not, but I'll make you some coffee.
It's awful, there's so much garbage here.
Let's clean up a little while father makes the coffee.
God, if you really exist, please forgive me.
Even a sinner like me has the right to enjoy a cup of coffee with his family.
Now all of Ishvara is under the control of our army.
Great job, Major Kimble.
How do you like the philosophy, Heming?
It's wonderful.
I could make any transformations without thinking about the equal exchange.
Okay, I'll report your success to the capital.
Now give us back the stone.
What are you doing, Kimble?
Well, only you know that I have the philosophy stone.
You bastard!
What the hell? What happened? What is it?
Oh my.
Kimble, come out, you're being released.
What could have happened?
Don't ask unnecessary questions.
Is this an order from above?
Shut up.
I don't understand why you weren't executed for the murder of five senior officers.
Do you have a patron saint in Verkha?
No, nothing like that.
I guess it's all about my affection.
Don't make me laugh, you crazy bastard.
What does the authorities think about releasing such a psychopath like you?
Thank you for taking care of me all this time.
Don't come back here again.
Is this a sign of my gratitude?
But not this. Wait!
Stop! Please, take them off!
Stop! Please, take them off!
Stop! Please, take them off!
Stop! Please, take them off!
Stop! Please, take them off!
Kimble!
It's just a toy.
I think your kids will like it.
Good luck.
And where to now?
Long time no see, Kimble.
Congratulations on your release.
So this is your business.
Yes, we have a shortage of staff.
So you have a job for me.
Do you remember Dr. Mark?
The scientist who created the Philosopher's Stone?
I remember him very well.
I remember him very well.
So Mark ran away.
Or rather, maybe he ran away.
Maybe?
We are not sure yet.
One of the guards who guarded him disappeared.
And Mark specializes in the transformation of living organisms.
And even worse.
Maybe his body is a fake.
Most likely, he ran away with a scab called a scar.
Doesn't it touch the self-loathing of alchemists,
whose duty was to destroy Ishwar?
You're right.
It's outrageous that one of these bastards slipped away from me.
When you find the scar, you can kill it.
But we need Mark alive.
I can't believe you freed me for such a cool job.
If you catch Mark,
I'll teach him a lesson.
You'll erase one town from the face of the earth.
How do you like this job?
It's a terrible plan.
Finally, I can use it again.
Perhaps this will not be enough to destroy the whole city.
This is...
Would you also create it from Ishwarites?
No, this time the material was used by Mark's assistants.
Now it's really terrible.
Why did you help me escape?
After all, I...
I still have a few questions for you.
I want to know everything about this alchemist, Kimbley.
And...
I couldn't decipher part of the research that my brother left.
Research?
Before his death, he told me that the alchemy of this country hides something terrible.
I think we can understand what it is by reading his notes.
You're a talented alchemist.
Can you decipher his code?
The alchemy of this country hides something terrible?
Master!
That baby is back!
Shuram-san, are you okay?
Do we have a new comrade?
He's not our comrade. His name is Mark.
He created the Philosopher's Stone and participated in the destruction of Ishwar.
Philosopher's Stone?
Immortal?
Mark-san, do you know how to create a stone?
How?
Please tell me.
No, I don't.
Forget about it.
You don't have to look for this shit.
I destroyed only the skin on his face.
Stop the blood.
Now.
It will be easier for us to leave the city unnoticeably with a person who does not look like Mark.
Let's go.
What? Where?
To where I hid the notes of my brother.
At seven o'clock in the morning.
At seven o'clock in the morning.
To the north.
To the north.
To the north.
The one who has been in the shadows all this time appears on the stage with a smile.
Another knot in the tangled and full danger of the web of the capital.
Next time, the goal on the metal alchemist, episode 32.
The son of the Fuhrer.
The son of the Fuhrer.
The son of the Fuhrer.
The son of the Fuhrer.
The son of the Fuhrer.
Sometimes it's better not to know anything.
Or?
