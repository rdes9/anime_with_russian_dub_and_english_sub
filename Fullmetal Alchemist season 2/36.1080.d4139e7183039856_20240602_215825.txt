Episode 36 Family Portrait
13 years ago
Why don't you pet them? Aren't they your children?
I don't want them to turn into monsters like me.
Fool, if it could be caught as a cold, then I would have become like this a long time ago.
I have seen so many deaths since I got this body.
But I escaped from this nightmare, convincing myself that death is just a part of the great stream.
And I discovered many beautiful and amazing things in this world, and every time I admired them, I thought that it was not so bad to have this body.
And continue to live.
It was like that until I met you, Trisha, and we had no children.
I'm not getting old, but my sons are growing up in front of me.
And it scares me.
It reminds me that I'm actually a monster.
Honey, honey, come out for a minute.
What is it?
Good afternoon, dear...
...photographer.
Come on, I'll fix your tie.
After all, we still don't have a family portrait.
But it's so unexpected.
Here, take this.
Well...
We are ready.
Please start.
You can do it.
Okay, look here.
And don't move.
One day I will also turn into a monster with a wrinkled old bark.
But you know, it doesn't matter how we look, I want us to keep smiling and taking pictures together.
So please, always stay a part of this family.
Don't move, as if you're a stranger to us.
And stop calling yourself a monster.
Okay, now the bird will fly out.
Honey, smile.
I already made up my mind with this body and planned to live like this forever.
But now everything has changed.
I want to grow old and die with Trisha and the children.
That bastard.
Now they won't break for a long time.
What did you do there?
I fixed the jaw.
Doesn't it look like you?
I've never done anything for them.
So I decided to do it for them.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I've never done anything for them.
So I decided to do it for them.
Trisha, I'm leaving.
Please wait for me.
Okay.
And don't tell the children about my body.
Okay, you won't even say goodbye to them.
I'm afraid to cry if I see their faces.
Durin, it's normal to cry when you say goodbye.
Well, well, you got up so early today.
Al said he wanted to pee.
You care so much about him.
Thank you, Ed.
I'm sorry.
Just a little more.

What's going on?
Nothing.
There's still no connection.
Great.
Now we can't contact the headquarters.
What are we going to do?
Move on?
There must be a mine through which the soil was taken out.
Let's go through a little more.
Smith, go back to the headquarters and report the situation.
Yes, sir!
What's going on?
There must be a mine through which the soil was taken out.

There must be a mine through which the soil was taken out.
Go to battle!
You wanted to have an immortal army, didn't you?
Klyunov!
An eternal life, an eternal youth, and it's tempting, isn't it?
You're a bitch, bitch!
You're a bitch, bitch!
You're a bitch, bitch!
You're a bitch, bitch!
You're a bitch, bitch!
You're a bitch, bitch!
You're a bitch, bitch!
All this is so unexpected, I don't even know what to answer.
Are you interested in my offer or not? There are only two options for the answer.
You intrigued me.
If that day comes, does it mean that not only me, but also my people will receive immortality?
When this day comes, yes.
So you can't guarantee anything until that day comes.
If I go blind after him, I'll just help finish their work in Brixie.
And if I refuse, they will get rid of me and put their puppet on my place.
Well, not an easy choice.
Excuse me.
What's the matter?
Excuse me for distracting you, ma'am.
Is the front squad in the tunnel?
Something happened in the tunnel.
Everything's fine, go on.
Yes, sir.
Something happened to the squad.
I see, I'm going there.
I'm with you.
We're leaving.
Wait!
We need to get in touch.
What's going on here, Buccaneer?
We're transferring the Elerich brothers from the eastern block to the western one.
Who is this man?
Zolf J. Kimbley.
He's a guest of Colonel Raven's general.
Kimbley?
So he's the alchemist.
The Elerich brothers must be.
Are you a metal alchemist?
I see.
Does your costume justify your nickname?
Ah, so it's you.
How long is this going to go on, mother of yours?
My respect for the metal alchemist.
What do you think?
General.
Report.
We lost contact with the squad sent to explore the tunnel.
Soon after that, Smith's horse returned, along with his arm.
Only the arm?
What about his body?
I don't know.
The horse is very frightened.
It's unlikely that it will be able to be used now.
Heinzel, immediately confirm the escape.
This is very bad, Lieutenant General.
This tunnel is too dangerous.
Where is the biological weapon you were talking about?
Put him back in the tunnel and lock the entrance.
But our people, I'm talking to the Lieutenant General.
Isn't there such a law here?
Submit to my power, General Armstrong.
For free viewing.

My name is Raven.
His Excellency told me about you.
Hi.
Looks like you didn't say anything unnecessary to these people.
Well, yes, we promised.
I see you're not happy with something.
Do I have to be happy for you after my friend was taken hostage?
Excuse me, when can we get out of here?
Didn't you promise that we could continue our journey until we get up on your way?
Don't worry, I'll take care of letting you go.
This tunnel is also part of your plan.
If they find out, don't worry about it either.
General, Lieutenant Armstrong agreed to return the homunculus to the tunnel and lock the entrance.
Now it's on our side.
General, what about the search for the missing squad?
Calm down, Hensel, they can still be alive and waiting for us.
I told you to calm down.
Shut up and obey.
I obeyed his power, right?
So even the unscrupulous northern rock of Briggs bowed before them.
Well, that was a reasonable choice.
So here he is.
Good morning, Slots. Did you sleep well?
Who are you? I still want to sleep.
No, no, you have work to do.
Didn't Pride tell you?
Pride?
I'm tired of it, but I'm going to dig.
Boring.
Why am I so bored?
It's boring to even remember.
Don't be afraid.
He is a chemist and performs the order of the central headquarters.
He works to make the tunnel safe.
And now, gentlemen Briggs, close this passage.
You are the ones I shared this secret with, my comrades.
The most important part is written in the ancient Ishvar language.
I can't read it.
Is there really nothing we can't do?
If Sharana were here, he would have been able to read it.
I don't think so.
I don't think so.
I don't think so.
I don't think so.
Is there really nothing we can't do?
If Sharana were here, he would have been able to read it.
Ishvar priest must be familiar with the ancient language.
I hope everything is fine with Sharana.
They are here.
A girl with a black and white cat.
Great, let's go.
Sharana.
Yoki.
Have you found the records of your brother?
Yes, of course.
Let's get out of here.
The soldiers of Briggs already know about this place.
Come on.
A few days later.
That's better.
We are chosen.
We will be given the power of the gods and will rule the world.
Smith.
That's what he was called.
It's a pity, but there's nothing to help the front line.
Do you want to say that the weak must be sacrificed for the sake of the chosen?
That's right.
The strongest survives.
The weak will become the foundation of our country, and the strong will rise above them.
Could it be that Ishvar too?
That's right.
Ishvar was also part of our plan.
That's right.
Ishvar was also part of our plan.
In the first place, the fate of any weak nation is destruction.
I see.
Give it to me.
Yes, sir.
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.
I see you often use your phone.
Where is Colonel General Raven?
I have a message for him.
You were mortally wounded, but were able to recover in just one day.
What kind of magic do you use?
It has nothing to do with you.
You were convicted of the murder of senior officers.
Why were you suddenly released?
I told you it had nothing to do with you.
And how long has this plan been in effect?
I heard that from the day of the founding of the country.
And it was an honor for our generation to complete it.
Thank you for your cooperation, General Lieutenant Armstrong.
I will solve all the questions at the very top and prepare a place for you.
It's nothing.
What?
Was it the left or right hand of Smith?
What are you?
Isn't it terrible to get old, General Raven?
You used to be a brave young soldier who wanted to defend his country with all his heart.
You?
You could have become one of the chosen ones.
I promised to prepare a place for you.
I have nothing to do with a new place.
I'd better get rid of one rotten ass of yours.
To hell with dogs!
You're a weird goat.
Death!
It was in front of you.
As you said, you will get great material for the foundation of this fortress, General Raven.
I dreamed of becoming immortal.
Bacchus, tell Miles.
Yes.
The rest of you keep working, General.
Thank you.
Yes.
The rest of you keep working, General.
Thank you.
Make sure it lies flat.
Yes.
Don't you think it's too much?
Is it because I am a state alchemist who participated in the Ishvar Company?
What can I do to satisfy you?
Do you want to know how your people died?
Shut up, Kimbley.
I told you to shut up.
Just a minute, Major.
I have a message from Lieutenant General Armstrong.
The operation is over.
You don't have to kill time anymore.
Got it.
Thank God.
I don't need to communicate with this monster anymore.
Let it be just a game.
Kimbley!
It looks like Colonel General Raven is missing.
Do you know where he could have gone?
Missing?
That's very bad.
This is not the best place for a walk for kids from the headquarters.
If something happened to Colonel General,
it would be very nice.
If something happens to General Raven,
I can act at my discretion.
That's what the Fuhrer said.
Will you take me to the foot of the mountain, Major Miles?
Do you understand?
From this moment on, my words are the words of the Fuhrer himself.
Please wait, General.
If we completely close the passage,
we will no longer be able to find Smith and the others.
We figured out how it could all end,
and so we asked for help.
Killed?
Colonel General Raven?
That's all I had to tell you.
Hey, wait!
When will they let us out of here?
Who knows?
Ask Lieutenant General.
Damn it.
From the fact that you will be angry,
nothing will change, brother.
It's better to rest while there is a chance.
How can I rest when this is happening?
I don't know.
Hi, guys.
I came to visit the metal alchemist.
Oh, it seems that I'm not very happy here.
Well, I brought you a guest.
A guest?
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Hey, dude!
Why did you come here?
What do you mean, why?
To set you up as a suitable north-south armament?
And in general, why are you in jail?
No one called you here.
What's wrong with you?
I worried about you and I wouldn't have recognized anything
if I hadn't been called by the military.
The military?
Calm down.
The Fuhrer was very worried about you when he found out what had happened.

If you need help again, I'll get in touch with you.
Come to our store again!
Looks like you've been stolen, boy.
Why don't you buy a bouquet of flowers and catch up with her?
I know when to stop. Thank you.
If there is a woman who left you, she will find the one who will pick it up.
I have a message for you from Lieutenant General Milley Olivia Armstrong, Colonel Roy Mustang.
I guess I'll buy all the flowers in this cart.
The chain that tied them up takes on an unexpected form.
The guy who tore the chains and threw them away.
Doesn't he touch the face of the enemy?
Next time on Metal Alchemist, episode 37,
The first homunculus.
Trickery and blackmail.
Here are the means by which he achieves his goal.
