Episode forty-seventh, Vestnik of Emptiness.
Excuse me, is this Kanama?
Osan,
I have a visitor for you.
You've come after all, Eduard.
What a pleasant feeling!
How do you greet your father?
Wasn't it necessary to beat the right one?
I see you have friends.
We're just going to have a chat.
By the way, I'm their boss.
Well, well.
Thank you for watching over my sons.
Well, well.
Such a noisy snot is almost pulling me.
Shut up!
You have an interesting tattoo.
Ah, this one.
I think I have no reason to hide it.
You'd better hide it too.
You'd better be honest with us, dad.
Tomorrow is the day of the promise, right?
Yes.
I'll tell you everything.
I don't think you'll be able to make up with it as quickly as Alphonse.
Does Al know that?
Yes.
He had to rethink a lot, but he made up with the truth.
I'm a philosophical stone that you've been looking for all these years.
Do you want to use me?
You're in your own mind?
This is the life of innocent people.
We have become so stupid.
We have become so stupid, and we have no right to use them.
I'm glad you said that, son.
Tomorrow there will be a solar eclipse.
He wants to take advantage of this.
Take advantage of the eclipse?
Edward, will you help me stop him?
Help you?
Let's find out something.
I don't care.
I'll kick your ass with you or without you.
But we will have more chances with such an ally as you.
And this is the only reason I'm here.
I'm glad that no matter what, we will fight together.
Grandma Pinaka asked me to tell you the last words of my mother.
I'm sorry I couldn't keep my promise.
I'm leaving first.
I told you to...
Why don't you be a little softer with your old man?
That's it.
At least call him dad.
I understand that a lot has happened between you.
But he doesn't look like a person who could give up his wife so easily.
Yes, so much has happened.
Maybe you can tell us?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Maybe you can tell us?
Enough of me, your mother!
Yes, a lot has happened!
No way!
Well, he's whining again.
You can't get over it, can you?
I can understand you.
He turned out to be a philosophical stone in the shape of a man.
And not just a man, but your father.
That's not all.
I saw him from a new side that I hadn't noticed before.
One day I'll turn into a monster too.
With a wrinkled old bark.
But you know, it doesn't matter how we look.
I want us to keep smiling and taking pictures as a family.
Please, always be a part of this family.
Trisha, I'm leaving.
Please wait for me.
Okay.
I'll be waiting.
I'm sorry I couldn't keep my promise.
I'm leaving first.
We couldn't grow old together and die together.
But you believed until the end that one day I would follow you.
Soon, Trisha.
Soon.
Soon.
Please.
Thank you.
What do you need it for?
Again this tasteless red coat?
What is this red color?
Maybe it's the same color as Trisha.
The next battle may be the last one for me.
I have to stay in good shape.
Guys, you have no reason to go on with us.
I think it will be better for you if we part here.
I'm sorry, of course, but here I decide everything, not you.
Do you want to return your old bodies too?
How do you know?
Being a chemist is pretty good.
I think I wouldn't refuse to stay like this forever.
This is a real spirit.
But why?
You see, we have nowhere else to go.
My animal instinct says that it will be safer to stay with you.
I see.
And what about you?
Didn't you say that you can no longer fall into the eyes of other homunculi?
Do you want to know why I'm going back to the capital?
It's a secret.
What is it?
Al!
Oh my God, you scared me so much!
You're finally back!
How are you?
I'm glad you're all right, brother.
I thought you were with Major Miles now.
They're all right.
I have to show you something.
Can you come with me?
Of course.
Al, are you sure you're all right?
What?
Well, it just seemed to me...
Ed!
Link, get away from him!
He...
No!
What the hell?
So now you're with them, Greed?
Greed...
And you let someone control you?
Your soul is too weak!

The Fuhrer is still listed as missing.
So far, we have managed to find the body of only one of his people.
A miracle should have happened for someone to survive.
And yet, I personally headed the rescue squad and ordered the Northern Army to act.
But why, sir?
I will not calm down until I see his body with my own eyes.
Are we going to stick to the original plan of the attack on the capital?
Not yet.
We will give all the dirty work to Colonel Mustang.
Until now, Bradley's work in the administration has not caused any complaints.
But when Mustang and Lieutenant-General Armstrong speak against him,
it will look like betrayal.
If everything goes well, the officials and the public will spit on it.
And when they spit, I will make my move.
A glorious hero will appear on the stage, Colonel-General Grumman.
Without taking any risks, I will be able to seize power,
allowing the young to rub their hands.
It seems that this old monster has come up with something.
Before the beginning of that day, we had to unite the troops.
But I have to stay in check until the very end.
Al!
It's Pride.
Pride?
Yes.
He's like my older brother.
Gamun-Kul?
Your betrayal has no end, Grid.
Now you are just another obstacle on our way.
Damn you!
How did you find us?
How did you dare to pretend to be Al?
I didn't pretend to them.
This is your brother.
You son of a bitch!
I came here to destroy Grid.
And you will go with me.
Hey, guys, get out of here!
Hey, it hurts, you're fast!
Our style says, stay away from this creature!
Are you all right?
Yes!
Al and I need them alive, they won't kill us.
But I'm evil as hell right now.
So get ready, bitch.
And I can't kill you.
But nothing prevents me from cutting off a couple of extra limbs.
You can't let him get closer to the city.
I can't let him get close to the city.
I can't let him get close to the city.
Just a little bit more.
Now I have your friend.
Maybe you can start to listen to me, if the people of these slums join him.
Come on, he hit your weakest spot.
I can't always lose.
I can't always lose.
What is it?
Turn off the light, what happened?
I don't see anything.
But these eyes are gone.
It's you, Hankel.
What? What happened?
The shadow appears only when there is light.
We can't see anything in the dark.
But this also applies to the eyes of Pride.
So he's gone?
No, he's waiting.
As soon as the light appears, he'll come back.
What should we do?
Hankel, have you seen the shadow of Alphonse?
Oh, of course, these things look like a tent.
No, there was a huge shadow right behind him.
The real body of Pride is hiding somewhere in the shade of trees.
The real body?
So he's not inside the armor?
No.
To move outside the tunnel, he uses a container.
Describe him.
No stars, no moons.
But in this darkness, they are also powerless.
We'll have to wait until the city restores its energy.
You won't get away.
You came to this world without hesitation.
You came to this form without hesitation.
Impressive.
I won't lie.
It's unpleasant to beat up what looks like a child.
But you know,
the beast inside me is constantly pouring me.
Kill him or die yourself.
Ed.
Ed.
Gorillus Sand?
How is he?
Looks like he didn't move out of place.
I didn't hear anything else, Liasga.
Great, now we'd better leave him here.
Leave Al alone?
I understand you're worried about him, but what if it's another trap?
We need to stick together until Heinkel deals with Pride,
so as not to accidentally attack each other.
That sound...
Do you think Gorillus Sand can handle that sound?
We have to believe in his instincts as a night predator.
Pride, how did you know we were here?
With your abilities, you couldn't find us.
Lie down!
Don't move!
I can smell a solid metal alchemist.
Grida!
That voice...
Is he here too?
Now it's clear.
Pride used the gulping smell to track us down.
I can also smell an unfamiliar smell.
Does that mean I can eat him?
It's up to you, Dorius.
He's also a homunculus.
And how am I supposed to fight this monster?
He only has a sense of smell.
So you're in equal conditions.
The animal instinct tells me to get the hell out of here.
Well, fuck him!
Good luck, brave fellow!
Take this!
It hurts, Gorillus Sand.
You said we had to stick together so we wouldn't hit each other.
I'm sorry.
If we leave everything as it is, we'll be eaten by the gulps.
If we turn on the light, Pride will come back.
Bad news.
Listen, Grida.
Link?
Link?
Change with me.
I can feel the homunculus.
I was the first to notice Pride.
It won't be easy to fight them in this darkness.
Damn it!
Don't you dare steal my body!
Steal? Who would steal a cow?
It's lunchtime!
Here you go!
Great throw.
Well done, partner.
Thank you.
Link?
He's the one.
Now I'm angry, I'm hungry.
But no one lets me eat myself.
So I'll just swallow you all.
This is bad.
What's bad?
Something is approaching.
What's there?
Such a familiar feeling.
What's there, guys?
I'm the only normal here, tell me!
What's there?
Bend down!
Another enemy?
I don't know.
I don't know, though.
This is...
I...
...remember this castle.
Glad you're back.
I missed you, Ren-Fan.
THE END
THE END
THE END
Can you sacrifice your friend for the sake of victory?
Of course.
