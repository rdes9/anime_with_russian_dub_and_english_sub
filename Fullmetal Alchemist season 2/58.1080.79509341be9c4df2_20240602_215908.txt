What the hell?
A familiar feeling...
Exactly!
I've already felt it when I opened the Gates of Truth!

Episode 58. Valuable Sacrifices
Damn it!
Son of a bitch!
You...
Idiot, leave me alone!
Young man, it's our duty to protect you!
Your self-defense will not withstand such gravity!
You'd better take care of yourself, old man!
It's too late!
Brix, help me!
Bradley, die!
Find a doctor!
Is there really no doctor who has alchemy here?
I have a philosophical stone!
Use at least all of his energy!
I'm begging you, at least someone!
After all, there are so many alchemists in this country!
Is there really not a single one here, huh?
How come?
Why?
Young man!
You monster!
I'm going to kill you!
I'm going to kill you!
I'm going to kill you!
You monster!
Why?
Even if I die, I can't save just one of my subjects!
Damn it!
Captain! Captain!
Hold on, captain!
Captain! Captain!
Captain!
Fire!
Thanks to your courage, we were able to mortally kill Bradley!
Thanks to you, the victim was not in vain!
And I can't repay you with anything!
Get more ammo!
That was the last ribbon!
Damn it!
We're out of ammo!
Fire with a gun!
Yes, sir!
D-Link, I'm...
Gilegrid...
It doesn't matter.
If you feel obligated, can you do me one favor?
This door...
Our queen ordered us to keep these gates shut and closed.
I'm going to kill you!
I'm going to kill you!
Our queen ordered us to keep these gates shut and closed.
I'm going to kill you!
Protect them!
With such power, can you defend them?
No.
Only you can do it.
Please.
I'm going to kill you!
I'm going to kill you!
Grid!
I need your power!
Lend it to me!
Okay, man.
We still have some time.
Renfan, take care of the rest.
Okay.
Will you do it for me?
Yes.
I give you my word.
And for the people of Xing...
The word is the law.
Fire!
What the hell?
Hey, bastards, listen to me!
Those of you who have a family at home and those who don't want to be colleagues, run!
And I don't fight with girls!
It's impossible!
Kill them!
Fire!
Amazing Lingyao!
Or Gamunko?
It's not good that he's on our side.
Captain! Captain!
Hold on, Captain!
Did he stop them?
Yes.
Well, now you can die with a light heart.
Don't say that, Captain!
General Armstrong is already a step away from victory!
Hold on a little longer!
Who else can do business in the capital?
I don't like the capital.
Farewell, brothers.
My time has come.
Climb even higher than the Brix Mountains.
Captain Bakanir!
What kind of a flash was that?
The military doesn't report anything.
What's going on in the headquarters?
Radio Capital didn't report anything else.
No.
What about the other stations?
We just want to observe the curfew.
Mom!
The radio said that no one is allowed to leave the house.
I'm afraid you won't be able to come to Tabeti-chan or the others today.
Oh, come on!
The curfew will be visible from here.
It will start soon.
Let's look at it together.

Izumi!
Where are you?
Izumi!
Alex, did you understand what happened?
The Elric brothers once told me
that when they transformed a person,
their black hands pulled them into the Gate of Truth.
What is the Gate of Truth?
I don't know.
What?
Did you establish a connection?
Yes, sir!
The command post is still under our control, General.
Good.
Is there any information about Izumi-san?
No.
I see.
Anything else?
Captain Bakanir and several soldiers under his command
defended the main gates.
They fell into battle with the King, Bradley.
They reported that the captain, along with a Ksing soldier,
was able to mortally injure Bradley and throw him into the river.
Nonsense!
It's nonsense! Nonsense! Nonsense!
King Bradley couldn't have died so easily!
He's a superhuman!
What about the main gates?
We held them back.
The homunculus grid has moved to our side
and is holding down the central troops
attacking the main gates.
Homunculus?
Nonsense!
Not a single homunculus will go against him!
Also, Captain Bakanir left with a smile on his face.
I see.
If he met death with a smile,
we wouldn't have had to shed tears.
Let's move on.
Yes, sir!
Let's go, Zig-Zag.
We need to find your wife.
Yes.
Sensei!
Hello.
Are you all right?
Well, I guess so.
How did you get here, Sensei?
I'd like to know myself.
By the way, where are we?
I have no idea.
Something moved me here.
What's going on?
What's going on?
What's going on?
I have no idea.
Something moved me here.
Al!
Hey, Al!
Al's here too.
Get up, Al!
Are they really collecting all the valuable victims?
One, two, three...
Four...
One's not enough.
I think he'll join us soon.
What's this nonsense?
This monster is...
Hoenheim!
Edward.
Did Alphonse catch you too?
And you, Izumi-san?
I'm sorry to introduce you in this form.
What happened to you?
Well, it just so happened that...
Sit still.
I'll take care of taking your stone a little later.
Hoenheim, who is this blind bastard?
I'm the second one.
The one who is called father by homunculus.
Go to hell!
There's a bearded haze here?
Yes.
I was able to destroy his container, but...
I didn't give you the word Hoenheim.
So, I greet you, my precious victims.
Welcome to my monastery.
Get up, Al!
We've had enough.
Al!
Hey, Al!
Alphonse!
Oh my god, these bastards are useless.
They couldn't prepare 5 victims for us for this day.
Although...
What else could we expect from the Shavaks,
who are so cheaply deceived as if they were immortal?
How are you?
Great, keep it like that.
We don't have much time, Mustang-kun.
I hope you won't refuse to help me.
Be kind, transform the man and open the gate.
What?
It doesn't matter who you choose.
The deceased parents, your beloved friend...
Exactly, your best friend.
What was his name?
Hius-kun.
He's just right for you.
It doesn't matter, I'll prepare everything I need.
To make me a precious victim?
That's right.
Those who open the gate become precious victims.
So that's why you chose the Felric brothers?
Yes.
They told me that it is impossible to resurrect the dead.
Only a fool will be beaten with a hammer against the wall, which he will never break.
Indeed.
But all you need is to open the gate and come back.
Fuck you!
I will not transform a man, let alone open the gate!
Didn't I tell you?
We don't have much time.
Lieutenant!
Lieutenant!
Lieutenant!
So, will you open the gate, Mustang-kun?
Asshole!
Lieutenant, do you hear me?
Say something!
Transform the man and become the fifth victim.
Well, if you don't hurry, she'll die.
I think I understand.
Do you want to transform this girl?
Will she suit you too?
I will not die.
After all, I was ordered to survive.
It is enough to be a simple order to obtain immortality.
Everyone would live forever.
So, what did you decide, Mustang-kun?
Dear man, you are on the verge of death.
If you don't do anything, she will die of blood loss.
It turned out that I have medical alchemy.
And I have a philosophical stone.
In other words, I can save her life.
But if she dies before you make a decision, even I will be powerless.
Oh...
Something is wrong with her.
I'm afraid she didn't die.
Colonel, don't you dare transform a man.
You know what to do, Mustang-kun.
Yes?
I understand.
