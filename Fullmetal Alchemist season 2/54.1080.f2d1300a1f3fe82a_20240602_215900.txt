The End of Ishvarsk Company, 1909
Let's go. Otherwise everyone will leave without us.
Your comrade?
No, Ishvarsky's child.
He was shot and thrown on the side of the road.
Let's go home. The war is over.
But the Ishvarsk battle is still going on inside me.
And most likely it will never end.
After all, I believed in you. I opened my father's research to you.
I decided to go to the military academy myself, hoping to bring happiness to people.
And now, when it's all over, I can't run away from the truth.
I can't atone for my sins.
I beg you, Mustang-san.
Please, burn what's on my back.
I won't do anything. Listen to me.
The past can't be returned, but the secret hidden on my back shouldn't be used again.
I won't let another fiery alchemist be born.
Will you help me?
Save me from this damned seal.
Only then will I break the bonds that bind me to my father.
The bonds that bind me to alchemy.
Please.
Okay.
My flame won't leave a trace of them.
Thank you, Mustang-san.
A solid metal alchemist.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Okay, here you go.
I'm sorry
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Uncle and Lieutenant.
So you two...
I was kidding.
Thank you for getting involved in this, Envy.
And now do me a favor.
Die!
It hurts!
Fuck you!
Don't forget to look under your feet!
Colonel will bite you!
Colonel?
How dare you attack my subordinate?
No more self-defense, Lieutenant.
I said I would kill him with my own hands.
No more self-defense, Lieutenant.
I said I would kill him with my own hands.
Fuck you!
Don't forget to look under your feet!
No more self-defense, Lieutenant.
I said I would kill him with my own hands.
No more self-defense, Lieutenant.
I said I would kill him with my own hands.
No more self-defense, Lieutenant.
Fuck!
And more!
Oh no!
Oh!
So this is your true form.
Disgusting.
Now I understand why you were named Envy.
So this is your true form.
Disgusting.
So this is your true form.
Envy.
So this is your true form.
You must be..
Are you sure?
No!
Stop!
Jealousy is truly the most disgusting of feelings!
I don't want to die!
No!
Go!
No!
Bat!
What's the matter, Lieutenant?
Enough, Colonel!
I'll finish it myself!
One more hit and he'll die!
Put the gun down!
I'm afraid I can't do it!
Please take off your gloves!
No, damn it! Put the gun down!
A solid metal one!
Give it to me!
Are you deaf?
Give it to me!
You can do it!
He's waiting for a slow and painful death!
No!
Give it to me!
Or I'll burn this guy with my own hands!
Come on, moron, let's see who's who!
But first, look at your overgrown face!
Do you really think that its owner can stand at the head of the country?
Have you really forgotten your goal, Colonel?
They will protect those who are dear to them.
A small man is capable of this.
Sounds interesting!
I'm in the business too!
I want to see how your childhood ideals will change this country.
Or will you allow the rage to turn you into an animal?
The choice is yours!
I will not interfere with the person who is being punished!
Hey! When it comes to revenge, I have no right to interfere!
But I can imagine how the world ends, which the beast will rule in human form!
I will not let you kill Envy, Colonel!
But I will not let him stay alive!
I will finish him myself!
I've been waiting so long!
And finally he's in my hands!
I understand!
But!
What you want to do will not save the country and will not return our comrade!
By killing him, you will only allow hatred to take over you!
Stop! It's not too late!
If you're going to shoot forward...
What are you going to do after you kill me?
I'm not going to lead a quiet life alone.
When the battle is over, I will leave this world with the remains of a bonfire.
This is unacceptable!
I can't lose you yet!
How did I end up here?
I don't know!
I don't know!
I don't know!
I don't know!
I don't know!
How did I end up here?
I made the child angry.
I listen to the enemy's teachings.
I made you go through this.
I'm such an idiot!
I'm sorry.
What nonsense is this?
What is this radio show?
I'm sick of you!
How can you people obey emotions?
Listen to your instinct!
Mustang, have you really forgotten?
Scar tried to kill you!
And you, Fasolin, do you remember?
Scar killed your parents and your girlfriend.
And the girl from the eastern city who was turned into Chimera...
Your new friend also killed her.
And you, Scar...
The people whose hands are stained in the blood of your brothers and sisters are standing here.
And this woman...
Then she sent many to that world and got the nickname of the eye of the falcon.
There will be no other chance.
Come on!
Take advantage of them!
Cry, hate and tear each other to pieces!
Cry, hate and tear each other to pieces!
Damn it!
You are such a piece of shit!
They will forget the past and start working together!
Am I right, shrimp?
Ahoukai! Mustang!
Scar!
Why?
Why?
Explain to me!
Why?
Why?
Why?
What the hell?
Envy...
You just envy people.
Let us be weaker than you, homunculus.
But even when we are defeated, cornered and on the verge of death...
We rise again and again.
And when we run out of strength, friends will reach out to us.
That's why you envy us.
Having brought the victim a pawn, you can save something more.
Don't you really understand this?
You can't shoot a person.
That's why you are so weak people.
Since I can change my appearance, it's better to be young and beautiful.
People are so stupid.
They are ready to give their lives for the sake of such nonsense, which should be expected from people.
People...
People...
Hey, where are you going?
Calm down, you moron!
Tie me up with this or...
Wait!
Wait!
Wait!
He won't last long anyway.
How humiliating!
I have turned to you in this pathetic form.
And you will also laugh at me for a piece of shit.
And you will also laugh at me for a piece of shit.
And you will also laugh at me for a piece of shit.
And you will also laugh at me for a piece of shit.
And you will also laugh at me for a piece of shit.
And you will also laugh at me for a piece of shit.
And you will also laugh at me for a piece of shit.
And you will also laugh at me for a piece of shit.
And you will also laugh at me for a piece of shit.
And you will also laugh at me for a piece of shit.
And you will also laugh at me for a piece of shit.
And you will also laugh at me for a piece of shit.
And you will also laugh at me for a piece of shit.
And you will also laugh at me for a piece of shit.

What a shame to be understood by a girl like you.
I wonder how far this primitive view of the world will take you.
Do your best!
Good luck, Edward Elric.
You escaped again.
You cowardly bitch!

His wounds are stretched out.
What a monster!
What the hell is this?
Help us in time!
Help you?
We have an order to eliminate Lieutenant General Armstrong.
General ... Major is also here.
Just in time, you are going under my command.
Help us deal with them!
What the hell is this?
Come on, come on!
Bullets are scary to me!
Crush their skulls!
So at least they will not eat us alive!
Attack each of them in groups!
Show me what you are worth, capital pussies!
Yes, ma'am!
What? Where am I?
Oh, now I remember!
Kill the General's wife!
Not so fast!
You're in the way!
It's hard to fight with one hand!
Major!
General!
General!
Major!
General!
He will be beaten to death!
We need to help Major!
Forget about him!
My brother is strong enough to withstand a couple of such slaps!
That's it!
Major!
Major!
The shoulder is back in place!
Great!
No!
The result of the fusion of the power of my magnificent body and my inspiring alchemy is a bubble!
Yes, in the place of Armstrong is empty.
God damn it, it means that they kept the tank here.
The guard from the central gates says, contact me with the headquarters commander, we were attacked by enemy armored vehicles.
Commander, answer me!
Enough talking, I already see everything.
Open fire!
But we haven't finished evacuating the civilians yet.
If we lose the central gates slowly, call the commander of the main battery.
What the hell is this?
You ordered to shoot at the residential areas?
We will also pass this on the radio.
Who are you?
It's the equipment, Briggs!
How did you get here?
Ah, we have a guy with brilliant memory who used to work in the central headquarters.
He remembers the location of the commander's office perfectly.
It remains only to dig a tunnel here from the sleeping areas of the city.
Who the hell is capable of this?
We have one person.
Who?
When someone asks me, I usually answer the housekeeper.
This is a polite answer.
But today I want to boast, so I will say that I am an alchemist.
You are alone?
I thought the boys would come with you.
Why should I lead a big company that is not capable of fighting?
I'm not a big company.
I'm a big company.
I'm a big company.
I'm a big company.
I'm a big company.
I'm a big company.
I'm a big company.
I'm a big company.
We need to lead a big company to punish one spoiled child.
My little checkmate.
RAB-23, you once gave me some of your body.
This time you will become my happiness.
The continuation follows.
What are you going to do now, people?
What is waiting for you ahead?
Can you fix everything yet?
Next, in the metal alchemist goal, episode 55, the old guard.
Squeeze your will into your fist and get up from your knees.
