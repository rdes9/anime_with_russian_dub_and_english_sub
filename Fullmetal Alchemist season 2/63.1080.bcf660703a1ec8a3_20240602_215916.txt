Or do you want to be a slave till the end of your life?
Don't you even have your own will?
Such existence is nothing different from mine in the test room.
The purpose of the metal alchemist.
Episode 63. The other side of the gate.
Why?
Yes, wet him, Ed!
Because I command the power of God himself!
How can an alchemist, a pathetic man, overcome me with bare hands?
I can't believe it!
I can't believe it!
You...
It worked! He did it! He won!
Hold on!
Where are you going? I'm sorry!
Stone...
Philosopher's Stone!
Give me your stone!
This is shit!
This is shit, Greed!
You idiot, let me go!
You'll get caught too!
I refuse!
I can't become the Emperor of Xing without you!
It's useless!
From the very beginning I was a part of the body of an old man!
My connection with him is much stronger than with you, Ling Yao!
I can't resist him!
Don't you dare give up, Greed! Fight!
Damn!
Damn!
My body!
Damn!
Emperor Xing is certainly not the Pope of the Earth, but everything is better than nothing!
Let's kick his ass together, partner!
This is another...
What are you...
I won't forgive you!
I won't let the old man take your soul too!
Stop, Greed!
You said we would fight together!
I'll let it end like this!
Didn't you always say you'd never lie?
And now...
Did you believe me?
Greed...
I lied to you the first and last time!
Ren Fan has a Philosopher's Stone!
Take it and go home!
No!
Don't!
Don't you dare, Greed!
Ren Fan, come on!
Leave!
Greed!
Greed!
Greed, come on!
Finally, I got out of this boy's body!
Greed, why don't you obey me?
Is this the age of transition, father?
I will take advantage of the power over the carbon you gave me
and make your body fragile like wood coal!
What an unbearable child!
Get lost, fool!
Greed!
Damn, it looks like it's the end!
Don't look at me with such pity, boy!
The souls of Nakama and their fates are entwined together!
You'll forget it in two!
Do you want to join us?
If you have nowhere else to go, let's go with us!
Damn you, shrimp, and you, Link!
You always talked to me as if you knew everything in the world!
Enough!
Yes, that's enough!
I don't need anything else!
Farewell, friends!
The End
They are free!
Stone! My Philosopher's Stone!
What is this?
Go back to where you came from!
The creature from the test tube, Gamunko!
Why? I just wanted to conquer this world!
I wanted to get rid of the path and become free!
Me!
Why?
Why couldn't I get everything?
Answer me! God!
Because you don't believe!
Did you really think that by stealing something valuable, you would become who it belonged to?
What kind of god are you?
You only used other people's power, and you didn't develop yourself!
Did you really think that you would surpass people only by getting rid of seven sins?
Don't make fun of me!
I wanted to become a perfect creature!
I just wanted to conquer this world!
Why did you get on my path?
Why didn't my wishes come true?
Why didn't you let my dream come true?
Who?
Who are you?
Answer me!
What are you?
Sometimes I am called the world, sometimes the universe, sometimes the god, sometimes the truth.
I am everything, and I am one.
And I am also you!
The truth is given to you by due despair for pride.
Each of you has suffered a deserved punishment that has put his pride in place.
This is the truth.
Now it's your turn to know despair.
I don't want to go back there! No!
I beg you!
I don't want to go back there!
No! No! No!
Due to due despair.
What can I do to make you forgive me?
This is the end you've always wanted.
What can I do to make you forgive me?
You know the answer to this question yourself.
What? What's going on?
We won?
Yes, but...
Alphonse Kuhn stayed there.
I'm sorry.
Me.
It's not your fault.
Al made the choice himself.
We have an entrance fee.
Take this philosophical stone.
And give it back to me.
I can't.
We promised each other not to use the stone to return to our bodies.
There must be an exit.
Think.
Think!
Think, damn it!
Edward.
I'm using my life to get Alphonse back.
I just have one soul left.
Forget about it, idiot!
We paid with our bodies for our own stupidity.
I'm tired of repeating.
We won't use other people's lives to correct our mistake.
And what did you decide to sacrifice yourself for?
Because I'm your father.
Do you need other reasons?
For me, no one is more important than you.
And I want you to be happy.
I left you, and this is my answer to what happened to you.
Forgive me.
I lived long enough.
And I want to do what is right for a real father.
You're the dumbest father in the world, dad!
Stop talking nonsense, or you'll get me too!
I'm sorry, Edward.
Think!
Think!
I became the youngest state alchemist!
I saw the truth and I can transform without a circle!
I have to!
I have to!
I have to!
I have to!
Come back to your old bodies.
Many people are impatiently waiting for this.
I just listed the options, and the choice is yours.
Exactly.
You can't give up.
There must be something.
Something!
Something!
Something!
Something!
Something!
Something!
I must!
I must!
Something!
Something!
Alasama!
Alasama!
Alasama!
Are you crying because of Alla?
Zanpanna, Gorillus-san, the guys from Bricks, Major, Link, Renfan, Sensei, Papa...
Mei, get away!
What?
Zanpanna, Gorillus-san, the guys from Bricks, Major, Link, Renfan, Sensei, Papa...
This is...
...a circle for human transformation!
I'll go there and back!
This is the last transformation of the goal of metal allochemistry!
Ed!
Ed! Edward Elric!
Sounded for free on the site www.anidab.com
I came for my brother...
And how do you expect to take a whole person from here?
What are you going to pay?
Are you going to stay here instead of him?
Here's my fee!
It's enough!
I give back the Gates of Truth!
After all, they are also part of me!
Isn't that right?
That's how it is!
But you thought well!
Having lost the Gates of Truth, you will never be able to use alchemy again!
Of course!
The power of alchemy is hidden behind these Gates!
But our weakness is hidden in them!
Seeing the truth, it seems to us that alchemy is omnipotent!
But in fact...
We are blinded by pride!
You are ready to part with the power of alchemy and become an ordinary person again!
And I never stopped being...
A weak person who could not save an unfortunate girl turned into a chimera!
There will be no going back!
You will not regret!
Ed!
Allochemistry!
Edward Kuhn!
Ed! Edward Elric!
Ed! Edward Sun!
Ed!
Ed!
I have friends, and they are much more important than alchemy!
Good answer, alchemist!
You put the truth behind it!
Take your prize!
The exit is there, Edward Elric!
Just look at who you look like!
Me!
Are we coming back together?
Yes?
He woke up!
How are you, Alphonse?
Zanpanna-san?
Darius-san?
Guys!
Dad!
I'm back!
Yes!
Thank you!
It's so warm!
Alasama!
Alphonse-sama!
May!
I'm so... I'm so...
I see...
I'm sorry to have made you worry.
Thank you, May!
Radio Capital speaking.
Today our troops under the command of Lieutenant-General Armstrong and Colonel Mustang
carried out an operation to disarm the group of traitors from the Supreme Command,
who tried to sacrifice the civilian population of the country for the sake of the devilish experiment with alchemy.
Two leaders of the traitors, General-Major Clemen and General-Major Edison,
were killed in the operation.
Two leaders of the traitors, General-Major Clemen and General-Major Edison,
were able to be taken alive.
The soldiers who were under their direct command were disarmed.
We report with regret that during the riots,
the unchangeable leader of our country, FÃ¼hrer King Bradley and his son Selim Bradley, died.
Colonel Mustang took over the Supreme Command at this difficult time for us.
He makes every effort to restore order in the country as soon as possible.
You gave me your blood.
Don't you dream of freedom, Hohenheim?
What would make you happy?
Let me think.
Maybe I'm asking too much,
but if I had the opportunity to leave this test, I would be happy.
Yes, my friend from the test, Kamunkul.
You were actually born from my blood.
I...
Hohenheim was given to them.
Your sons have already been taken to the hospital.
Thank you for taking care of them.
Well, should I thank you?
If not for Edward and Alphonse, our country would have been destroyed.
Take my gratitude.
Thank you.
THE END
I'm back, Trisha.
Edward still called me dad.
Although he said that I was the dumbest father in the world.
To live longer than other people is not a gift, it's a curse.
But fate brought me together with you and gave me two wonderful sons.
Life turned out to be good.
Yes, you won't wish for more.
Thank you for everything, Trisha.
Well, now I even want to die.
What kind of coward am I after all?
Hohenheim!
Here you are!
What a fool!
It's a pity I didn't see you so happy while you were alive.
THE END
THE END
THE END
THE END
THE END
