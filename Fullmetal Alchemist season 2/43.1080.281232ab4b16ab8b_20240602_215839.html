        <pre>Where are you, comrade Kimbley?
What does it all mean?
You promised to make a diversion in Rixie when we start the stop-lanes.
What?
What?
What?
What?
What?
What?
What?
What?
What?
What?
No!
Stop the fire!
Absolute victory!
Yes!
This is it!
Bloody seal!
Sennometallic Alchemist
How many times do I have to tell you that you have to feel the blood running through the veins of a dragon to use the Ren Tanjitsu?
I'm telling you, I don't understand what that means.
Concentrate on your feelings and...
Shanghai?
I can't do it!
No, you can.
I need theory, not some sounds.
What are you afraid of, guys?
I'm sorry to have disturbed you.
I'm sorry to have disturbed you.
I'm sorry to have disturbed you.
I'm sorry to have disturbed you.
I'm sorry to have disturbed you.
I'm sorry to have disturbed you.
Don't worry.
You've helped us a lot, too.
Don't touch my hair!
And there are children who can play with it.
Tell Zanpano that we went up to get the firewood.
Tell Zanpano that we went up to get the firewood.
Damn it!
It's terrible!
Where did this Zanpano go?
Everyone except him works!
Hey!
Come on, I'll take you.
I'm counting on you, Zanpano.
Episode 43, Insect Bite
So, you already know about Selim?
So, you already know about Selim?
Yes.
And about my origin?
Yes.
And about my origin?
Yes.
I wonder what the ordinary citizen feels
when he finds out that the ruler of the country
and his son are homunculi?
I'm very sad that the people
we believed in turned out to be fake.
I'm very sad that the people we believed in turned out to be fake.
Your family is just a game.
Pretending to be human, you were making fun of the fools
who bought this deception.
I was given a son so that my game would look natural.
I was given a son so that my game would look natural.
I got the power of the subordinates and the seat of the Fuhrer.
I got the power of the subordinates and the seat of the Fuhrer.
The whole state is my game.
Nevertheless, I chose my wife myself.
The tea is ready.
The tea is ready.
Yes.
It's amazing.
By the way, doctor,
you were a big bump in the fifth research laboratory.
You were a big bump in the fifth research laboratory.
You were a big bump in the fifth research laboratory.
I just had a few subordinates.
I just had a few subordinates.
I wonder how they are there.
I wonder how they are there.
Hey!
Who is it?
I met him this morning.
I met him this morning.
He asked you to examine him.
Relax, Zanpano.
Finish this performance.
Hello, doctor.
Hello, doctor.
What the hell are you doing here?
What the hell are you doing here?
Do you really think that such a useless insect
will be able to escape from us?
Do you really think that such a useless insect will be able to escape from us?
What the hell?
What the hell?
Zanpano!
Zanpano!
Well, now my performance is over.
Well, now my performance is over.
Why didn't you tell me you were all promised?
Why didn't you tell me you were all promised?
Don't you know?
I don't know, but one day I can't contact you anymore,
so that you know I'm really alive?
Don't you know?
Inada!
Zanpano, don't worry about that.
I'll just destroy you all!
There are transformers hiding everywhere,
that act like a mine,
and in that alchemism it's just a lump!
But if it's Nina, I'm just going to follow your footsteps.
What the hell?
They only react to homunculi.
And thanks to the snowfall, you never know where they are.
Well, what is it like to be a toy in the hands of such pathetic insects as us?
He doesn't even realize that this is just a regular transformation at a distance.
What the hell? Who allowed you to talk to me like that?
You tiny rats, what have you done to yourself?
Doctor!
What the hell? Who allowed you to talk to me like that?
You tiny rats, what have you done to yourself?
Just a little bit more.
Thank you.
This fat bastard is fast.
Insects can also be stingy.
Stupid people.
Your weak attacks won't stop me.
Really?
Let's see how you like this.
AAAAAAAAHHHH!
Ready?
Haha! Got you!
Doctor!
Easy, easy, boys. Otherwise I'll break his neck.
And now it's time to teach you a lesson.
Do you remember what I said, Doc?
If you try to throw something out, I'll wipe this city from the face of the earth.
I won't let you!
You're still resisting, you fool.
Yeah, first I'll destroy these slugs down there.
Don't you dare.
Although just destroying them won't be too fun.
I'll choose the cutest kids there and take them to the capital to make another philosophical stone.
You bastards, are you still creating them?
Let the scientists go, free my people!
What? Let them go? Well, that's unlikely.
After all, they have already become a philosophical stone.
Even the most beautiful people in the world are the most beautiful.
Even my subordinates.
What? Didn't I tell you?
Why are you so upset, Doc?
During these years, you have created an innumerable number of stones.
Using human lives.
Yes.
By creating these damn stones, I have sacrificed a lot of people.
That's why I know more about stones than anyone else in this country.
And if you can create something, you can destroy it.

What is it?
Doctor went there, didn't he?
It hurts! It hurts! It hurts!
No!
Why?
No, it can't be!
Like me, Envy!
I can die from such pathetic insects!
Some kind of hemorrhoids!
Don't look at me like that!
Don't look! Don't you dare look at me from above, people!
Don't look at me, insects!
Don't you dare look at me from above, people!
And all this time, we were manipulated by such a pathetic creature!
Marco, we won!
Oh, they're coming back!
Marco, what happened to you?
What's this?
Oh, well. You turned it around and didn't even warn us.
You'll know how to deal with people.
Marco, why did you take such a risk?
All my life I have obediently obeyed all their orders.
Now I will act as my heart tells me to.
Think with your own head and make your own decisions.
How are your parents doing?
Just be careful next time.
Yes!
Yoki-san!
Help me!
I'll borrow the body of this loser!
Oh, get away from me, monster!
The body doesn't listen to me!
Flutter as much as you want!
Now I'm here, the main thing is his life in my hands!
Well, do whatever you want with him.
He's not a friend to us.
Yoki-san, let us both know each other.
We won't forget you.
It's a scar. We're friends, right?
Don't turn away from me, traitor!
Why? I was sure he was your comrade.
Don't test your fate, En.
I'm not your comrade.
Don't get in my way.
I'll try to throw something out and we'll both destroy you.
Motherfucker!
He's mine, right?
Well played.
I thought my heart would stop.
You're a real monster, we're not friends anymore.
I don't want to have anything to do with you.
I don't want to be friends with you.
I don't want to be friends with you.
I don't want to have anything to do with you.
Shit.
Now tell us what you came up with.
I don't know anything.
I don't get it.
They brought me, a pair of thugs.
Come on, kill him, Zanpano.
You're an imbecile.
Who will say when they know that he will be killed anyway?
Oh, you.
By the way, where is the whole metal embassy?
Brother?
He's probably already in Rix.
Yeah.
And I heard that he's gone.
What's wrong with him? What did you do? Tell me!
It seems that a mine has collapsed in Basel.
I don't know if he's still alive.
No, it can't be.
No way.
What are we going to do?
Let's go back to the base.
No, if he were in our place, he would not doubt that we are whole and would continue to move forward.
So we shouldn't stop either.
Yes.
We still have hope.
I have to leave you for a while.
Recently, I realized something important for myself.
For many years I hated the country that rejected the people of Shvar, but now I want to change it.
And for this I will need your help, Mark.
Of course, I will go with you.
In order to change this country, I also need to visit one city.
What city?
It's called Lior.
There is also a tunnel under it.
And there we will be able to destroy it.
May, take it and go home.
What?
This creature survived after it was killed dozens of times.
Perhaps this will save your clan.
But if I leave, you will not be able to use Rintanjitsu.
It's not the time for you to think about someone else's country.
Or have you already forgotten why you came here?
What will you say to the people who are waiting for you if you lose your time here?
I'm sorry, I couldn't help you because I was too busy saving Amestris.
Go.
Go, the people of this country will cope with their problems themselves.
Thank you very much.
Take care of yourself, May.
When I learn the basics of Rintanjitsu, I will come to you to study further.
Al-sama.
Al-sama.
I... I love...
Thank you all.
Goodbye.
Take care of yourself.
She's gone.
We also have to go.
Of course.
Gritsan
Gritsan.
Nothing.
Izumi Curtis went on vacation with her husband, and this guy has no idea when she will be back.
This is bad.
It remains only to return and report to the Fuhrer Bradley.
Bradley?
You will go with me, Grit.
We need to be replaced.
Yes.
They will bring me to Gritsan.
But...
It won't help you to do this.
Could you leave my foot, sis?
The Bricks' garrison has defeated the Drachma's army in the days to come!
Of course!
So, the Underground Transforming Circle is ready?
No idea.
Our task is to protect the country from external threats,
to instill fear in the enemy so that they have no idea how to attack us,
and those who dare to do so must be wiped off the face of the Earth!
Well, Ino, you're so cruel!
No one will want to take you in the wife if you go on like this!
You don't even have a spirit of a warrior!
I'd better get out of here before I get infected with your cowardice!
Oh, where are you, General?
Your brother?
I don't even want to think about it!
He's a coward who ran away from Ishvara, shedding tears!
Please follow me, you must see something!
Do you know about the state alchemists?
Yes, not creating gold, not creating people and not protecting the army.
That's right.
The last prohibition speaks for itself.
The prohibition on the creation of gold is needed to support a stable economy.
But why can't you create people?
Why did the state prohibit human transformation?
Why did the state prohibit human transformation?
From the mind and morals?
After all, creating such people plays God.
For centuries, this is the main taboo of alchemy.
You're wrong.
Each generation and each particular person have their own morals.
The answer is simple.
This rule is necessary so that no one can create their own army, General.
I'm sorry, General.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
We're going to burn in heaven!
The whole city is destroyed?
Is there any way to eat here?
Wait, maybe it is somewhere in here.
Ah, Rose, thank you for seeing me!
How have you been?
Ah, thank you.
They know each other?
Yeah, I think so.
And where is Ed?
Isn't he with you?
Well, the brother is now in another place.
It's a shame, I really wanted to see him again.
So-so.
What?
Nothing, just you had such a strange expression on your face, as if ...
Don't talk nonsense.
Hey Rose, the pan is washed.
What else can I ...
Resurrection, rebirth and the decision made.
It's time for the heart to be filled with new strength.
After all, in order to live, a person must move forward.
No matter how hard this path is.
Next time, in the purpose of the metal alchemist, episode forty-four,
I will show you how to do it.
Wake up people, otherwise it will be too late.
