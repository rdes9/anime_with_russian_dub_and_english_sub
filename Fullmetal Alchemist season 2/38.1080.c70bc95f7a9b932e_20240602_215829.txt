Yes?
Good evening!
This is your favourite florist.
Ah...
What kind of a joke it was, Colonel?
Oh, sorry.
I've been drinking and buying a whole cart of flowers.
I'll be very grateful if you'll help me get rid of them.
What is it?
What's wrong?
Did something happen?
So?
No.
Nothing.
Really?
Yes.
Absolutely nothing.
I don't need flowers.
I don't have a single vase anyway.
Thank you for calling me, colonel.
Good night.
And how does he manage to choose the time so successfully?

The man of our similar frame was seen on the mountain roads not far from here.
He must have been heading here.
Abandoned mine?
Yes.
This is Bazzill, the ghost town.
A suitable place to hide?
It will be difficult to find him, so we should split up.
All units, report to us as soon as you discover the scar.
Yes, sir.
Elric brothers, we will go with you.
Yes, yes.
I think they are here on purpose to keep an eye on us.
Looks like it.
Episode 38, battle in Bazzill.
So...
How can we get rid of them?
Ah, there is someone's shadow!
What?
Come here!
Hey, wait!
Stop!
They disappeared?
Did they not come in here?
Damn!
Where did they go?
It looks like we got rid of them.
But...
This place...
is damn huge!
Scars can be found anywhere.
We can't find them if they don't come here themselves.
Alphonse herself!
Alphonse herself!
Hey!
It can't be!
Alphonse herself!
She really came!
What are you doing here?
May, thank God, we found you!
Alphonse, did you really look for me?
Yes, I wanted to meet you.
Alphonse!
I wanted to meet you so that you could tell us about Arian Tanjutsu.
Oh, God, it's not Sol. Alphonse himself was looking for me.
Oh, God!
Hey, little girl!
I was looking for you!
I won't let you escape anymore!
Give us all of Arian Tanjutsu!
Oh, brothers fighting for my love!
I'm sorry, Edward-san, but you're not my type.
Stop making a fool of yourself!
Hey, Alphonse!
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
My poor head!
Who is this woman, Alphonse-sama?
Huh?
You're so cruel, Alphonse-sama!
After all, you have me!
No, she's just a childhood friend!
Wait, what am I trying to justify?
May-chan, don't go so far away alone!
Oh, brothers!
Who are you?
Do you remember who I am?
Who are you?
Do you remember who I am, Marko?
Marko-san?
What's wrong with your face?
How did you get here?
Oh, brothers!
Who are you?
Just don't tell me you forgot me!
This is me, Yoki-sama, the manager of the coal mines in Utsville!
Oh, I forgot!
Who are you?
And after all that you did to me, how cruel!
1914, Utsville.
Utsville, a mining town.
I, Yoki, was a senior officer in the city and managed it.
Thanks to my efforts, people lived happily.
You delayed the tax, pay it immediately.
How can we pay if you constantly reduce our salaries?
Then a rare passerby appeared in the city, a state alchemist Edward Elric!
Silver watch, a state alchemist!
Gold!
I buy you the right to own a mine.
But it was a trap!
How do you understand that? The alchemist gave it!
All the gold I got from you turned into coal!
It turns out they agreed behind my back!
That's how a person whose property was stolen was trampled by people who forgot how much he did for them!
And the army is declared a criminal!
I worked hard to return my previous position and a good name, but nothing came out!
Even my most reliable investments...
were burned down!
I had one last chance!
I came to the richest house in the capital to make money!
What?
It's all their fault, the Elric brothers!
That day I swore...
Yes, I swore to avenge those who did this to me!
And my revenge will be scarier than death itself!
I will never lose to you, you betrayer!
But I didn't betray anyone...
I told you, there's nothing between us!
Stop talking and tell us Rin Tanjutsu!
Hey, at least you listened to my story!
Yes, yes, you had to, old man!
I understand what you feel!
Don't pretend you listened to me!
Wienerisan is gone?
What the hell were you doing here?
I'm sorry.
I'll find her.
Two of Charlie's squad will come with me.
Yes!
Major Miles!
I remember, Sharar!
We'll let you know if we find him.
Okay.
It's empty here.
There's nothing edible here.
Sharar, isn't that right?
Kimble is waiting for you.
You will come with us.
You have a sharp smell.
But don't you think that two people can handle me?
Of course, ordinary people can't do that.
But we're not ordinary people.
So, we're chimeras.
Interesting.
Sounded for free.

I've learned a lot since then.
The secret of creating the Philosopher's Stone.
And something terrible about the origin of our country and its alchemy.
We decided that Rintan Jutsu Xing can help us, so we went in search of May.
What did you expect?
In fact, there was a man who understood this before us.
His research was saved in this notebook.
I think this is the key to solving our mystery.
So, if we decipher the records, then...
Yes, most likely.
But we need Sharama's help.
What does he have to do with it?
What was that?
Sharama just went there.
Are they military?
Winry, Marko-san, wait here.
Al and I will go and check.
Sharama is here.
Sharama is here.
Damn, this Jirdai is fast.
We know everything about you.
Your attacks are useless if you can't reach us.
We will constantly attack you from a distance.
I see.
I have already studied your technique of destroying the floor under your feet to lick as soon as it gets dangerous.
You will be slightly shaken when we pass you to Kimble.
Oh, what do we have here?
Looks like we arrived on time again.
Oh, hey.
The Elric brothers?
That voice...
Brother, these are the Kimblee who came from the capital.
What?
I see.
You are late.
Sharama has already been caught.
Monsters!
What the hell are you?
We are your allies.
We don't know any monsters.
Damn, they pretend to be our friends to eat us.
This fat guy has such a huge mouth.
He can swallow me whole.
Calm down, you idiots.
So?
This bastard is even faster than Sharama.
Brother?
What's so funny?
She's so light.
As if my arm and leg turned into wings.
Northern armor is great.
How dare you laugh at me, you bastard?
Oops, the power of my blow has also decreased.
You just can't get rid of my saliva.
Slime?
What a disgusting thing.
Here you go.
If it's saliva, then...
It can be transformed into water.
Oh, cold.
Here you go.
Why did you do that, brother?
Stop it, you're peeling my skin.
My new one.
If you touch the cold metal with your wet hand, you will freeze to attack it.
What the hell are you doing, metal scene?
You have to help us.
Shut up, Sevinthus.
I see you for the first time in my life.
Which side will not look at a negative character?
How will you prove that you are our ally?
Okay, right now I'll turn back, so watch.
I was waiting for this.
Zampana!
It's stupid to put the weapon in front of the enemy's face.
Damn it, get away from me.
Okay, okay, take a little rest.
Have you already recovered?
Will you go with us?
It's time to answer for your crimes, Shuram.
I will destroy everyone who stands in my way.
It goes straight to my hand, you idiot.
Your right hand is the end of steel.
Too bad.
Only she is no longer made of steel.
And now?
Stop!
Idiot, why did you come?
Don't come closer.
Major Miles?
What the hell is this?
It seems that terrible experiments are being carried out in the headquarters.
Tie them to the columns.
Yes!
So, Shuram.
It's hard for me to judge someone like me.
But I can't let you stay alive.
Someone like you?
Brother Elric, I'll take care of the rest myself.
Winry!
Idiot, don't come near him.
Let me go.
Everything is fine.
Are you okay?
Miss, don't come near.
Let me talk to him.
I wanted to meet him face to face for a long time.
Why did you kill my father and mother?
No matter what I say, it will only be a pitiful attempt to apologize.
I really killed the family of doctors and rock-bells.
What happened?
The building in which they are now is in that direction.
It's bad.
It's been 24 hours.
Our Snow Queen has probably already sealed the passage.
We should have expected this.
We had to look for a way out in the complete darkness.
Otherwise, someone would start crying that a monster from the shadows would come after them.
Welcome back.
Saved.
Hurry up and take these two to the doctor.
Sorry.
I am Argusrog, Dr.
Are you take this to a therapist?
Eat, do not get tired.
Erin, it looks like an adventure is just beginning.
Everything is fine.
Why is she so hot?
It's all right.
I think I told you to close the tunnel in 24 hours.
There was a case, but...
24 hours are not over yet.
By the way, General Lieutenant Armstrong lent me these watches.
General!
Did you save the front squad?
Only two.
I see.
What are you doing here?
I admire the mountains.
I like this eternal winter.
Everything is either black or white.
I love when everything is clearly defined.
Really?
Look there. There is also a blue color.
Just like the hearts of people.
Thank you for not leaving us there, Mem.
I don't understand what you're talking about.
We have guests.
My respects.
I apologize for going straight to the point, but we have a few questions for you.
Don't come any closer, everyone back!
Damn it!
All-metal?
Kimbley?
Bastard, why didn't you watch Winry?
Kimbley is on the roof!
