The Immortal Army
It hurts! Help!
Food!
Food!
It hurts!
That's right!
Experiments are not completed, you say?
This is an experiment!
And he succeeded!
Perfected soldiers, who will never die, will not give up and will undoubtedly obey our orders!
Here it is, our immortal army!
Dad?
That's right!
I am your father!
You will listen to your dad!
Our headquarters was attacked by an insurgent squadron!
Dad!
You must!
It hurts!
It hurts!
It hurts!
It hurts!
It hurts!
It hurts!
It hurts!
It hurts!
It hurts!
It hurts!
Wow, Divertza!
I have a bad feeling.
Are we really here?
Yes.
That's how I described them.
Who is this?
Number 66.
Barimisnik.
He was a partner of the Trash.
Open up, you bastard!
Damn it!
How do I open them?
Back off!
Open up!
Open up!
Order the troops fighting with the soldiers of Brix and Mustang to retreat immediately!
And what? Are you going to shoot?
Your subordinates lack discipline!
The soldiers of Brix will not spare anyone if you do not call back your people.
You don't want them all to die, do you?
Barricade all the entrances to headquarters!
Don't let the soldiers of Brix and Mustang come here!
Even a sell-out dog like you has a little courage left.
You will not get away from here alive, bitch!
We will not leave you alive!
We will not leave you alive!
We will not leave you alive!
We will not leave you alive!
We will not leave you alive!
We will not leave you alive!
Even a sell-out dog like you has a little courage left.
You will not get away from here alive, bitch!
We will not leave you alive!
We will not leave you alive!
Oh, missed!
You are in the way!
I'm sick and tired of you.
Well, now one more place is free.
Take my thanks, homunculus.
You saved me from the need to stain the blood of this scoundrel with the family sword of Strang.
Here you are!
I'm sick and tired of you.
Still alive?
It hurts!
Food!
Food!
It hurts! It hurts!
Brother!
Could it be?
Did they put souls of people in these dolls?
Damn, they have no end!
What are these creatures? I have nothing to know! Why don't they die?
It's a matter of shit if they get out.
Weapons!
What happened? Who knows?
I heard Colonel Mustang started a coup.
Where is this world going?
Quiet, don't cry.
What to do?
Oh, you!
Damn, they're coming out!
I'm sorry, now we have nowhere to retreat.
Everything is fine.
I was going to turn this passage into a pile of stones myself.
Now you can focus on the battle.
Great, now we can not worry that they will get out into the city.
We will show them what we are capable of!
It hurts!
It hurts so much!
I can't believe they created this!
So, to get to this bearded son of a bitch, we have to go through them?
Don't stop me!
Mustang is trying to hide in an ice cream van.
Cover all the large lines.
An ordinary truck is leading, but there is a pile of weapons inside.
Be careful!
A bear! A bear with a syracuse!
The signal is gone.
What kind of bear?
It must be Captain Buccaneer.
Now it will be hard for us to break into the city, Colonel.
That's right.
So, an ice cream van, huh?
I wonder how they are there?
The thought that I can not help anything drives me crazy.
I did not think that the expectation could be so heavy.
He does not stop knocking all day.
Hey, Alphonse, what kind of noise is that?
Just Selim is playing with my head.
Even with the monster inside, he remains an ordinary child.
Stop him, Alphonse!
Do not allow him to make any sounds!
This is Asbucamorze, the code that is used in the army for communication.
He tells them where we are.
Hello!
Thank you for following me, Kim Lee.
For God's sake, stop throwing such nonsense at me.
Oh, come on, forgive me for this mistake.
I will not let you get into trouble anymore.
Sounded for free viewing.
Thank you.
Here is the website.
What kind of monster is this?
You deceived me, Envy!
I did not lie!
The one who chases after you is Aie!
And the one who chases after you is Mertie!
A small knock.
Oh, yes!
I'm back!
Thank you for your help, little girl.
What did the military need here?
Why do they drive us out of the houses?
God, where should we go now?
What the hell?
Did they really find out that we were hiding here?
Oh no, Alphonse!
Wait, Doc!
They can not guess that you are Dr. Mark.
But I can not just sit here for now.
Calm down.
You will only let Alphonse down if you let them grab you.
You can not throw yourself into battle, and draw your head.
It is better for us not to stick out.
Yes?
Are you alone?
I thought Golo didn't come with you.
I took his strength.
Did you eat your brother?
He was not my brother, but part of the system.
We were born from the same father.
He was not my brother, but part of the system.
He was not my brother, but part of the system.
We were born from the same father.
We were born from the same father.
We were born from the same father.
And now we are united again.
Is that so?
Hankiel!
Oh, you're not dead yet.
After all, these chimeras are living creatures.
Hankiel!
Damn it!
Let me go!
You're not going anywhere.
Oh, you're tiny!
It's useless.
Stop running away!
What?
I knew it.
That's enough, Lieutenant-General Armstrong!
Here and now!
You're not going anywhere!
You're not going anywhere!
Here and now!
You're not going anywhere!
Fire!
Fire!
Asshole!
I should have known to focus everyone in one place.
I hope it at least scratched him.
Got you!
I won't let you go anymore.
A woman-general should die.
Sister!
You're not wounded!
Who are you talking to, Alex?
I'm glad you're okay.
What kind of creature is that?
A homunculus.
They don't take bullets.
They need the power of artillery.
They need the power of artillery.
I see.
But that's my element.
Give it to your brother, Alex.
Come on, monster.
I'm sick of it.
Leave me alone.
Run away from here.
No!
Don't build a hero for yourself,
or they'll take us both.
Leave me alone,
then you'll have a chance to escape.
Not at all.
Don't keep yourself ahead of time.
Don't keep yourself ahead of time.
Fool!
Look at our situation
against us, Kimblee and Pride.
Leave me alone.
Don't give up.
I'll find a way to save you.
Damn it.
Move, stupid leg.
We can't lose,
not now.
Hang on, Heinkel.
Don't die.
You and your brother.
Why do you keep thinking about others
even when you're on the verge of death?
We swore.
We swore to each other
that we would never let anyone die again.
Exactly.
Even Kimblee kept saying
that to survive means to win.
I almost forgot about one valuable thing
that I got from him.
Where did you get this?
Kimblee dropped it in the northern mine,
and I picked it up.
A philosophical stone.
With its help, we can overcome them.
But...
Yes, I know.
People were sacrificed for its creation.
Your brother said
that you didn't want to die.
Your brother said
that you didn't want to use it
to return your body.
Then...
Then do it not for yourself,
but to protect the whole world.
I trust you because
you can see people
even inside this stone.
I know what they feel.
It doesn't matter what they look like now.
They still want to fight
to protect what is dear to them.
Let them help you.
Okay.
Get the hell out of them.
Aliphons.
Yes.
Let's fight together.
I'm sick and tired of this dust.
Maybe we should blow it up with an explosive wave?
No.
They're still there.
He won't be able to escape with his feet torn off.
Well, well.
You weren't going to run away, were you?
Great!
Excellent, Aliphons Elric!
Great, Aliphons Elric!
Great, Aliphons Elric!
The End
