White scenery is inviting me now
I'm going to a world I haven't seen yet
A solid metal alchemist
I was lost, I was traveling under the mouse-colored sky
A map of the day
Many dreams were blurred
Someday, even if I'm small
I wonder if I can go beyond those clouds
Strong and wounded, as if my heart was torn apart
The raindrops that fell on the ground
Repeatedly
A straight light crosses
Without telling me where to go
I'll go through anywhere
I'll burn the pale remains in my eyes
No matter where I am under this sky
I'm going to a world I haven't seen yet
Edward Kuhn?
You seem to have grown up
Pinaka told me
That you were trying to transform a man
And how dare you come here after so many years?
You have no place here anymore!
Oh, yeah
Why did you burn my house?
We have no way back
This is proof of our determination
Lies
You just didn't want to see him anymore
You wanted to run away from those terrible memories
Destroy all the traces of your sin
It's not true!
You're like a child who's soaked in a dream and hides it
You ran away, Edward
What do you know, bastard?
I'm sick of you!
He looks so much like me in my youth
Episode 20. The Father in front of the grave
You look exactly the same
Like in the old days
Why didn't you come back earlier?
You were a child
You were a child
You were a child
You were a child
Why didn't you come back earlier?
Trisha was waiting for you
Pinaka
Asya
What my boys created
Was it really Trisha?
What?
I told you
You didn't look like a different person
He didn't have anything in common with Trisha
No, I'm not talking about that
For example, the color of the eyes or the hair
What are you talking about?
Are you saying it wasn't Trisha?
And the boys hurt themselves
To create something that was never their mother?
What? You don't want to eat or sleep?
Yes, I'll live as long as this seal is intact
Unbelievable! You're practically immortal!
That's not true
My body is like a time bomb
I learned it from Barry
You can't attach a soul to a body that it doesn't belong to
Sooner or later, it will start to tear off
Maybe tomorrow, or maybe in ten years
I don't know myself
It can't be
Then we need to find a way to get your body back as soon as possible
Wait, can't you move your soul somewhere else?
When the old body starts to wear out
And you will live in peace
Without feeling pain and hunger
It's so comfortable
It's not comfortable at all
What do you know about it?
I'm sorry
Winry!
Winry, I'm coming in
I never know how to get out of myself
You and your brother always make scandals before
Looks like this body won't be able to sleep
You will be able to get your body back, right?
Right?
Give my brother's body back!
He's the closest person to me!
Give it back?
What are you talking about?
You made him like this
Alchemist
Is that true?
You're the same as me
Edward Elric
And more
Edward, I don't want to be like this
Ed, stop sleeping
Your father is leaving
Can I take this?
But we're all together on it
Please
Thank you
I'll tell you something as a sign of gratitude
Something terrible will happen to you soon
Leave the country
Something terrible is always happening here
Moreover, there are children who consider this place their home
Don't tell me I didn't warn you
Hohenheim!
Have a look at the dinner, okay?
I'm sorry, Pinaka
That I can't eat your strip anymore
Edward
Do you really want to dig this up?
Have you changed your mind?
No, I'm just tired of my old wounds
Looks like it's going to rain soon
Let's finish this as soon as possible
Edward
I told you
Let's stop
Edward
Edward
Edward
Edward
Edward
Edward
Edward
Let's stop
No
I won't be able to move on until I'm satisfied
And you ran away
I'm going to run away
Edward
But first, let's walk
Oh dear
You've been對了
Oh my
Oh my
Oh my
Oh my
Oh my
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
Ed.
This is not your mother.
Oh, no.
Of course.
You can't bring back the one who died.
That's the truth.
It was impossible from the very beginning.
Ed, calm down.
Take yourself in your hands.
I'm fine, Grandma.
Since that very day, it has been a symbol of despair for us.
But now it's a ray of hope.
Al can bring his body back.

Curtis, speaking.
It's Ed.
What happened?
Well, I want to ask you something, Sensei.
How would you say it?
What's the matter? Speak clearly.
Do you remember how you tried to resurrect your child?
Yes.
What is it?
The creature we created with Salam was not our mother.
What are you talking about?
What are you trying to say?
Was there a child that you transformed back then?
Was he really yours?
I see.
So my son and his wife
helped many people in that war.
I'm proud of them.
This...
Huenheim, where did he go?
I have no idea.
He didn't say a word.
Oh, I almost forgot.
I have an important message for him.
A message?
Yes.
The last words, Trisha.
Please tell him
when he comes back.
I'm sorry I couldn't keep my promise.
I'm leaving first.
Promise? What promise?
I have no idea.
It's not convenient to ask you, but
could you tell him? It's for me.
Why me?
Maybe you won't tell him, but
he's really worried about you two.
Maybe. I'll tell him.
But first, tell him as soon as possible.
Are you going back to the capital?
Yes.
I'm going to get it.
Since I left, I've done so much
without telling him.
What the hell is this?
I'm sorry.
You...
You don't even have a place to live.
And you...
What the hell are you doing here?
We're eating.
God, what happened to you?
Homunculi and bariumicinic?
In addition to everything,
the incompatibility of the soul and body?
For missing parts,
you will have to use the metal from the armor.
Al, can you become the same?
Of course.
If I say I'll return his body,
then I'll return it.
Al.
I dug out the remains of the creature
that we created when I was in Risenburg.
No.
No.
No.
No.
But...
Why did you do that?
I was sure it wasn't our mother.
What?
Wait.
We...
We created something completely different.
It can't be.
After all, I...
And now I know for sure
that we can return your previous body.
Really?
Yes.
But first we need to clarify one thing.
Do you remember
how we fought with Al
because... well...
one of us got married in Wiener?
We talked about it on the roof with you recently.
Yes.
Then you rejected it, Al.
I had a body.
And now I have a question for both of you.
Why did you refuse him?
I don't want to marry a guy who doesn't marry me.
How can you judge people by their height?
And what does it have to do with Al's return?
In short, if Al has a memory
of something I don't know
and you remember the same thing,
it means it really was.
And if you remember everything
that happened to you until you were 10,
the soul that I attached to the armor
and in fact the soul of Al,
I managed to return only your soul,
but I was able to take it from the gate.
And if I took the soul,
I can also return your body from there.
The body continues to exist
separately from the soul,
just like...
Barry the butcher!
Al, try to remember
the moment when you were drawn
to the gate of truth.
There...
There was me!
It was me!
Exactly!
So it remains only
to take your body from there,
just like the soul, brother!
Now I remember!
I saw you with the eyes of the creature
with my mother!
So your soul was inside?
Maybe she left it
because of the rejection reaction.
It seems we didn't hurt
someone else's soul.
Elric-sama, is Mikurty-sama on the line?
I studied
my family,
my husband,
my child.
With such a color of hair and skin,
it couldn't be ours.
Did you manage to find something?
Yes!
The confidence that I can return the body of Al!
You can't return the dead!
Of course!
I didn't miss anything!
It was impossible
from the very beginning.
Ed!
Yes!
Thank you!
What did Sensei say?
I don't quite understand,
but it seems she thanked me.
Al!
To be honest,
since that very day
I blamed myself
that it was me!
I was the one who
betrayed my mother and killed her!
Me too, Al!
Thank you, brother!
Now I know
that I didn't kill her!
Izumi!
The stone fell from my heart!
I didn't kill our child
twice!
But it was my fault
that you became like this!
I will return your old body,
no matter what it is!
Brother!
It's not your fault!
Don't say it like it's your fault!
You're always trying
to blame yourself!
I'm tired of the fact
that other people are suffering because of me!
Ah, Yusan!
When I found out about his death,
I firmly decided that my body
shouldn't be sacrificed
for the sake of his return!
You know,
I met a lot of people
who lost their human form,
but they still
continued to live a full life!
Even though I'm like this,
they still treat me
like a human being!
I may die
at any moment,
but ordinary people
from flesh and blood are also immortal!
Nothing prevents me
from living a normal life
in this body!
Now I understand it,
but
I still can't accept it!
I...
I...
I'm tired of the nights of complete loneliness!
Only because of this
I want to return my old body!
Then it's done!
I'm going to get rid of
all the shit
from this guy who calls himself
the truth and get your body out of there!
Yes!
Huh?
Did he always
have such broad shoulders?
