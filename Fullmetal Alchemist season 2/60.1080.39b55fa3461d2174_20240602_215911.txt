What's up?
They sent a negotiator to us
Our man will go alone
Don't shoot
Hands behind your head
One wrong move and you're dead
Everything is fine
Let him go
He can be trusted
Lieutenant!
I'm sorry
Can I meet my husband?
No way
If you get out of here
The military involved in the coup can catch you
Please be patient
Please be patient
Yes, you're right
They're right
Episode 60
Heaven and Earth
Oh, so you refuse to admit the truth
Exactly
Besides, do you really think that you've gathered us here and already won?
Damn it, we'll let you use us
Talk as much as you want
Can you get up?
We need to run
You have nowhere to run
Now you're all in my belly
What the hell is this?
The type they call the father inside this, right?
Colonel Mustang is now with his father
However, he is not sure that he arrived there safe and sound
May!
Stop, bitch!
Hey, you!
You're immortal, aren't you?
Silence is a sign of agreement
Alfonsama
He's mine
Stop!
You can't fight him alone
No, I have the power of the Rentanjutsu
Of course, you can use the Rentanjutsu even if it blocks the alchemy, but...
And you two, deal with that little homunculus
It's so easy to think
He said that he made the colonel open the gate
If they had such a trick in stock, why did they wait until the end?
When I was already in the transformation circle, he said
I didn't think it would come to this, but I have no choice
So it was a too risky step?
Looks like it
Well, let's check it out
Great, the alchemy works!
He dodged it, but didn't make it
Great, the alchemy works!
He dodged it, but didn't make it
He always counterattacked with his shadows
Then let's go!
Yes!
They decided to destroy everything again
What a tough boys
I'll take your immortality
You are too much!
Disappear!
Wait, girl, he can transform without moving a finger!
May!
Report the situation!
We still can't contact the central headquarters
Reporting!
There is a message about the activity of the Shvarites all over the city
They are attacking our...
Bastards!
I'm sorry, there is no time to explain everything
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
No, don't!
Help, save!
I'm sorry, ma'am, we won't do anything bad to you
We need help
We are in this house now, right?
It's getting darker and darker
I hope everything is fine with the others
Is it really here?
Yes, no doubt
Well
Now
It's your turn, Shram
How wonderful it is to feel the breath of death
Now my will is subdued only by one desire
To fight to the death
Call
Career
Race, gender and even race
Call
Career
Race, gender and even race
All this is in the past
I have no more chains
There is only you and me and my desire to fight
It's so drunk
I've been waiting for this for so long
I've been waiting for this for so long
Is that all?
Is that all you can do?
I don't have enough of this
Prove that you want to defeat me, nameless man
Prove that you want to defeat me, nameless man
Pam!
What?
You don't believe your eyes?
You didn't expect this from me, did you?
Until recently, I could not imagine that one day I would use it.
Years of eternity, I thought about what to do.
And now I have found the answer.
This is the power of recreation, my elder brother left it to me.
You people will always get to the end.

May!
Damn! Al, help May!
And Pride? I'll handle this bitch myself!
Got it!
Girl!
Don't make noise, Hohenheim!
Alphonse Sama!
What's wrong with you, baby?
You won't even scratch me with such attacks!
Don't show off!
You're still alive only because you need you!
Well, then I'll take advantage of my position to finish you off!
Finish me off? Well, try it!
Rats are more used to fighting with people who are higher than him.
In other words, you are a complete pro fan in a fight with those who are lower than you!
Papa Pro Fan!
Papa, I'm sorry if I hurt you!
Oh, come on!
And in fact, all my opponents were bigger than me!
Well, that's why!
I know better than anyone how to deal with rats!
I know better than anyone how to deal with rats like you!
Sensei!
His alchemy is something!
The time has almost come!
The time has come!
We've played enough!
It's your time, my precious victims!
Oh, well, so be it!
Hurry up!
We have to get to the center of the Transforming Circle!
Hurry up! We can't stay here!
Calm down!
Take me to the center of the circle!
Hurry up, or he'll swallow us!
Hurry up!
We have to get to the center of the circle!
Hurry up, or he'll swallow us!
Hurry up, or he'll swallow us!
The time has come!
The time has come!
Have you ever thought that the Earth is a living organism?
No, more precisely, not an organism, but a whole system!
A system that possesses all the knowledge of the universe,
in comparison with the knowledge of people, nothing!
Can you imagine what power can be obtained by opening the door to the Earth?
Here and now, thanks to you, these doors will be opened!
So this is the center of the circle!
Grid?
Give me the center of the world, old man!
The whole world belongs to me!
Did it work?
Did it work?
I knew you would come, my son!
You were born for a reason out of my greed!
Your desire is only a reflection of mine!
No!
The center of the world is here!
Damn it!
What the hell?
What's going on?
What is it?
What's going on?
This is...
What is it?
What?
That's it! Fight each other, Guardian of the Gate!
Amazing power! I barely managed to control it!
With such power, I can open the Gate of the Planet!
What is it?
What is it?

What are you doing?
Tell us everything...
Everything!
Oh, Lord...
Winry!
What's...

Edda! Edda!
Edda!
Oh, come in!
Wow, wow, wow, wow!
Yes, come out!
Now even you can not stop me!
I will not throw you from heaven to earth and you will become a part of me!
