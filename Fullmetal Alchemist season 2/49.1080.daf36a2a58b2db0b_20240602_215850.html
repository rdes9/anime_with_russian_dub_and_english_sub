What? Dad?
It's me.
If you're here, then this is Kanama?
She's the one.
But how did I end up here?
That's right, Pride.
Dad, I was in charge of the Gamon Cool Pride.
I know. Hario-san told me about it.
I know. Hario-san told me about it.
I'm Darius.
Oh my God.
It's like he's been digging into my soul.
It's a disgusting feeling.
My blood gave life to the one who created this monster.
Maybe he was able to control you through the seal.
Because in the one who drew it, my blood flows too.
Old man!
He needs help urgently.
What's going on there?
So you're Edward's father?
Yes.
This Shadow Lord swallowed the gluttony and became even stronger.
Greed and Edward are fighting him, but they barely have a chance.
It's all my fault.
I allowed Pride to capture you, and now everyone is in his trap.
Because of the fire, he has a lot of light sources.
I don't have any light grenades left.
Our old strategy won't work anymore.
This is bad.
If this continues, the residents of the city may suffer.
Dad.
Dad, you're an excellent alchemist, aren't you?
Yeah, there's a little bit.
I have a plan, but we need your help.
Well, now you're on my side.
It's no use hiding in the shadows.
I can smell your smell.
Damn it.
Hey, you're alive there, huh?
I guess so.
Now is not the best time to worry about other Greed.
How much life do you have left?
Monster.
Can you talk so rudely about your brother, Greed?
It's okay if I eat you.
You're risking to earn an unboiled stomach, older brother.
Oh, yeah, you still decided to honor us with your attention, Hohenheim.
The hero always appears at the very last moment.
Hero?
Do you really expect me to win?
No, it's impossible.
You're too scary.
What did he come up with?
What is he going to do?
Is he going to attack now?
What a useless plan.
And you can't stop in time.
I didn't expect the hostage to come back to me himself.
Son, are you really a fool?
Don't you dare...
...smile at my son.
Hohenheim!
Holy shit!
Did he get him?
What the hell?
Why did Al also end up in this trap?
What were you thinking about?
I had nothing to do with it.
It was his idea.
My plan worked.
Now you can't use your strength.
Aren't you too early to be happy, huh?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Aren't you too early to be happy, huh?
You can't get away from here.
As soon as you make a way to escape...
...I'll let out my shadow and...
...only then am I not going to run away.
Let's see who of us will be more patient.
No, more precisely, Haman Kulpride.
My body doesn't need oxygen, light and food.
We and you will stay here until that day is over.
We practically had no chance to overcome Pride, especially because innocent people could suffer.
That's why Al decided that it is more important to harm him now than to destroy him.
In addition, now we have time to come up with a way to fight him.
But why didn't he consult me?
Al said, if we tell the brother, he will not agree to anything.
He went to this so that we could all survive.
Don't be angry at him.
Okay, we need to put out the fire.
Al! Brother!
Al! I'm sorry I didn't consult you.
But I had to. After all, you got into his trap because of me.
Besides, I need to spend only one day here.
Everything will be fine, brother.
Last is dead, Envy is no more, and now Glock is not.
Ra's is watching the teachings in the east, and Pride is in the trap.
In the capital, there are only sloths and old men.
Grit, what are you thinking, asshole?
Didn't I tell you? I'm going to rule the world.
Sounded for free.
site anida.com
Yes, this is anida.com.
There are too many sloths in the capital lately.
Yes, yes, I heard a whole gang gathered in an abandoned building in the west.
By the way, about the sloths, do you remember the guy with the scar who lived here?
I wonder how he is there?
Hello, how are you?
We just remembered you.
We are looking for Kanama's place.
It's in the forest, south of the city.
I see, thank you.
Isn't this girl with you?
Well, the one who always carries a black and white cat.
She was just here.
What?
She didn't come home?
What is she thinking about?
Well, you did it after all.
What do you mean?
It's your business.
You blew up the Bradley train in the east.
Blown up?
What?
So I was wrong?
We hear about it for the first time.
I thought you were with the other sloths at the same time.
There are rumors that they are preparing a terrorist attack in the capital.
I know that many sloths came to the capital, but they are not here for this.
They want to change this country by force.
They are my brothers, my comrades.
Well, that's how I got into work.
What happened to your new suit?
After all, the most interesting thing will start after dawn.
It's useless.
I don't think Dad created this trap so that the child could destroy it.
You will know how to keep people from fools.
You don't know us well.
Don't hope that everyone will dance to your tune.
And the same with your plan.
To me, he is too naive.
Naive?
Yes.
You call us valuable victims and, apparently,
you can't do anything without us.
What if we decided to run away and hide in another country?
Then your whole plan would be covered with a copper basin.
And in fact, there are people who only care about their own skin.
But, for example, the wife of the race.
Once I was almost hit by a car.
Then she risked her life to save me.
Despite the fact that I am a homunculus,
her desperate desire to protect me amazed me.
I have a father, but I never have a mother.
I was actually amazed by her.
I think then I realized what it was like to have a mother.
The wife of the race.
You mean Madame Bradley?
Yes.
How could you deceive such a kind woman?
Let our family life be just a game.
I got real pleasure from her.
And I loved her.
Then there are people like the wife of the race who are ready to give their own life for those who are dear to them.
Those of you who have the most decisive hearts and strong will,
were chosen as valuable victims.
Damn it, you would have run away from the country.
Not thinking about what awaits you, you turned away to fight.
Our plan was not naive, and it worked.
Colonel, it's time for us to go.
Yes.
Let's go, Senior Lieutenant.
What the hell?
What happened here?
Just look at this mountain.
Ohana, Jelsa, Zanpana, Darius.
Did Kimble really send you here?
Yes.
Jelsa, Zanpana, Darius.
Did Kimble really send you here to kill us?
What? Are you crazy?
I don't serve Kimble anymore.
You're just saying that, and you're going to finish us off yourself.
No, I don't believe you.
Henkel must have hidden somewhere and is about to attack us.
Marco-san, please listen to me.
Edward Kuhn.
Ed Sheeran is also with you.
I understand that you are tired from the road, but we need to go.
Quiet, you bastards, pig, fat, gorilla, shut up finally.
But we'll shut you up now.
So you really don't work for Kimble anymore?
He used us, and then threw us out like garbage.
Edward, it's better to be dead than six Kimble.
That's for sure.
In any case, they won't let us die.
When the sun rises, it will finally come.
Yes, I hope we will all meet at the next dawn.
Looks like they're done.
Where did the old man go?
To investigate what is happening in the capital.
Alone?
Yes.
Of all of us, his enemies do not know in person, so he will be able to move unnoticed.
He said he would try to find out about Colonel Mustang's actions.
But I think Link is much more concerned about where he went.
I see.
Have you discussed everything with Sheeran and the others?
Well, in principle, everything is ready.
I see. So the time has come.
Your brother is a real man.
I would go crazy if I found myself locked up in the dark with these monsters.
Yeah.
Al did everything he could.
Now it's up to us.
The day has come.
The day has come.
The day has come.
The day has come.
The day has come.
The day has come.
The day has come.
The day has come.
The day has come.
The day has come.
The day has come.
The day has come.
The day has come.
The day has come.
The day has come.
The day has come.
The day has come.
The day has come.
The day has come.
The day has come.
I feel the warmth of your right hand.
It's here.
I'll miss what?
The eclipse!
The eclipse?
God, do you even know what time it is now?
The eclipse will begin soon.
Hey, don't you dare look at the sun through the pipe!
You'll blind!
I know, I know.
Brother, come here!
Something is burning in the city!
Don't go out of the house today!
The C-D unit from the eastern district has detected a group of Mustangs in the square C-75.
They entered the battle, but the hostages hold Genu Fuhrer hostage.
Therefore, it is difficult for them to act.
Damn it, let them attack.
What?
We only need Roy Mustang alive.
The hostages have already played their part.
Get rid of her along with the colonel's subordinates.
Take your place!
Will you shoot?
Kill them all except Colonel Mustang!
Those who are used to living in the world of the hostages do not notice the war, even when it has begun.
They cannot imagine what awaits them ahead.
Next, in the goal on the metal alchemist, episode 50, the battle for the capital.
The weak will die at the feet of the strong.
This is war.
