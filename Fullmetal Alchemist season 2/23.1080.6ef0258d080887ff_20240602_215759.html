        <pre>White scenery is inviting me now
I'm going to a world I've never seen before
Metal Alchemist
I was lost
I was traveling under the mouse-colored sky
The map of the day
Many dreams were blurred
Someday
Even if I'm a small child
I wonder if I can go beyond those clouds
Strongly injured
Like a broken heart
The crumbling raindrops
Repeatedly
A straight light intersects
With no end in sight
I'll go through anywhere
I'll burn it in my eyes
No matter where I am under this sky
I'm going to a world I've never seen before
Episode 23 Girl on the battlefield
A light bomb and a smoke grenade
You're a clever young man
Can you smell them?
Officer
Please take her to a safe place
Winry
Al is still fighting, so...
I have to go
I'm sorry
I'll tell you everything when I get back
Why?
Why can I only wait?
He says we took the eighth section under the protection of a girl on St. Louis Street
She's probably a close friend of an all-metal alchemist
Take her to the headquarters
I think it's time to get started
Cover them
Yes, sir
I have an empty house in the suburb
We'll meet there
Make sure you don't have a tail
Yes, sir
I'll contact you if something happens
Okay
Don't even think about getting out of here
I know, I know
He's so persistent
The further you go, the fewer people there are
We're trapped
A scar again?
Take care of him
I'll take care of these two
My left hand
What's wrong with it?
Young master
I'm all useful now
What are you talking about?
You risk dying yourself by saving me
I know that if there is no people, the kings will disappear
But if there is no king, there will be no one to rely on
For the sake of our clan, you must survive
I won't leave you
For the sake of achieving goals, many have to sacrifice
Renfan, what are you thinking?
Stop!
Stop!
Tell me, you coward, there's nothing inside your armor
You're pathetic
And even in this position, you still believe in alchemy
Yes, it's not easy to live with such a body
But it doesn't make me feel sorry at all
You have nothing to feel sorry for
I'm still alive thanks to alchemy, my brother
To give up on myself means to give up on my brother and alchemy
But I believe in the power of alchemy
I want to believe in it
I see
I see
Brother, what about Winry?
She's safe
I'm such a fool, I made her cry again
You're always so careless
And it seemed to her that her eyes were covered in blood
Yeah
Okay, let's start the second round
Got you!
It's boiling!
You?
It's a tattoo!
Homunculus!
Link!
Get down!
No!
I need a strong rope
Wait a minute!
This time, the ability to regenerate will ruin you
The more you grow inside, the stronger the rope is
I can't do it!
Really?
Got you, Homunculus!
Impressive
I overpowered you, monster!
What? Homunculus?
We need to leave, put him down
Wait!
Wait, Al!
The soldiers are already here
Pretend we don't know them
They're leaving!
Grab the scar!
Got it!
Maybe the colonel isn't the best guy in the area, but we can rely on him
It's much more important now
We need to grab the scar, Al!
Got it!
You'll pay for the murder of Rockbellow
And a lot of other people!
Are you okay, sir?
How dare you attack my saviour, Yoki-San?
What did you say? Look at yourself!
Who's that kid?
Girl, get away from him! He's a dangerous man!
There are too many of them!
We'll have to retreat!
What the hell is this Alchemy?
Did she transform at a distance?
Come here
Damn it! I can't see a thing!
Scaram!
I've heard a lot about you, Lin-Kiao
We're going to the shelter
Wait, my friend, we need to take her
What?
There's no time for that
I beg you, she's badly wounded
She's waiting for me
Okay, just be quick
If I'm not mistaken, she's a Mustang woman
Not bad for a young man
And it's available for free at anidap.com
I think I had the same look
No matter how hard I try, I can't see a thing
I think I had the same look
No matter how hard I try, I can't see a thing
This should stop the bleeding
Thank you
Boss, there's military police everywhere!
We need to run!
The target is wounded!
He couldn't have gone far!
Search everywhere!
That's it!
Yes!
Boss, hurry up!
Xiao Mei, Mo Hu
Where is...
Look what I've found
Idiot, when are we going to take care of her?
But she was alone there!
How much longer?
Once you took a homeless cat and kept it in your armor
without saying a word to me
Now get rid of this thing
Brother, you're so cruel!
Look how fluffy she is!
It's okay, calm down
Here you are
Thank you
Sit here, okay?
Wenri!
Yo, all-metal alchemist-kun
Fuhrer?
Why are you here?
I've been told that your childhood friend is here
She's an important person for one of my best alchemists
We have to take care of her
Well, young lady, may I leave you?
Of course, thank you for everything
She's a kind and sincere girl
Take care of her as you should
Ed
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
Ed
You promised
Tell me everything you know about mom and dad
Tell me everything
So
So they helped people to the very end
The very end
But anyway
The most I want in the world is for them to come back home alive
All I can do is wait
Oh, you're just in time
Rockball-sama is calling you
No
Hello
Garfield-san?
I'm sorry, Wenri-chan
I thought I could handle it alone
Wenri still hasn't come back
Look here, only Wenri can fix it
His clients made such a noise
Please come back, Wenri-chan
Wenri-chan, please come back
Give me a second
My leg hurts much less when you look at it
Not Garfield-san
Wenri-chan, I need you to put an outer plate on my leg as soon as possible
Give me your hand
No, I'm the first
I missed you so much
Idiot, we all miss her
Exactly
I'm sorry
I'll be back soon
Wait for me
I'll do everything I can
Thank you
Thank you for stopping me then
There are people waiting for me
Just a little more, I would never be able to look them in the eye
Wenri
Don't forget to take care of your auto armor
Of course
I'll send you the best polishing oil
Okay
Please don't die
Yes
Next time
What? I didn't hear it
Brother, wait
Bye, Wenri
Yeah
God
Wait, Ed!
What did you say?
When I force you to cry, next time it will be tears of happiness
We will definitely return our old bodies and you will cry with joy
Remember my words
Wenri
Give me your hand and your leg
One year
Now we have no way back
Why are you crying?
Wenri
Really?
I really
Love him?
Colonel, get in
We have a seriously wounded man
We need a doctor
Again for dangerous games?
Stupid boy
Of course, you have a family
If you refuse, I will not insist
I'll tell you to get the tools, wait here
You will not have a problem
I broke up with my wife right after returning from Ishivara
Did you run along the sewers with your hand cut off?
I will not be surprised if you picked up a stick
Lately, I've been dealing only with corpses
So it can be painful
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry, it's nothing
We offered you help
We work together because we have common interests
Leaving our country in search of immortality, I understood what sacrifices I would have to go for
But
I was not ready
Even Renfan was better prepared than I was
How are you?
Can we help you with something?
The trick you showed me was very useful
But I can not repeat it a second time
I need a new hand
Of course
I will introduce you to the best mechanics of car armor
Colonel of the Armed Forces Saeroy Mustang
Lingyao, the 12th son of Emperor Xing
Thank you for finding the doctor
I was indebted to you for the help in the case of Maria Rose
And I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
Marie Rose
And for catching this thing
Hey, what the hell is that?
Gaem ihm ensign
It was said that it was connected with someone from the top command of the army
With you?
It was a bit more serious
King Bradle
There is a possibility that he is also a homunculus.
He has a bandage on his eye, and under the bandage there is a Uroboros tattoo.
And he was chasing us along with Golotha.
It can not be! The ruler of the country is a homunculus?
Although ...
Inside Bradley, I do not feel a lot of souls like Golotha.
He is no different from an ordinary person.
But ...
If the Fuhrer is a homunculus, where did he get a son?
It is written in the books that homunculus can not multiply.
No!
His son Selim is adopted.
The Fuhrer does not have his own children.
Is he a monster or a human?
In any case, now it is much easier to overthrow him.
First we will extract information from him.
And then we will take the Philosopher's Stone.
Perhaps with his help it will be possible to cure my friend.
Hey, hey, hey, stop!
Ranfan sacrificed his hand to get it!
We will take him to Ksing!
Hey, wait a minute!
We have been looking for a way to return the former body for many years!
I will not allow you to fight with a homunculus!
That's it!
Link, you're an illegal immigrant!
I'm happy!
Mustang, I'm going home!
I'm going home!
Mustang!
Who killed him?
Colonel Mustang!
Ray Mustang!
What is it?
What is it?
What is it?
What is it?
What is it?
What is it?
What is it?
What is it?
What is it?
What is it?
What is it?
What is it?
What is it?
What is it?
What is it?
What is it?
What is it?
What is it?
What is it?
What is it?
What is it?
What is it?
What is it?
What is it?
What is it?
What is it?
What is it?
What is it?
Thanks for watching!
