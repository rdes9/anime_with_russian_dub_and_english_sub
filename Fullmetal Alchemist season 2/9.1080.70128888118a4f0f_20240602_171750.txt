It's still a long way to erase these feelings, isn't it?
I want to try to do what I left behind.
An all-metal alchemist
I should have been chasing the continuation of my dream,
but I can't go back to that time.
I'm looking for the sky that I lost.
I don't want to see a sad face like a sacrifice.
The end of sin is not tears.
Who are you waiting for in the color of your eyes?
I want to spit it out more honestly.
What do you want to escape from?
I want to scream that I'm alive to make reality come true.
Can you hear me?
I can't do anything without you.
There's no place to go back to.
I'm always in love with kindness, so I want to be strong.
It makes me nostalgic.
It has nothing to do with this pain.
In the search for the Philosopher's Stone,
Ed and Al entered the abandoned fifth research laboratory,
where they had to fight people whose souls were attached to their armor.
The words said by the number 66 during the battle
instilled in Al fear that his soul and memories were created by Ed artificially.
Episode 9. Improved Feelings
Finally, you came to your senses.
What about the fifth lab?
Well, it...
It was blown up, now it's completely destroyed.
Damn it, it's back to the beginning!
It hurts!
Damn it!
I almost found out the truth!
I don't have time to lie down on a sick bed!
Elementary alchemist Dono!
Please forgive us for what we are doing now!
Why didn't you listen to the major?
You almost died there!
Why do you refuse to take help from your comrades
and try to figure it out all by yourself?
Is it really so difficult to trust adults?
That's all!
Please forgive us for the rude words and actions of the broken subordination!
No!
It's all my fault!
What about the punishment?
I didn't even think about it!
And why are you talking to me so politely all the time?
Because the status of a state alchemist is equal to the title of a major!
I got a state license not for this at all!
You don't have to talk to me so officially!
Seriously?
So all this time we served you in vain?
You adapted quickly!
By the way, where is Al?
I recently met Alphonse and hit him in the head!
I completely forgot about the person who will also hit me in the head!
Alphonse!
Yes!
I'm listening!
Ed?
You don't often call us!
Well, you know...
It's not convenient for me to ask you about it,
but I need to get my self-defense back!
Could you come to the capital?
Come?
Well, yes!
My right hand!
My finger moves, but I can't even raise my hand!
It didn't work out well!
No, no, nothing!
What did you do when your hand stopped moving?
Well, I fought!
And again?
How many times do you have to repeat that you need to be careful with self-defense?
Hello?
Winry-san?
It looks like I have no choice!
How can I find you in the capital?
Why are you so kind today?
Well, I mean, no, nothing!
Okay, got it!
Sorry to bother you!
Yeah, thanks!
Did you call your girlfriend?
What girlfriend?
Well, that's not interesting!
I'm your age!
Hey!
What are you doing here?
Hey!
Al!
Brother!
Let's go to my room!
Asya?
No, it's okay!
I'll be right back!
Okay!
Let's go!
Bye-bye!
Maybe you're just a doll made by your brother?
The End
My poor bunny!
I can't imagine Al riding on these things all the time!
He said he would be waiting for me at the western exit, which I'll notice right away!
Major Armstrong!
Oh, Winry has it!
Erlich's brothers?
To tell you the truth!
This is the hospital!
You got there so quickly!
I'm sure you're going to need a lot of money for work!
So...
You were so hurt because your car broke down, because I...
I didn't prepare it properly!
No, no!
It's not your fault!
I was too careless!
And your job, as always, is flawless!
Didn't you notice that I forgot to tighten the bolt?
Besides, if I had a whole arm, I'd get even more!
So don't worry, okay?
Okay!
So you don't have any questions for me?
Okay, let's talk about my job!
I'm counting on getting a good salary for it!
You didn't drink milk!
I hate milk!
Because of your whim, you always become a rat!
Get off me!
I'm not going to drink this shit for nothing!
Be a man, Edward Elric!
All the kids should drink it!
You'll never have girls if you don't drink milk!
Al?
Lately, Al's been acting weird.
Weird?
It looks like something's bothering him.
Maybe you're just a doll, created by your little brother?
You'll be fine with that, and you'll feel better!
So, the repair's done!
Awesome! It finally works, Ed!
Thank you!
You're always welcome!
Yo, Ed!
I heard you brought a girl to your room!
No, she's my car mechanic!
Wow, so you seduced your mechanic! Not bad!
Miles Hughes! Nice to meet you!
Henry Rockwell?
Won't you have any problems because you ran away from work?
Don't worry about that.
I left Cheska to work overtime.
You're monsters!
Oh yeah, it looks like you're going to be taken care of soon.
Really?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
You're about to get out of our control.
Really?
Watch out!
Hey, come on!
Did you get involved in some unfinished business?
Well, that's kind of...
No biggie...
Well, of course, you never tell me about anything, okay, see you tomorrow, I still need to go to the hotel
What? You can stay with me
But
Well
No, don't worry, my wife and daughter will be delighted
Well
Great decision
What? Wait
Well, let's go
Wait
Happy Birthday, Lise-chan
Listen, there is a sun
What's here?
Well done for asking
Today is Lise-chan's birthday
Birthday
And how old are you, Lise-chan?
Two
Three
She is so cute

We grew up together, so for me they are like family
You must be worried about them all the time
Of course
When they returned home after so many years, it was destroyed
And now when they called me, I was seriously injured, and something happened to Alla
But they don't tell me anything
Even when they left Risenburg
Maybe they don't need to talk about it
They think you will understand even without words
But there are situations in life where you can't do without words
What can you do?
Boys prefer words over actions
And even if they have to suffer, they will not drag other people into it
They don't want to be worried about them, so they don't tell anything
But in a difficult moment when the brothers have no strength left
Can you support them?
Isn't that enough?
Elisha-chan, let's play
I'll go
Of course
No, Elisha-chan will play with me
What? I will play with her?
Your daughter uses popularity
Hey you, kids!
Hands away from my daughters or I'll kill you all!
Now you should limit yourself to words
Are you sure?
Are you sure?
You can stay with us as long as you want
No, I can't make things difficult for you
She was so attached to you
You look like real sisters
Sister!
Good luck!
Come back soon!
She has already decided where you are going to stay today
I'm so happy that I have a younger sister
Here we meet, my old enemy
You have a real body, brother
So you have to drink it
I hate it, you can't do anything with it
I grow well without it
They got you, brat, brat
Lucky you
You are already so huge
I became like this not because I wanted to
I'm sorry
You are right
It's because of my mistake that we became like this
That's why I want to return your body
How do I know that I really want to return my old body?
I'll do it
Believe me
Believe me
How can I believe you when my body is an empty piece of iron?
If you think about it, the memories are just information
That means they can be created artificially
What are you talking about?
Brother, once you wanted to tell me something that you were always afraid to talk about
Maybe you were trying to say that I was just a fake
Artificially created by you, soul and memory?
Winry, you and granny also deceived me, didn't you?
Well, is that true, brother?
So that's what you've been thinking about all this time
Is that all you wanted to tell me?
Is that all?
I see
Ed
Ed
Al
You're an idiot
What for?
Winry
Al, you're an idiot
Do you even know what Ed feels?
What Ed was afraid to ask you is
Do you blame him for what happened?
It's all my fault
He can't eat, sleep and even feel the pain
He's probably blaming me for everything
Al would never blame you
Why don't you just ask him?
I'm afraid I can't
Why don't you just ask him?
I'm afraid
I'm afraid to ask him
Ed
Now you
Who the hell would be willing to give up their own life to make a fake brother?
He's your only brother
Go after him
Okay
Are you alive?
Yes
Brother, I've been thinking
Brother, I've been thinking
I've lost my form because we haven't fought for a long time
What?
Hey, wait
Wait, brother
Don't
Your wound will open again
Ed
I won
I beat you for the first time in my life
It's not fair, brother
Shut up
Victory is victory
In childhood we fought a lot with you
Yeah
If you think we fought because of such nonsense, right?
Like who to sleep upstairs
Yeah
And we also fought for sweets
And for toys
I won then
And also when we played on the river
You pushed me into the water then
And we constantly fought during training, do you remember?
Until Sansa beat us to the death
So then there was a draw
And we also fought for who marries Winry
I don't remember this
I won
But she refused me
That's how
I don't remember
And you want to tell me that all these memories are fake?
I'm sorry
We want to return our former bodies at any cost
Are these feelings in your way also fake?
No, they are real
Exactly
We decided that we would return our bodies together
And we will go forward
If we go forward, our bodies and souls will become stronger
And milk?
I'll drink
As much as I can
Well, let's get stronger
Yeah
Yuzu-san
There are things that can only be said
What do you think?
Exactly
To be continued
Brother
Teacher
Where are you all?
Hello
You're not a cook, are you?
Oh, sorry
I forgot to introduce myself
I am a state alchemist who is ordered to destroy this area
Oh, he's awake
Where am I?
In the bushes on the edge of the eastern city
Mister, you...
I'm a cook like you
Don't worry, I'm not going to give you away
There are other surviving shwarits here
Oh, be sure
Even such a place seems to be home when you live here
As the saying goes, the whole world is a reserve of our god and shwars
I see
Don't stress
You swam in the sewers all wounded
Hey
Is my right hand still in place?
Yeah, it's badly damaged, but it's still in place
Amazing tattoos
Yeah
This is a precious inheritance that I got from my family
