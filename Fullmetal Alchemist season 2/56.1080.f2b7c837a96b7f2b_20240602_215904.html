Don't be afraid.
I just want to talk.
Please listen to me.
I will also listen to you.
Yes, that's right.
You are not alone.
Gold?
So he's from the West?
You should at least bury him as you like.
He's still alive!
It can't be!
Hold on!
How are you?
Are you all right?
Hold on!
Hold on!
Hold on!
Hold on!
Hold on!
Hold on!
Hold on!
Hold on!
Hold on!
Hold on!
Hold on!
Hold on!
Hold on!
How are you?
Bring me some water!
Don't make big sips.
Drink a little.
Do you understand our language?
Are we merchants from Xing?
Where were you going?
I have nowhere to go.
And nowhere to go back to.
I was scared to stay in Xerxes and I ran away.
I know.
Forgive me.
I couldn't stop him.
Forgive me.
Forgive me, sergeants.
Episode 56.
The return of the Fuhrer.
The return of the Fuhrer.
The sergeant was a descendant of the Fuhrer.
He worked in the palace for many years.
Do you remember that?
His son Dozul adored his father and dreamed of following his footsteps.
And the young florist Kaya is such a kind and caring girl.
Sally was breeding horses.
She only knew how to drink.
We don't have much in common.
The young florist wanted to become a scientist.
Gildes, our chef.
He was kicked out for feeding the poor and the homeless for free.
Sandra, I was friends with him when he was still a slave.
He didn't like the way I got the owner's position.
Zulu, the man who instigated the murder of the sentenced executioner.
Even he wants to punish you for your crimes.
Punish, you say?
These are the souls you took from me.
They all help me.
After all, we have one goal with them.
To destroy you.
The souls from which the stone was created help you?
It's just an energy mess.
Didn't you think it was possible?
Of course, you could go crazy, separating the soul from the soul.
In this boiling rage of the masses.
But I had enough time to talk to them.
Thanks to the immortal body that gave me this.
Talk to them?
Yes, you never tried to do this.
I talked and befriended each of the 536,329 souls imprisoned in me.
I'm sorry.
Damn you!
Come back to where you came from.
My little friend from the probirky.
I will destroy your container.
Destroy this body doesn't matter what to break your probirky.
If you lose it, you will die.
Feel the pain of people you didn't put anything on.
And who doesn't put anything on anyone here?
Hohenheim.
What?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Hohenheim.
Can you exist without a container?
You're not the only one who was preparing for our meeting.
I told you I would become a perfect creature.
What the hell?
What the hell?
He decided to attack the front?
Didn't the king have to enter his own castle from the back yard?
Take the tank away!
What?
What the hell?
Come on!
Are you ready?
Get behind the lever!
Roger!
Fuck! Where is he?
This bastard destroyed the tank all by himself!
Captain!
Captain Buccaneer!
So, the master is back.
Open the door.
Open it, Farman-Kun.
I'm sorry, Colonel Mustang.
I think I'm out of the game.
Don't cry like a girl when you do a man's deed.
Although there is no one braver than me.
I can still fight.
How stupid.
This is what people call heroism.
Exactly.
Barely flame speeches and jumps to the ambrosia can change anything.
But you know, for some reason, when I see something like this, I can't stay away.
I see, something like this, I can't stay away.
Fullmetal Alchemist.
Sounded for free from the site anidap.com
Damn!
Stop, Lapure, turn around, his sixes are here like here.
If we miss them, they will take the main gate.
We need to hold on to the end.
Yes.
Got it?
Is this true?
Madame Bradley, his Excellency is alive.
He's back.
Thank God.
Are you okay?
Are you okay?
Yes.
Now yes.
Thank God he's alive.
Is he not wounded?
It is not known yet.
His Excellency is fighting with the Briggs group at the headquarters.
We will have to send all the dogs to Briggs, but for the sake of Colonel Mustang.
Yes.
It's good that his Excellency is alive.
Yes.
God bless Selim too.
If he is fighting with the Briggs troops, it turns out that Lieutenant General Armstrong has begun the coup.
Armstrong?
Ah, the woman who was recently transferred to the capital.
I wonder how many people from the Supreme Command are on her side.
So he's still alive?
This should have been expected from the homunculus.
It seems that our plan to give ourselves to the Fuhrer's successors failed.
I can't believe I had to set up Lieutenant General.
It's getting dangerous here too.
Exactly.
What will happen to us now?
I don't know.
After all, it is assumed that we are on the side of the Fuhrer.
I don't think they will attack us without negotiations.
But if Bradley has already managed to give them an order ...
I don't know.
But if Bradley has already managed to give them an order ...
We won't be able to stay here for long.
But we have his wife.
Do you think this will stop them?
How many years, how many winters.
You should have run away while there was a chance.
Unfortunately, my greed does not know the limits.
And now I want to take your life once.
You are on our side?
The whole city is buzzing with rumors that you died during the explosion of the train.
How did you survive?
I am an absolute eye for a reason.
I saw perfectly where to run to get through the falling stones.
But years take their own.
And my body is not what it used to be.
And yet he was able to do such a thing.
You are Lingyao, right?
Oh, it seems we haven't seen each other since I hid in your apartment, right?
How are you, Pastor Farman?
I'm already a junior lieutenant.
And then you gave me blood and food.
It's time to pay back the debt.
Where are you going?
I have personal accounts for this.
Do you want to take advantage of my blind spot?
My partner explained to me how to fight you.
Really?
What do you say to that?
He retreats.
Bad news.
Fire!
Fire!
Better not to climb, morons!
Damn it!
Captain!
You have a strong grip.
You will not play with your blade anymore.
Did you hit the end?
Although...
Great job!
Well...
I'm not very used to fighting with such a weapon.
Not bad, old man.
Fire!
Has his superiority returned?
Yes.
He has entered the fight with an unknown enemy.
Let's go.
Gather the troops immediately and destroy the Briggs soldiers.
We must help the Fuhrer.
Rearm the soldiers.
We must return the central gates.
Yes!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Damn it!
Central army on the approach!
I'm sorry, my hands are a little busy now.
Take care of them yourself.
What?
I wonder how to do it myself?
How to go up?
I see.
Hold on, captain.
I have to take advantage of them.
Hey!
Take the captain Bacanir to a safe place.
Yes!
We need to move them.
Yes!
Damn it!
They stopped us with only two machine guns.
The height gives them a huge advantage.
Can you contact those who are inside the headquarters now?
Order them to open the gates from the inside.
Yes!
Says the 3rd Guard Battalion.
Guard the central headquarters.
Answer!
Artificial soldiers are still at the eastern gates.
What?
Repeat!
Give it to me!
Commander of the Guard Battalion, Gamran.
We are at the main gates.
Can you open the gates of the headquarters from the inside?
No way!
Artificial soldiers are still at the headquarters.
Artificial soldiers?
What are you talking about?
What is it?
What's going on?
Enemy reinforcements?
What's going on down there?
Fort Podtrino
Oh my guy!
Thank you, it's just in time.
I came to help not you, but young master.
You know, I feel your rage only coming out of the body of young master.
Thank to it, I found you.
But who is this man, who doesn't even care about our strongest attacks?
King Bradley.
Oh, come on, it's the first time I see him with my own eyes.
So it's because of him that my granddaughter lost her hand!
Oh, come on, it's the first time I see him with my own eyes.
So it's because of him that my granddaughter lost her hand!
So it's because of him that my granddaughter lost her hand!
Oh, come on, it's the first time I see him with my own eyes!
So it's because of him that my granddaughter lost her hand!
The fragments of your memories
Disappear one by one
I want to be stronger than today
So that this voice will someday reach you
If I keep walking and the wind stops
I'll look for you and look up
The light will shine before dawn
The rainbow will shine
The end
The man understands the end of the battle when he knows his enemy and himself.
But he will not die for nothing.
Next time on Metal Alchemist, Episode 57
Eternal Tornado
Farewell, my lord.
I will watch over you, my lord.
