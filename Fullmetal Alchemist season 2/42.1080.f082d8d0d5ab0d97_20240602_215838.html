        <pre>Metal Alchemist
In the middle of an endless journey,
a time that seems to come to an end,
we sigh and sigh.
We tried to grasp it, but it was still far away.
But now there is nothing to be afraid of.
The strong bonds that bind our hearts
will never be broken.
We continue to search,
and we have reached
this place, this period.
The light of sadness changes into power,
and destiny is right next to us.
Metal Alchemist
Meichen, look at this expression again.
Yes, it means gold.
What are you doing?
We are trying to understand if there is a hidden message here.
Hidden message?
Alchemists often encrypt their research
using the language of symbols and metaphors
so that ordinary people could not read them.
But we never managed to find the key
necessary to solve the code.
Therefore, we decided to look at the note again,
paying special attention to the expression
that means gold and immortality.
And we managed to find something.
Nothing.
Where am I?
Al! Alcama!
Thank God!
I was afraid that you would never wake up.
I'm sorry I made you worry.
By the way, why did they take me apart?
We had no choice.
You are too big and heavy to carry you whole.
That's why we split your body.
I'm sorry I made you worry so much.
Has this happened to you before?
Yes, when I was looking for you.
Well, it's probably not very pleasant for you
to be disassembled into pieces.
Let me collect you.
Yes, thank you.
Here, hold it for now.
Okay.
This seems to be the right one.
Oh, right.
Let's group the pieces first.
Group the pieces.
Wait, Meichan!
Oh no, what are you doing?
Why did you scatter all the pages on the floor?
I thought about it.
What if we group the pages
according to the suggestion
containing the words gold and immortality?
Gold Man.
This letter is here.
Immortality.
It's here.
The Invincible Man.
Oh, it's here.
Give me that page, Mark.
It's here.
There's another one with the gold man.
Yes, here it is.
And finally the last one.
And finally the last one.
Is this it?
This is it.
Their circle for creating a stone.
Only time is wasted.
What does it mean?
Do you want to say that these researches are absolutely useless?
It's a joke!
Now we...
No, the whole country will fly to Tartarara.
I'm sorry.
And what I was just thinking about.
I hope that we will be saved by the researches of another person.
Brother, is this what you wanted to tell me?
You dedicated your whole life to your researches.
And this is all you got?
There must be something else.
After all, we did not immediately understand that we need to group the pages.
I'm sure we haven't fully solved this riddle yet.
What?
This is a joke!
What have you done?
It's not my fault, it's too cold here.
Besides, I'm cold.
So what's wrong with you?
I don't remember what side she was on.
Because of you they all turned over.
Exactly!
The position in which we are, you need to turn your feet to the head.
Leave the pages in their places, but turn them to the other side.
Well?
You were right.
This is a new circle that activates Amestris.
The new Amestris, with the help of alchemy and rentanjitsu.
Episode 42, signal to counterattack.
It doesn't seem like people have passed through here.
It seems that I made a mistake in the road and I have to return.
What?
I see.
They used it to take out the construction waste from the sloth's tunnel.
I suppose you are a great alchemist.
I'm glad to meet you. My name is Pride.
You have a lot to do with me.
How are the search for the scar progressing?
Right now I'm chasing it.
Forget about it for now.
First you have to cut out the blood seal on Briggs.
It will not be so easy to make the true strength of the Briggs soldiers in their unity.
They always remain a united body.
Then just take advantage of their strength.
The sloth tunnel is almost complete.
All right, I'll cut out the blood seal for you.
On the Briggs mountains.
I've been waiting for you!
Any news?
Nothing important.
There are rumors that Kimbley has disappeared. Is that true?
Yes.
The tunnel collapsed by a powerful explosion.
Kimbley and a few others disappeared without a trace.
We've been searching for a few days, but we haven't found any traces.
Among those few people, were there Briggs soldiers?
No.
These are two handcrafted Kimbleys.
And an all-metal alchemist.
So that's what an all-metal boss looks like.
I hope everything is fine with him.
Me too.
How's it going in the West?
The war is going on all over the border of Pendleton.
It feels like their goal is to put as many people as possible here, and not to win.
As you say, the army is provoking bloody battles right along the border of the Underground Transforming Circle.
Have you heard anything from Fury?
I talked to him on the phone recently.
He was sent to the most hellish battle with the Aerog's troops in the south of Fawcett.
Run, Thomas!
Don't stop!
Damn it!
They can't get me!
I swear to God, I'll survive!
That's how it is.
It's not very secretive.
That's how it is.
It's not very secretive to complain about the old Mustang dogs.
Any news from the colonel?
Yes.
He keeps me informed about the connection with the Armstrong family.
I see.
It looks like something is happening in the North, too.
Don't lose your vigilance.
How can you lose it here?
The bastard who wants to send this country straight to the devil is making his plan right in front of us, and we can't stop him.
I've connected them.
Can I have a rest now, Pride?
There's not much left.
That day is near.
It's available for free.

Guys!
It's time for lunch!
Get in line!
Rose, will you bake a meat pie next time?
Definitely, if we get the right products.
I'll be looking forward to it.
I can't work anymore, but I'm asking you to feed these children.
Of course.
It's enough for you, Granny.
It smells so good.
Can I add some roses?
No, everyone is equal.
I'm sorry.
Can I have some, too?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Can I have some, too?
You saved my life.
Thank you.
It was very tasty.
Where did you come from?
How can I say?
I'm a wanderer.
But why did you come here?
Didn't you hear that Leor was destroyed during the uprising?
Now there's nothing left here.
Don't tell me there's still hot food here.
Thank you for the compliment.
But that's all I can help you with now.
Don't be so modest.
The warm food you cook and your smile gives these people the strength to move forward.
What?
Oh, yes.
You saved my life, but I need to find a church.
A church?
Yes, the church of Leto, the one where the uprising began.
Here it is.
Actually, here it is.
All valuable things have already been taken out of here.
And there were no underground tunnels in the church.
Yes, there is one, but...
So what do we have here?
A poisonous lake.
It was already like this when we found it.
So the road to the ordinary man has been ordered there.
Then...
Wait! This water will kill you!
A miracle!
No, this is alchemy.
I'll go take a look there. Wait for me here.
Wow!
Wow!
The tunnel has been destroyed.
He found me quickly.
Damn it!
I hope...
This will stop him.
Well, well...
Bad luck.
Well, well...
What's wrong with you?
Did you change your mind to kill me?
What?
This face...
You're Van Hoenheim, aren't you?
Looks like you can't get behind this line.
What?
You'll die if you cross it.
Another border that you can't cross?
As in the test.
You can only move through the capital and through this tunnel.
Am I right?
You're an apple, aren't you?
What's wrong?
Say something!
You're the eternal Kikikomori!
Are you angry?
I have neither anger nor anger.
And not only anger.
Our father got rid of all useless feelings.
My name is Pride.
Pride.
That means pride.
It's pleasant to think that there are seven mortal sins.
Hatred.
Greed.
Lazy.
Greed.
Envy.
Anger.
And pride.
Pride.
The first thing he got rid of was you, Pride.
It's funny that he made you the same as he was when he lived in the test room.
He was always very proud of his shape, and the apple fell not far from the apple.
Do you want to see your father?
Why are you in such a hurry?
When the time comes, I'll come to him.
Tell your father that slave number 23 will stop him.
And while he can make himself comfortable and relax and wait.
Got it?
I'll be waiting for you.
Van Hoenheim.
He's coming back.
Did you find anything?
Yes.
No one should go there anymore.
Tell everyone that it's deadly dangerous.
What were you doing there?
Huh?
Announced the war.
Let's exchange.
Finally, the storm broke off like a chain.
Let's go and eat this shit, which is not called coffee.
Good luck, guys.
Hey!
It can't be!
It's...
The army of Drachma!
Drachma has begun a military invasion!
Take combat positions!
I repeat!
Drachma has begun a military invasion!
Take combat positions!
The North Stone of Brix
We're lucky that the North Stone of Brix has left its fortress unattended.
Yes, comrade Kimble?
Moreover, there are our people inside the fortress.
When the battle begins, they will put Brix in chaos according to my command.
Today we will do the impossible!
The non-criminal Brix will fall at the feet of Drachma!
Today I will make a strategy!
It's time to declare war solemnly!
Let's arrange a salute that they will never forget!
Forward!
Full combat readiness!
Fire!
Fire!
Fire!
Fire!
Fire!
To be continued...
Yes, my name is Zanpano.
My name is Zanpano.
I work for Kimble.
Dr. Marco is now hiding in the North West of Uzbekistan.
Thank you for the information, Zanpano.
We guarantee your safety.
Marco!
The fun begins again!
The kingdom leads to tragedy, and pride does not cause pain.
But through this you need to go through to be reborn.
Next time, in a solid metal alchemist,
Ibizot 43, the bite of an insect,
the snow will be painted in the color of blood,
the blood will be shed,
the blood will be shed,
the blood will be shed.
