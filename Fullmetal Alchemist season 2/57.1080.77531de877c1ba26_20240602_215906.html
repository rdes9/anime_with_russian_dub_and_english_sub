This is how it is called in alchemy.
The people of Amestris will not die.
He will live forever,
remaining a part of us.
And together we will build a new world!
One has everything and everything is one!
Here we are, the chosen Amestris!
This is one!
You heard him.
How do you like it?
Do you think what they are going to do
is right?
Will you let them do it?
You all have to come with me!
If you only listen to him ...
We are soldiers, we swore to believe
in the orders of the commander and fulfill them.
But to be honest, I don't know anymore
what to believe in.
I can't believe that you still doubt.
Do you understand?
The performance of the orders of the passers-by
is not the loyalty of the oath.
This is self-deception!
Believe in yourself!
Choose the path that
your heart tells you!
I have a family in the city.
I also have a family.
Major General!
This is our answer!
Commander, report the situation.
We have problems.
The enemy's fresh forces continue
to attack in all directions.
Where are you, General?
In the Fuhrer's office.
Do you have survivors?
Connection with our troops in this zone is lost.
Most likely they are surrounded.
I see.
When you are not able to hold the position,
leave.
I understand you.
Well, the headquarters is starting
to flood with enemies again.
When they appear here,
it's just a matter of time.
Then?
If we go down deep enough,
I can make a tunnel
through which we get out of here.
Run away?
Don't argue.
You all need a break.
It's close.
Did you notice it too?
How did you feel it?
It's just a bad feeling.
It's like the teeth of old wounds.
Teras!
I didn't expect to see someone here.
I'm so excited.
Who are you?
Me?
I'm the one who created
King Bradley.
I'm the one who created
King Bradley.
I think I can say that.
It's important.
In other words,
you are our enemy.
Oh, what people.
I thought he was still on the radio station,
and you came to me yourself.
How kind of you,
Mustang-kun.
You will win
a little time for me.
Who is this?
Dolls again?
They move in a completely different way
than you brainless dolls.
These are those who could not
become King Bradley.
They lived here from birth
and went through the most intense training.
I hope to become
the ruler of the country.
But during the experiment,
King Bradley became candidate number 12.
So the others
were not needed.
However,
their whole life was continuous
and training.
Let them not compare
with King Bradley,
but they are strong enough.
Damn you!
Damn you!
That's shit!
Looks like I got knocked out.
Captain!
Exactly!
If I pull him out,
I will die from blood loss.
Bradley!
Did you kill me, old man?
I'm sorry, young master.
Don't be angry!
Damn you!
It is not often that you can meet
a worthy opponent.
You move well,
despite the fact
that you are older than me.
But...
Our battle is over.
Old man!
Old man!
Is it Prince again?
Damn you, Link!
We must warn him!
Just like that girl
who cut off her hand.
You risk your own life
instead of sacrificing someone.
Don't talk nonsense!
That's exactly what
King Bradley would have done.
The king lives for the sake of his people.
There will be no people
without a king.
And he is ready to sacrifice
all the inhabitants of his country.
I don't want to become
such a ruler as he is!
So he is not worthy
to be called a king.
We cannot lose to him.
Don't talk!
You need rest!
Exactly!
Rest!
It's time for me
to rest a little.
Your shield, Grid!
Protect the body of the young master!
My prince,
fulfill your dream!
And this old man
has to rest forever!
No, you fool!
You will go with me
to Bradley!
No, you fool!
You will go with me
to Bradley!
You will go with me
to Bradley!
I couldn't even
hurt him
for the rest of my life!
Forgive me,
but I have one wish.
Even if you have
the eyes of God,
you will not be able
to reflect the attack
that is hidden from them!
Old man,
we will not
turn him into hell together!
I will go with you!
I am your debtor!
Grandfather!
It's for free!

Damn!
First you went into the pit,
and now into the lantern!
My grandmother is the best
bald idiot!
Shut up!
Say thank you
that we managed to go so far
on this bucket!
Stop swearing!
We need to find the way
to the tunnel
before it's too late!
Wow!
Colonel Mustang's work?
I hope they are all right!
Brother!
We need to hurry!
It doesn't matter
how strong they are!
They are also people!
Look around, Colonel!
Why do I need you?
The Door of Truth!
It's the truth!
You are a great man!
The door of truth!
I have a great
good friend!
You are a great friend!
You are a great friend!
You are a great friend!
This is a secret hidden behind the ban on human transformation.
The alchemist who has done this opens the door.
But he must pay for it.
So the Elric brothers paid with their bodies?
And you?
I took part of the internal organs.
But I took an important lesson from it.
The dead man can no longer be returned.
I was talking too much.
I guess I'm interested in military talks like this.
So those who have already opened the door to the truth, they are called valuable victims?
Perhaps this will help us figure out the enemy's plan.
So each of you lost a person for whom you were ready to open the door.
Do you understand what you have to pay for it?
And you?
Do you have a person for whom you would give everything?
This is just not a conversation for the military.
It's stupid to love the dead.
After all, we are fighting to protect those who are still alive.
I think you are right.
But...
I think I understand something.
When I first met Edward Elric, I threatened him and demanded that he tell everything he knew.
But this boy did not tell me that his friend was held hostage.
He constantly said the same thing.
Try to understand.
His eyes were not like ours, soldiers.
And even more so not like the alchemists, who are called army dogs.
I would say that these are the eyes of a man who is ready to do anything to protect those who are dear to him.
These were the eyes of a naive child.
I will lie if I say that I was not touched by sincerity in his eyes.
But will his childish ideals help him get out of this battle alive?
Or will they destroy him?
Ready.
Well, the time has come.
Number 16, number 17, number 21, number 23, number 26.
Come here.
What else?
Let's start!
What have you done?
Nothing, it was just the first step.
Do you know how many laboratory laboratories are located in the capital under the control of the FÃ¼hrer?
There are four laboratories in the city now.
No!
The fifth laboratory.
Five!
A pentagonal transformational circle!
Could it be that the tunnels that pass under the laboratories are the basis of the circle?
What the hell?
What happened, Heinkel-san?
Izumi.
Yes, I think it's time.
I'll make a tunnel in this wall, step back a few steps.
In this case, we will part here.
We have one unfinished business here.
The enemy is already close.
It is impossible to miss such an opportunity for a sudden attack.
You are...
I owe you.
Thank you, Izumi Curtis.
Ivan, General Arms.
What?
Alfonskun!
Izumi!
Izumi!
All-metal!
