Today
Shuttle once again appeared in the capital.
ED is
However...
Ranfan!
Oh, so you managed to change the direction of the blow with your kunai.
Can I eat it?
Just quickly.
Ha-ha-ha!
Ranfan, hold on!
Do you think you'll be able to escape from me?
Oh, that's how a experienced fighter looks like.
He's always trying to strike from the side of my dead zone.
Swallow!
Yes!
Now that no one will see us,
I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Who are you? What is your goal?
How did you find out what's inside the gluttony?
Are you still hoping to escape?
I think you'll have a chance to save your skin if you throw out the extra luggage.
Luggage means...
You're the most important person in this country, aren't you?
FÃ¼hrer King Bradley, if I'm not mistaken.
But kings live for the sake of their people.
King Bradley, you will never become a true king!
What a naivety!
There are no true kings.
You rely too much on your vision.
Judging by the path, the exit should be...
Surprised?
Surprised?
You know, I have this eye, too.
Episode 22, Far Silhouettes
Winry, we'll be back soon.
So, have you made up your mind?
Winry-chan!
We're back!
Episode 22, Far Silhouettes
For me, Hughes-san was like a father to me.
I visited him from time to time.
He never liked to be alone.
Gracie-san...
I heard the Elric brothers are fighting with someone.
Again?
All the military police are watching!
Who are they dealing with this time?
It looks like they're fighting with the murderers and state alchemists.
Haven't they caught him yet?
And where is the army looking?
No, it can't be!
Damn it!
What a scum!
Great job, brother!
Run faster!
Can we shoot now?
Not yet, Seth.
What the hell is going on here?
Link hasn't sent a signal yet.
And the brother is starting to get tired.
We need to wait a little longer.
Sharam!
You're the one who uses alchemy!
Why do you hate alchemists so much
and think that they rebelled against God?
I answered this question in the Eastern city.
If there are no creators, there must be destroyers.
You?
You're just using the name of God to justify your crimes!
And Nina is using the name of God to justify her crimes!
Nina, you killed Nina in the name of God too, didn't you?
So you saw this alchemist too.
And you still admire alchemy,
the art of creating, which caused such a tragedy?
You did it with your own hands, brother!
What you call the art of creation,
did it turn an innocent girl into an alchemist?
So be it!
But why did you kill her?
Who gave you the right to take her life?
I'm sure you understand that.
That girl couldn't be returned to her former form.
Don't kill her then,
and she would spend the rest of her life like an inexperienced rabbit.
You would never treat her like a human being.
Indeed, then we were also afraid that they would put experiments on Nina.
But we only put aside the problem that could not be solved.
We didn't do anything.
Nothing.
Your truth.
We alchemists make mistakes.
But that doesn't mean that your crimes can be justified.
Do you remember the Amistris family of doctors Rockbell?
During the Civil War,
they went to the front to treat the Shvaritovs
and stayed with their patients even after that.
Stop, brother!
Do you remember the people who saved your life
and who you, son of a bitch, killed for it?
Brother!
What did you say?
Winry.
This man killed his father?
Yes.
This man killed his father?
And his mother?
He killed them?
How could it be?
He killed them?
Who did they save?
Why?
What did they do to you?
What did they do to deserve this?
What did they do to deserve this?
Give them back!
Give me back my father and mother!
Stop, Winry!
No!
You can't give them back!
Winry!
Please, stop!
I understand what you're feeling,
but revenge only results in a greater thirst for revenge.
Have mercy on the past.
You can watch this for free on www.anidap.com
So you're the daughter of those doctors?
You have the full right to kill me.
Brother!
Brother!
Brother!
The army is already close!
Forget about your research.
We need to...
Wait, I'm almost done.
What are these tattoos?
Oh, these.
Alchemy is the analysis of destruction and recreation.
My right hand serves for destruction,
and the left one is for recreation.
I studied Ren Tanjutsu and was able to adapt it to my body.
But I also found out
that the alchemy of this country hides something terrible.
So what?
We don't have time!
Hey!
Why did you stop me?
We need to get out of here immediately!
Please calm down.
Your brother's research can save you.
What?
You heard about state alchemists.
They say they were brought here as living weapons,
and they have the same power that will tear you off the face of the earth,
despite the fact that we are also citizens of Amestris.
I know.
But what does it have to do with my brother?
Your brother has opened the way to incredible power,
superior to the power of state alchemists,
to the power that can destroy their army.
With the power that they never dreamed of,
we will pay them back with the same coin,
and Amestris will choke to death.
Do you see, brother?
This is the alchemy that you dedicated your life to.
Even if you believe that it should bring people happiness.
Others just want it to kill.
Come on.
Is this alchemy?
Do you really believe that something like this can save Ishvar?
The only thing that can save Ishvar is what can cause death and destruction.
Oh no!
Father! Mother!
Are you alive?
Yes, everything is fine.
Fortunately, we were ready to run.
You made it!
I was collecting the most important records, so I was a little late.
The most important?
Take care of them.
What is this?
My research.
This is all I managed to save.
Take them and run away from here.
Wait!
If something happens to me, then all the research will be lost.
Then why don't you run with them yourself?
You are an unsurpassed warrior-monk, who has gone through the most cruel training.
You have much more chances to survive than I do.
Look.
My legs don't stop shaking.
Don't you dare touch me, older brother.
Brother?
Military!
Transforming circles?
This is a state alchemist!
Lie down!
Don't you dare die!
Damn you!
Blood doesn't stop!
His hand!
Where's my brother's hand?
Where's my brother's hand?
Run!
Run!
Run!
Run!
Run!
Run!
Run!
Run!
Run!
Run!
Run!
Run!
Run!
Where's my brother's hand?
Where's my brother's hand?
Where's my brother's hand?
Dad!
Mom!
Where are you?
Somebody!
Live!
You can't die!
I'll show them what Ishivara people are worth!
If you really want to do this, then run!
Exactly!
I treated you not to let you die like this!
You too, Doc!
You and your wife need to leave!
We're leaving here only with the last patient!
Brother!
Lie down!
You fool!
You locked me up with you!
Brother!
Everyone who can move on their own, run!
He woke up!
Don't move!
Your wounds will open again!
Darling!
Come here!
You need rest!
Somebody!
Find the stretcher!
Please take him with you!
Brother!
Thank God!
He was saved!
What's going on?
Calm down!
It's over!
We stabbed the last boy!
You're state alchemists!
And we're stress!
I'm sorry!
You bastards!
Dr. Rockbell!
Shoot!
Don't shoot, Winry!
Drop the gun!
You shouldn't take the gun in your hand!
Winry!
Shoot!
But as soon as you drop the rock, you'll become my enemy!
Scram!
If you even touch Winry with your finger!
What?
Will you kill me?
Come on!
The chains of hatred will not break until the end of time!
Winry!
Winry!
Winry!
The chains of hatred will not break until one of us dies!
But don't forget!
You made the first shot in the Civil War!
Amestrists!
No!
Don't shoot!
Drop the gun and get out of here!
Winry!
If you can't shoot, get out of here!
You're in my way!
Don't shoot!
Lie down!
Brother!
Stupid brother!
What are you doing?
Do you want both of them killed?
Get Winry out of here!
Winry, drop the gun!
You couldn't shoot!
Please, don't shoot!
I'm begging you, don't shoot!
Winry!
Winry!
Winry!
Just don't shoot!
I'm begging you!
But...
He killed mom and dad!
And then he ran away!
Why did you do that?
You were born in Rashville
You saved mom and her child
You gave me a hand and a leg so I could get up again
Your hands shouldn't kill people
They should help them live
That's why
To be continued
To be continued
To be continued
To be continued
Should a man follow the principles to protect someone?
And those who are not ready for this are doomed to defeat and death?
No
The desire to protect gives strength, capable of defeating any enemy
