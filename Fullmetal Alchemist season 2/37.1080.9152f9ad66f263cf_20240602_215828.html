        <pre>I'm not able to concentrate, my body is still lost. I was trembling, even if I controlled it, it shook. The sun and the moon are not facing me completely, but I have no choice but to do it. I muttered so as to make you say it.
The situation is bad, but I don't have the guts to just run away. I don't have a tempo, but I have no choice but to clear it with anger.

Who are they? They are hand-made Kimblis sent from the capital to protect the girl Rock-Belle.
What the hell are you going to do in Briggs, Kimble?
Episode 37, the first homunculus
You should have told me that you were going north. I didn't have time, we were in a hurry.
You two are always in a hurry.
And by the way, why are you in prison?
It's just a misunderstanding. They will be released very soon.
I just have to make some formalities.
Thank you, Kimblis. Please take a look at them.
Of course.
Hey, don't trust Kimble like that.
Why is he so polite and well-mannered?
Rock-Belle-san.
After all, these are your parents, the famous pair of doctors who died in Shuwar.
Yes, I thought so.
When my squad found their bodies.
Unfortunately, we were late. When we arrived at the scene, the Shuwarites were already ...
That's how.
They were real doctors and did their duty to the end.
I sincerely admire them.
I would like to meet them while they are still alive.
They took care of the photos that were taken with the little girl.
She was very dear to them.
It is a great honor for me to meet you, Winry Rock-Belle-san.
Do you even know what he did in Shuwar?
Everything I know about Shuwar was told by the senior lieutenant.
Senior lieutenant?
You love Winry, don't you?
Concentrate and calm down. Just think of something else, Ed.
Hydrogen, helium, lithium, beryllium, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, thor, Ed.
Magnesium, aluminum, vanadium, chrome, margonite, iron, cobalt, nickel.
And how did I get into such a mess?
Did you say something?
No, nothing.
Damn it, warn me before connecting the nerves.
Okay, okay, now the leg.
It's so light.
And because of this, there will be no problems with strength.
The total strength, of course, decreased, but I increased the most important details.
Why aren't you in the cell, bastard?
Who knows?
I'm a state alchemist for a reason.
Have you finally been re-equipped for the North?
I see you have a new one too.
I'm not going to win with her.
Oh, this is the lighted-up battle armor M1910.
What? Only the ends of the legs are reinforced.
Exactly, this is the latest M1910, mad bear.
Ed, Ed, do you want me to make you the same?
Not really.
Who is this cute lady?
My mechanic.
I'm not going to win with her.
I'm not going to win with her.
I'm not going to win with her.
Oh, I'm a rogue for an evil reason.
What the hell is this?
You're pissing me off, bastard.
Bastard.
I'm so happy to see the North auto armor for the first time.
Right?
Do you want to see my workplace?
I do, I do, I do.
Hey.
What?
Well, don't lose your vigilance and don't hang out here.
Okay, I won't.
Thank you for allowing me to see everything here.
This is a very rare toy.
Wow, this is a crocodile!
Like her parents, she gives everything at work.
I use a combination of carbon and fiberglass, and during welding ...
Now that your car is adapted to the north ...
It's time to talk about work.
Whole metal alchemist Dono.
Excuse me, why don't you let me out?
This is Kimble's order.
We were told to release only the whole metal alchemist.
So these are the people of Kimble.
They are deliberately trying to divide us.
They even brought Winry here to remind us that she is in their hands.
They control each of us.
We can't just sit and wait.
We need to look for our chance.
The provision of the front squad was a maximum of three days.
But it's been a whole week.
They can handle it.
I'm more worried about their minds.
Spend a whole week in the dark.
Let's believe in the power of their spirit.
General, we don't know who they are.
If we don't come back in 24 hours, close the passage.
I understand.
I'll do it.
Listen to me, everyone.
I personally decided to kill General Raven.
None of you saw anything and didn't hear.
If everything comes out, I'll be responsible for it.
Yes, ma'am.
Godspeed.
It's getting hot in the north.
Yes, it's time to make our move.
Briggs's element is defense.
The winner is the one who has the initiative.
To do this, you need not only to be able to hold the blow, but also to attack.
That's why Olivia decided that uniting with the Eastern Army, whose element of attack is the best choice.
What an honor for me to be chosen by her partner.
It's not quite like that.
Olivia herself said that she only needs the strength of the Eastern Army.
And Mustang can at least fall through the ground.
How?
Can I ask you one question?
What will she do if I want to sell this information to the Fuhrer?
It's excluded.
Mustang is not that kind of person.
That's what she said.
You have 35,200 cents.
I'm sorry.
Look.
You didn't even introduce yourself.
I'm an ordinary flower girl who has served many generations of the Armstrong dynasty.
You know, Hughes, you seem to be the only person who understands me.
It's those with whom we fought shoulder to shoulder.
And now?
What should I do with these flowers?
Oh, you're so ridiculous.
God, he's looking at us.
Horrible.
Who are you?
Horrible.
The same as with Smith's hand.
Not a single metal is capable of cutting like that.
Quiet. The enemy may be somewhere nearby.
Who's there?
Don't be afraid.
You see, it's me.
Lieutenant Hensel.
Thank God you're alive.
There are only two of us.
What about the others?
They're all torn to pieces.
We need to get out of here quickly.
It's coming back.
Turn off the light.
The shadow is approaching.
Calm down.
Hey, hold on to your hands.
Shadow!
You can get up. We're leaving.
Take everyone you can.
I'm sorry to bother you at such a late hour.
We urgently need to deliver these documents to His Excellency.
Oh my God, I'm sorry.
But my husband is not here right now.
I need him to get acquainted with this until tomorrow.
Until tomorrow?
I'll give it to him.
I'll be very grateful.
Selim, are you still awake?
Yes, I heard the creaking of the door and thought that Dad had come back.
This is Senior Lieutenant Hawkeye.
Good evening, Hawkeye-san.
Nice to meet you.
Do you work even at such an hour?
Yes, I brought important documents to his father.
I'm sorry to wake you up.
Well, let's go, Selim-sama.
It's time for you to go to bed, otherwise you will sleep tomorrow.
Yes?
Your son is so funny.
He is my joy and pride.
If he were our own son, I would be criticized for being too naughty.
But he is a nice boy, I can boast about him as much as I want.
It must be this friendship that Selim passed on from Bradley's family.
Isn't he your distant relative?
No?
The Colonel said that King Bradley was a orphan and even a child became part of the experiment.
He can't have relatives.
And that terrible feeling.
Who is this child?
So you guessed it.
Just look at her.
My mom is so chatty.
This feeling of unbeatable thirst for blood.
I've already experienced something like this before.
And now I remembered.
I remember.
The same feeling I had when Hagamu Kuglothani was standing behind my back.
Selim Bradley.
What are you?
You have jealous cold blood.
Ask me about it in similar situations, Senior Lieutenant.
And the fact that you didn't take the gun was the right decision.
You can't beat me.
You can't beat me.
You can't beat me.
You can't beat me.
You can't beat me.
You can't beat me.
You can't beat me.
You can't beat me.
So you are just same like Hagomu Kuglothani?
No.
I feel it.
The strength of Hagomu Kuglothani cannot be compared with yours.
Indeed.
It's unimaginable to even think that I am the same level as him.
I am the first one.
My name is Pride.
The first homunculus? What does it mean exactly what I said to her?
Are you trying to get as much information out of me as possible? You're a desperate person.
Do you want to join us?
To you?
You want to pay another pawn? That's it? That's a pity.
Then...
Maybe that's enough meaningless threats.
You won't get anything by killing the hostage.
You're really smart.
But remember, Senior Lieutenant Hawkeye, I will constantly be watching you from the shadows.
Work, you say?
Yes, work.
The FÃ¼hrer gave three orders.
The first is to search for the scar. Your only task is to find it.
I'll deal with him myself.
The second is to find Mark, who probably ran away with the scar.
Dr. Mark with the scar?
You just have to find him. The rest is up to you.
Dr. Mark with the scar?
You just have to find him. The rest is up to me.
And finally, the third.
Here in Briggs, you have to cut out the blood seal.
Cut out the blood seal?
We'll do the same here in Ishwar.
By spilling blood, we will fill this land with hatred and suffering.
For nothing!
Having become an army son, you weren't ready to kill?
Having become a family, you decided not to kill anyone?
You decided not to kill?
Is this also a good path if you believe him to the end?
Working for the army, did you know what they were thinking?
After all, they...
I want to see what the new world will be like.
Idea against idea, life against life, will against will, people against homunculus.
Who will win? Who will choose this world?
If people are destroyed by new people, then they were not strong enough to survive in the world.
I wonder how it will end.
Then why are you, a human, on the side of the homunculus?
Because, staying with them, I can not hold back the power of my alchemy.
Yeretic.
Exactly, for this world I am a heretic.
But if someone like me can survive, then the world recognized me.
Survive, fight for existence.
There is nothing more beautiful than this.
I do not think so.
Oh, what a pity.
It always seemed to me that alchemists are the most selfish people.
Let's try to turn to your selfish side.
This is what you want the most in the world.
If you complete the task, it is yours.
Philosopher's Stone.
I have to discuss this with Salam and Winry.
With Winry-san?
I did not tell her anything before.
It does not matter what work I have to do.
I can not hide the truth from her anymore.
Okay.
I'll make you a company to make sure you do not say anything unnecessary.
Winry, you were taken hostage.
What?
What are you talking about?
Is this a joke?
Listen to me.
I have an order. I must become a living weapon.
That means I have to kill people.
What?
Just give up.
So why me?
Why?
I'm in the way of you all the time.
I do not cry.
I'm sorry.
I'm so angry at myself for not knowing what's going on.
Why?
You just want to get your bodies back.
By the way,
I'll get a Philosopher's Stone if we agree.
What?
Stone?
But he's with Kimble.
No, I want to say that he's done.
I know.
Damn!
Do what you want.
And I'll do it.
This is work.
I'll take care of her.
But let me find Sharama first.
What is this?
Sharama killed Winry's parents.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Sharama killed Winry's parents.
He has to pay for this.
I understand.
I agree.
I need Al to come with me.
Sharama's attacks do not work on him.
Really?
It will come in handy.
Al, everything is fine.
To create a Philosopher's Stone,
many people were sacrificed.
Don't be afraid.
Brother will not use it for anything.
We are looking for an opportunity
to return our bodies with the help of
Rintanjutsu Kusinga.
The girl who knows Rintanjutsu
is now with Sharama.
So she is the only reason
why he wants to find Sharama?
Yes, I think so.
It's clear.
Now I also have to come up with
a convincing reason.
Let's start looking for Basil.
Sharama saw him there last time.
Great.
Okay, move it.
Al, move a little more.
What the hell?
Maybe you'll wait for us in the fortress,
Winry-san.
This is not a fun walk.
I know.
But I just changed the car armor.
You will have problems if it breaks,
and there will be no mechanics to fix it.
If something happens to you,
it will forever be covered with the shame
of the name of the Rockbells.
Oh my God, you really are
a hard worker.
I'm proud of my job.
My family has been doing this
since ancient times.
Okay, I got it.
I know. You can come with us.
The family of choked mechanics.
Call me a choked mechanic as much as you want.
I don't know what can happen there.
I know.
But I don't want
to sit and wait anymore.
I don't want to sit and wait anymore.
I don't want to sit and wait anymore.
I don't want to sit and wait anymore.
I don't want to sit and wait anymore.
I don't want to sit and wait anymore.
I don't want to sit and wait anymore.
I don't want to sit and wait anymore.
I don't want to sit and wait anymore.
I don't want to sit and wait anymore.
I don't want to sit and wait anymore.
I don't want to sit and wait anymore.
I don't want to sit and wait anymore.
I don't want to sit and wait anymore.
I want to sit and wait anymore.
I want to sit and wait anymore.
I want to sit and wait anymore.
I want to sit and wait anymore.
I don't want to sit and wait anymore.
I don't want to sit and wait anymore.
I don't want to sit and wait anymore.
I don't want to sit and wait anymore.
I don't want to sit and wait anymore.
I don't want to sit and wait anymore.
I don't want to sit and wait anymore.
I don't want to sit and wait anymore.
I don't want to sit and wait anymore.
I don't want to sit and wait anymore.
I don't want to sit and wait anymore.
These songs, we're all singing them.
I'll be feeling better if you're there...
8. Battle in Basel
When a man feels that victory is in his pocket, he is the most vulnerable.
