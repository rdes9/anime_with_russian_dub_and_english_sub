        <pre>Alchemy is a science that studies the structure of matter, its rupture and recreation. However, it is not omnipotent, it does not allow to create something out of nothing.
In order to get something, it is necessary to replace something equal.
This is the principle of equal exchange, the main basis of alchemy.
Transformation of man is the main taboo of alchemy, and this prohibition is not allowed to violate anyone.
A solid metal alchemist.
The alchemist can be broken through inside, and could continue to be broken, but it is impossible.
Who are you waiting for in the color of your emotions?
I want to spit it out more honestly, as if I were stuck in a white cage
What do you want to escape from?
I want to scream that I'm living for the sake of reality
Can you hear me?
I can't do anything like good love
There is no place to go back to
I'm always in love with kindness
So I want to be strong
It makes me nostalgic
This pain is welcome
Miles Hughes is dead
He was killed by mysterious people with Uroboros tattoos
Mustang, suspecting that the top command of the army was involved in Hughes's death, decides to move to the capital
Meanwhile, not knowing anything about this, Ed and Al, together with Winry, go to the south of the town of Doblis, where their sensei lives
But...
Episode 11. The Miracle in Rushwell
Rushwell!
Auto armor! Auto armor! Auto armor!
Am I really in heaven?
This is Goatz, the model of the year 11
I couldn't even imagine that one day I would see her with my own eyes
What should I expect from some kind of auto armor?
It's everywhere
It's also a pleasure for me to spend the whole day on auto armor, and even on such a chain
We just had to leave Winry here and go further to Doblis
Hey, can I have a minute with you?
Great job!
That's right, guys, just look at this!
Hey, hey, what? Stop it, get off! I said stop it, but not there! No, no!
Is everyone so full of enthusiasm?
Get off me!
God, that's why I don't move the mechanics of auto armor
What the...
What happened?
There are no of them
No of what?
My certificate of the state alchemist of my silver watches
There are no of them
I'm sure it's a work of Nini
Nini?
She's a cashier and she's always stealing from tourists
Do you know where she can be?
Please, it's very important
I think I can tell you
Let me look at your auto armor one more time
The anal mechanic of auto armor named Nobunig
They said he lives deep in the mountains because you can find high-quality ore there
But is this really the right way?
Yes? They couldn't have lied to me, could they?
It's your fault. You wanted to get into this city so badly
If you weren't so greedy, you wouldn't have let me steal your silver watch
Shut up!
Hey, you both!
What do you want?
It's not that girl
I found you!
Give it back
Wow! Who are you?
I'm an alchemist!
Wow! Great!
Just like a monkey!
Come on!
I'm tired
I was waiting for you
Great job!
So, now you'll give them to me, my silver watch
What did you expect?
Remember in some city
What else?
A 40-millimeter barrel in my left leg
Stop!
Catch me if you can
I don't even think of running away
Good job, Swindler! Don't let her go!
I won't let you go until I see your gun!
Just think about Nina
Did you bring your friends?
Show me, show me
No, it's the first time I see such a gun
It's the first time I see such a gun
It's the first time I see such a gun
It's the first time I see such a gun
Excellent amortization, but most importantly, a real balance
And this rational design is a real work of art
What about my silver watches?
It's useless, brother
Allow me to express my deepest respect to the man who created such a great Avtobron
No, I'm not the one who made it
This is my job
Isn't it too heavy?
Yes, it is.
You can't put such a load on your body.
Maybe that's why he's so small.
Don't call me small!
Do you want to say that I will grow up if it will be easier?
Maybe.
Such a big brother!
You are so tall!
You are all nothing!
Don't call me small!
You are all nothing!
I have decided!
Dominic-san!
Please, take me as your student!
And don't dream!
Could you at least think a little about it?
Leave me alone! I don't take students!
I beg you!
Please teach her how to make a car armor that will help her not to grow up!
Get off me, you fool!
I'm sorry.
My father is very stubborn.
Poor...
Poor...
Poor...
Is that a baby?
Exactly!
Can I touch your belly?
Can I touch your belly?
Of course!
Unbelievable!
Just think about it!
We were exactly the same when mom was pregnant.
Are you all right?
Yes.
In bad weather, my knees start to hurt all the time.
What happened to your legs?
I lost my parents and legs in an railway accident.
I was left alone and lost my ability to walk.
I was sure that life would end.
Then I met Dominic-san.
I'm sorry.
Don't you think you're the most unfortunate person in the world?
I can't stand people like you!
Let me go!
With the eyes of a dead man.
I must have looked terrible back then.
It all ended with him raping me.
The operation was painful.
The recovery was exhausting.
And I lived like in a nightmare.
But...
When I got up on my own feet again,
I felt that the whole world belonged to me.
I'm so grateful to Dominic-san.
I'll pay him back even if my whole life goes to this.
Even though he never agreed to accept money from me.
So why are you stealing?
If you're really grateful to him, stop stealing!
What?
Dominic-san gave you these legs from the bottom of his heart!
And you have to answer him the same!
If you really decided to spend your whole life to pay him back,
earn the money honestly,
put them on the legs he gave you.
I'm sure Dominic-san will be happy then.
I see.
You're right.
Yes, I won't steal anymore.
I'll pay him back with the money earned honestly.
Oh, yes.
I have to pay him back.
Am I right?
What?
I think I broke them.
They don't open.
Let me see.
No, he sealed them with alchemy.
But why?
The answer is obvious.
There's something hidden there that he's ashamed to show to others.
Done.
Let's see what's in here.
Oh, it's a secret.
Do you remember?
October 3, 2011.
What does it mean?
Please, give it to Hedo.
Winry?
I...
I'll ask Dominic-san again!
Take me to the school!
What's going on?
What happened?
Pony?
What pony?
Help!
Sadilo-san said he's giving birth already!
Fullmetal Alchemist!
Available for free for viewing.

We can't take her to the hospital in this weather.
I'll go to the city and bring the doctor.
Dad will be back soon with the doctor.
Just a little more patience, okay?
How can I be patient
if the child is trying to get out?
What's wrong with you?
What is she saying?
I can't understand.
The child is about to give birth!
Give birth?
What are we going to do?
There's not a single doctor here!
What are we going to do?
What are we going to do?
What are we going to do now?
We'll do it!
We'll do what?
We'll accept the child.
What?
Have you ever accepted a child?
I haven't, but...
We don't have time to waste.
We have to do everything
to make the child be able to give birth.
Ethel, you boil the water.
Yes, ma'am.
Panini, collect all the towels you can find.
Yes, ma'am.
Riddle-san, do you have a little alcohol?
I think there's a little in the warehouse.
Oh, and please,
prepare drinking water for Riddle-san.
Tell me, do you think she can handle it?
She was born into a family of doctors.
Since childhood, she's been reading medicine books.
Really?
What?
So she doesn't even have a special education?
And I think she doesn't remember much anymore.
Then how?
But now...
We have to trust her knowledge and courage.
So, boiling water, disinfection.
What else?
Remember.
Remember.
Winry!
Can you do it?
Yes.
Panini, help me.
Yes.
Brother!
Brother!
I'm always helpless in critical moments.
I'm going to die now.
It hurts so much.
I can't take it anymore.
Of course I don't believe in God, but...
Yeah.
If you exist, I beg you.
Brother!
Blood.
I can't take it anymore.
What happened?
She did it!
Hooray!
Great!
The baby is really born!
Great, great, great!
You did it!
Great, great!
Just like a little one.
Just think about it.
It's the birth of a new life.
For centuries alchemists have been trying to create it.
And an ordinary person can give a new life.
I can't compare alchemy with a secret birth.
I can't.
I'm an alchemist.
But it's still amazing.
People are amazing.
It's amazing.
Now that the baby is born,
can I help you with something?
Of course.
First of all,
help me get up.
What?
It's so amazing to ride on a guy who's not as tall as me.
Shut up, or I'll drop you.
Ed.
Huh?
I saw that you cut the clock on the lid.
What?
How the hell did you open it?
I'm sorry.
You fool.
Wait.
I didn't even show it to Alla.
But why?
It's a reminder and a symbol of my decision.
Let it be for girls,
but the memory of that day helps me move forward.
Why are you crying?
It's dangerous.
Now we have no way back.
Yeah.
What are you crying about?
I'm crying because of you.
You never cry.
You fool.
I think it's time for you to go home.
Grandma must be missing you there.
No, I'm not going.
What?
When did I see that?
I saw it.
What?
When I saw it,
I realized that I can't go home now.
You fool.
You don't have to take such a knife on yourself.
Me too.
I'll get stronger
and I'll do the best I can for you.
Then you can calmly continue your search.
And that's why I'm going to ask Dominika San again.
Winry!
I see.
Good luck.
Winry!
Riddle San wants to see you.
What's going on here?
No, it's okay.
I'll be right back.
Paniniya!
It hurts!
Shut up!
Give us back the watch!
You didn't have to hit me with your right hand!
Do you want me to hit you with my left hand?
This is your grandpa.
He's so cute.
He's changed so much.
And the mother and the child feel great.
And they cut the popovina neatly.
Even adults panic when they first have to take the baby.
Well, I was a little scared too.
I'm very grateful to all of you.
Especially to you, young lady.
Thank you.
Why are you so formal?
God, you're embarrassing me.
Well, it's just right to take her as a student.
It's a completely different matter.
I don't take students.
But if you insist, I'll introduce you to one craftsman who lives at the foot of the mountain.
Excuse me.
Can I come to you sometimes to watch your work?
Of course, you can come visit my grandson.
And you, Paniniya.
Oh, no, faster!
If we don't have time for the next train to Dublis, we'll have to wait another three days.
Take care of yourself.
You too.
And don't forget to call grandma.
It's not for you to talk about it.
Try to get all of his knowledge out of this old man.
And when we meet next time, you'll give me a better car armor.
Here you go.
Put it on me.

In the city of Dublis, where their sensei lives, the boys remember the times of their education.
This is their first step on the way to the truth.
Next time, in a solid metal alchemist.
Episode 12.
One is everything and everything is one.
She didn't dare to say it because she wanted to protect them.
