I don't think I'll be able to meet her as soon as I can.
Hi.
Oh, hi, Ikari.
You remind me of my little sister.
Welcome.
Thank you.
How is that possible?
She can't be in the hospital forever.
It looks like you rarely go to the hospital.
No, I don't go to the hospital.
I don't go to the hospital.
I don't go to the hospital.
I don't go to the hospital.
Her parents have already given up on her.
And the head of the Shihekosai Kai, her blood relative, has been in a coma for a long time.
So she has nowhere to go.
The teacher must have already told you.
The prechudere works thanks to the horn.
Yes, they say it has become smaller, so everything is fine.
The horn has started to grow slowly again.
So she's here so that nothing happens again?
That's right.
That is why we will look after her, not the orphanage.
She will live in the teacher's dormitory.
We will get to know her better and help her learn to live healthy.
In addition, we need to check something.
But everything has its time.
It looks like you have a lot of work to do as a teacher.
For this I am.
I will have to leave school for a while.
Besides, we are friends.
I'm sure you'll have a lot of work to do.
But don't forget to come to her.
Of course.
If the body and spirit come back to normal,
then the resurrection of the immortal will not have to wait long.
Yes, I hope so.
I'm sorry, third year, I have to ask.
Can you take care of her?
I can.
Let's play Matelo.
Can we come with you?
Great, come back to the dormitory.
You will soon have guests.
Let's go.
Let's go.
THE END
Are you sick?
Is everything okay?
No, everything is fine.
This is a sign that my tears are working.
What are you talking about?
Someone probably just remembered about you.
You have a bunch of fans.
What a rose after the festival.
I will be very grateful if you don't laugh at this.
There are probably a lot of fans about Kayami a long time ago.
You work with Yastribe.
I don't think so.
Everything happens there very quickly.
Here they are, guys.
Say hello.
Look at these twinkling glances.
We came to give you a hand.
They appeared as if from nowhere.
Very cute and very cat-like.
Wild, wild cats.
Wild cats.
Long time no see.
You kittens look good.
I'm sorry, I couldn't protect you then.
Forget it, it's in the past.
We're all right, aren't we?
Cat paws, cat paws!
Please come in.
We won't be long.
We need to visit Class B.
We haven't seen the cat for a long time.
Thank you for the letter, I will keep it forever.
You're welcome.
Look, Midoriya.
He chose them himself.
He said he wanted the red ones.
That's not how it was.
We really look alike.
By the way, why are you in U.A.?
We came to tell you that we're back in business.
Really?
Congratulations.
Rekdol, are you going to work too?
I thought your magic was stolen,
so you can't do it anymore.
I don't have it.
I'm going to work in the office,
helping the other three.
Office lady cat.
By the way, we got a message from Tartar.
I'm very sorry that it happened.
I can't stop myself when I see a good miracle.
It's a habit, what can I do?
I would gladly return it.
But for this I need to use my own magic.
If you're okay with it,
I can do it right now.
It's still not clear to the end
how many secrets he's hiding.
That's why it's best to stop him from doing anything.
It's the best way to hold him back.
Then why did you decide to come back?
There was no official message yet,
but in the top of the Japanese heroes,
we were in 411th place in the second half of the year.
The top of the Japanese heroes!
He's based on the number of investigated cases,
the level of help to society,
the level of support to people,
and he's counted twice a year.
In other words, the higher the place,
the more useful and kind the hero is.
Last time you were in 32nd place.
Got it.
It's all because your rating dropped.
Good luck to you.
Not at all.
We're still among the best,
even though we didn't do anything.
It's all thanks to the support of people.
It helped us a lot.
People are waiting for our return.
That's why we can't stay out of it.
Here's the thing.
You're so cool, wild cats!
Shut up.
By the way, the results of the second half
are still not announced.
A lot of things have happened.
The top of the heroes without the almighty?
I can't wait to find out
who of the heroes is on the list of the best.
This is the first top after Kamen Incident,
after which the symbol of the world, the almighty,
was forced to resign.
Everyone understands how important this event is.
Before, the heroes never went on stage
during the announcement of the results.
But now everything is different.
Let's get started.
Number 10.
Last time she was in 9th place.
The hero of the world,
Ryukyu.
To be honest, I didn't deserve it.
Number 9.
He also went down below.
But he's definitely not going to lose.
The hero in armor,
the hero of the world,
outside the best three,
our places are determined only by the passage of time.
Number 8.
Directly from the advertising of purity and shine.
The hero of the washing machine,
the cleaner.
The cleaner.
The cleaner.
The cleaner.
The cleaner.
The cleaner.
The cleaner.
Number 7.
Truly a giant leap up.
A promising hero whose growth cannot be stopped.
Wooden Kamui.
Wooden Kamui in the seventh.
I am very happy for him.
Still, we are from the same team.
If you believe in rumors,
you are welcome.
No comments.
Oh, damn it, I hate it.
Why did he get into the top ten?
You also have a pretty high place.
Number 6.
The hero of the famous school of courage,
which holds its place.
The hero of the Korra shield.
I want to see you fight again,
almighty.
Number 5.
The rabbit,
whose determination helps him to rise higher.
The hero of the rabbit,
Miruko.
I heard you formed a team.
Number 4.
The mysterious ninja,
who appeared in the top ten
thanks to the open affairs and support of people.
The ninja hero,
the sharp shooter.
Be quiet.
Be quiet.
There are a lot of people around.
This time the heroes,
who were in the center of the incidents of Kamino,
were located much higher.
That is why the next one is him.
Even taking into account that he took a break,
he is still number three.
This time he is supported by the most people.
The hero of the threads,
Bad Jeans.
We are looking forward to when he will return.
Number 2.
The sly one,
who does everything in his own way.
He quickly reached the second place.
The winged hero,
the hawk.
You are confusing me.
And then,
the one who was the temporary number one hero.
Today he will become the true number one hero.
He has been waiting for this for so long.
The fiery hero, the hard worker.
We have chosen such an option.
After all, we have seen that this is what society lacks.
Almost three months have passed since the resignation of the Almighty.
There are still rumors that we have lost the icon.
But right now,
here are the heroes who will fight for us.
Let's build a peaceful society together with them.
Well, what is it like to be number one hero?
And now we ask each of you to say a few words.
Thank you very much.
If I had the opportunity,
I would refuse all this.
There are those who I did not save,
although I should have.
I will try to become a hero,
worthy of my place.
Ryukyu.
I understand you, Ryukyu.
I see sadness in your heart.
Regret.
But we must be strong.
You can do it, Ryukyu, you can do it.
Koro, it's your turn.
Too worried.
This is good.
Our actions now have no meaning.
Clean, Alchik.
I want to work so that there is no shame for those who come before me.
I am talking first of all about the sharp shooter,
who took me to his team.
Damn it!
And why didn't I go to Kamino that day?
Hey, you bastards,
preparing all sorts of misdeeds.
Get ready for the fact that I will knock you out.
You were the third in the support level of people.
I'm not interested in numbers.
I'm glad for all the support you got.
However, I do my job not for fame.
I believe that our work can bring peace.
Who will be pleased with such speeches, huh?
Petno.
I like you, you are so bold.
You, as always, would only swing the boat.
I just can't control myself.
So...
It seems that everyone wants to talk about human support.
Bat-Jeans is number one in this regard.
Not bad, he got up during the break.
Next, me.
Then the sharp shooter.
And the fourth, the hard worker.
I'll skip the rest.
It seems to me that this is the most important indicator at the moment.
And the truth is, if you think about it, who needs the past?
Don't you think it's time to change something in our world?
There are no more symbols.
At this critical moment,
why do those who don't have so much experience
try to sit back somewhere?
Say something like a hero.
It seemed to me.
Or did he get dizzy at first?
It's hard to understand what's on his mind.
Yastrip, 22 years old.
Half a year ago, he got into the top three heroes.
He opened his agency at 18.
And already in the second half of the same year, he got into the top ten.
He became the first in history who got into the top ten at such a young age.
The fastest and the youngest.
Someone says he's too fast.
I don't know if he always does everything his way or...
You're so arrogant.
That's all.
Your turn, number one.
Which is supported by fewer people than me.
Many people understood what Yastrip was talking about.
It will be difficult for the hard worker to oppose something.
Former hero number one.
What does it mean to be a symbol of the world?
Danto.
After such a fiery speech of this young man,
I have nothing to add.
So just watch me.
I don't know if it was some kind of boring nonsense.
I thought I had to cheer people up somehow.
Did you torture me?
No, what are you talking about?
In fact, I helped you.
It turned out well.
I'm not a fan of the Almighty at all.
And I never wanted to be like him.
But even for me, his resignation was a shock.
I'm not saying you need to be an icon like him.
But I think we definitely need a leader.
Now I'm calm.
After all, you are so cool.
Does he really think so?
Or is he mocking me?
And you never wanted to be this leader?
Do I look like the one who would want it?
I would have a lower place and more freedom.
I would be glad to be twenty or thirty.
I hate people like you.
The conversation is over.
Go apologize to others.
Well, I actually wanted to chat more.
I don't want to listen. Go away.
I would like to unite with you.
There were several strange messages in my hometown.
Do you remember NOMU?
The previous ones understood everything.
But I have big plans for you.
High end.
Kyusyo Street.
I will destroy it.
I worked in this company for three years.
I will destroy it.
As far as I remember,
I always tried to be attentive to the feelings of others.
It was very exhausting.
But today I say goodbye to this version of myself.
I used to scream so often,
damn company,
release me, release me.
Yes, hello, release of metal people.
Hazukashi Teruo.
Thirty-one years.
With a miracle of shame.
The more shame he experiences,
the stronger he becomes.
Metal man.
Freedom.
Why?
Worker.
What kind of food do you like?
Here they make great baked food.
There you can clearly taste the taste of chicken.
It's not too heavy food.
Are you hungry at all?
Schwartz, no!
Eikitori, by the way, is also nothing.
Barbeque from the oven in Yoritomiya.
Also the highest class.
Oh, it's Jastri.
Usually he doesn't walk like that.
Hello.
Grandma, let me help you.
Thank you, honey.
Jastri, congratulations on the second place.
I watched yesterday's top.
But if you behave like that, you will have a lot of enemies.
Enemies?
Jastri, Jastri.
Sorry, my son is your fan.
Can I have an autograph?
Wow, what a cool bag.
And I can definitely write on it.
Of course.
What's your name?
Ryosuke.
That's right, Ryosuke.
Thank you for your support.
Thank you, Jastri.
Thank you very much.
He's a hard worker.
He has a scary face.
What kind of wild aura does he have?
Go get an autograph.
For nothing.
You said you liked him.
Yes, but it's not that simple.
Oh no, he's coming right here.
What?
It can't be.
Damn, what a cool suit he has.
Don't hold back.
Something's wrong.
What's wrong?
The hard worker never communicates with fans.
His character makes him so cool.
And you like that?
No, you've changed.
You've changed.
Did I do something wrong?
And with that guy Ishiketsu, everything worked out for me.
That was a natural reaction.
It doesn't look like you at all.
Oh, you're not going to do it anymore?
Can I take it?
Eat as much as you want.
I'm not going to eat that.
I can't control myself.
When it comes to what I want.
By the way, after the festival, I tried to recruit your son.
It would be cool to have a son-hero number two assistant.
But fortunately, I met Tsukiyomi.
After all, I failed the exam for a temporary license.
What did everyone remember?
For those who have never studied in the U.A.
You know too much.
I have good sources.
Stop it already.
I've gone all this way.
I don't want to hear such a conversation.
Let's get down to business.
Are you talking about the rumors?
Updated Nomu.
Grotesque dolls.
Created by the League of Villains.
Those several dozen that were stored in the stone
were captured together with everyone for one.
After that, the league was occupied, so there were no new Nomu.
Or was it all their stock?
Or did the old one know where the others were stored for one?
You bastard.
Your request to unite said that you had at least some evidence.
No, I don't have them.
This is really just rumors.
Bring the check.
I'm going home.
Come on, wait a minute.
Just listen.
This is not the only place where Nomu was seen.
You didn't know?
They were reported all over the country.
There were not so many of them to write a whole article about it.
But the host sitting at home is whispering about everything.
And there are also schoolchildren who notice a lot on their way home from school.
What are you leaning towards?
It was the first time I heard such rumors on a business trip.
Then I worked with the police, conducted a secret investigation
so as not to sow unnecessary panic, but I didn't find anything.
That's why it became even more interesting for me.
So I flew all over the country, conducting my own investigation.
Investigations?
There were some differences.
But in general, the rumors spread in completely different places.
In the end, it was just rumors.
Then there will be not very accurate information.
But after Yuei, Hatsu and Kamina,
everyone knows how terrible these redone villains are.
So it seems to me that some idiot decided to come up with a scary story.
Take it and spread it all over the country.
That villain was screaming today.
Yes, hello, liberation of the meta-humans.
Right?
The same words were in the reissued biography of one villain.
By the way, it sold well.
Apparently, he was very impressed with this book.
Such books are sold much better when society has a hard time.
Don't go away from the topic.
Just say what you want.
Closer to the topic.
I want you to become the leader you can rely on, since you are the number one hero.
I want you to confirm the truthfulness of these rumors.
And then proudly say that there is nothing to worry about.
I will not do anything special.
Yesterday I said the same thing, but now ...
I want to be the one who will promote the number one hero.
Bastard.
I don't want to complicate anything, really.
Just sometimes go on patrol.
I'm sorry that nothing happened and go to sleep.
You can't come up with a better life.
I want to create a world where the heroes will have a lot of free time.
You're a hard worker.
Your drinks.
Back!
Who is the strongest here?
Yostrip, get people out of here.
Got it. What about you?
Rumors?
Looks like I have a happy day.
Well, that's exactly why I came.
Flamethrower!
Flamethrower!
Attack.
I'll show you who I am.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
