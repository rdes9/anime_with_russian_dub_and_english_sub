        <pre>I brought you clothes.
Thank you.
It seems to be cold next week.
I'm glad.
I like the cold.
Yeah, we all don't like the heat.
Natsu, you look good.
Since he entered college, he doesn't come home.
He says he meets with girls.
But I'm always in touch with my sister.
By the way, mom, you also look good.
The color of your face, you have a beautiful face color.
Did something good happen?
Shota wrote me a bunch of letters.
He writes that training to get a temporary license is very difficult, but he tries his best to catch up with his friends.
Yes, he often writes to you.
And because of work in the dormitory and additional training, he doesn't have so much time.
Don't you think it would be good to have a phone with him?
It's hard to write letters.
You're right.
I wonder what the doctors will say.
Can I read?
Just don't say anything.
Mom.
Yesterday he officially became number one.
Natsu.
No one knows what he did to you and our relatives.
No one knows that he betrayed his family.
He doesn't attend talk shows, doesn't give interviews.
Let's not talk about father.
Everything is fine in Fuyumi.
I don't remember him very well.
For me, he's a stranger.
So I don't care what's going on with him.
But I can't let him behave like that.
As if he didn't do anything to you.
It's been almost 10 years.
He hasn't apologized, has he?
He wants to forget about the past and his relatives.
That's not true.
Why are you defending him, mom?
These flowers.
I told him that I liked them.
I don't know.
Why are you defending him, mom?
Why are you defending him, mom?
These flowers.
I told him that I liked them.
I told him that I liked them.
When we first met, it was only once.
Did your father come to you?
Yes, and apparently many times.
But I didn't see him.
I'm still afraid.
And the doctors say that meeting him will be a bad idea.
I don't know what's going on in his soul.
Maybe he has a reason to come here.
But he's definitely not trying to forget the past.
On the contrary, he doesn't want to forget his family and what happened.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry .
He's sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm I'm not sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm not sorry.
I thought you were going to kill me with your fire.
Regeneration.
One of those who was Haseo is exactly the same.
This is the power that I did not see in the Whites.
It turns out that the Blacks are special.
If so, then this one stands out even among them.
Because...
He can speak.
Isn't that right?
Well, if so...
I'll grab him alive to break the information.
Fiery fist!
Hell's spider!
He's just burned out.
Hey, come on!
Number one!
I'm going to kill you!
Number one!
He held out my blow.
He surpasses me in speed and strength.
Are you kidding me?
It's falling!
Look for them.
Unbreakable feathers.
Screams of breathing.
Pieces of clothing.
Vibration of human bodies.
I can't save everyone in the building.
There are not enough feathers.
We need to limit ourselves to people in a dangerous zone.
Yastrip!
They are unbreakable feathers.
They are quite tough, but flexible.
He can control each of them.
76 people are killed in the zone.
They were successfully evacuated.
Fiery fist!
Hell's spider!
Is this your best blow?
Of course not.
I'll tear him to pieces and burn him to the ground.
Machu Picchu
Yastrip!
You never practiced pre-work?
Your pieces are a little rough.
You need to grind them more.
You'd better keep quiet, or I'll take the force to move.
You know what?
After the loss of a large number of feathers, it becomes a little difficult to fly.
I'm sorry, bird.
We'll help you, Yastrip!
You're getting in the way!
Did he split up?
No, he didn't.
Were they inside him?
I'm starting to overheat.
Who's the strongest here?
If you take his words seriously, he'll only be a strong opponent.
Very evil.
That's why in order to keep fighting me, he sent his men to detain my support.
This Nomor, he thinks.
Get out!
Yastrip!
Okay, wait till I figure it out.
To be honest, I'm pretty weak against strong enemies.
My help won't be enough to support you.
You...
...don't fight anymore?
Me?
These...
...missiles?
You won't do it?
More fire?
So...
...you're a bit of a guess.
The flame fist is a concentration of a very hot flame, which I use for a single charge strike.
If you use it often, the temperature of my body rises, which weakens the body itself.
However, not only am I slower and weaker than him, but I also have a much stronger body.
Therefore, not using my strikes would be a mistake.
And my body continues to heat up.
Therefore, for your sake...
...for your sake...
...and for...
...your sake...
Take it off!
You're a woman!
Take it off!
Do you see that?
You're a hard worker!
It's too bright even at such a distance!
It emits too much fire!
Let me...
...try my newly acquired power on you!
Burn yourself in the purifier, where you won't escape and won't regenerate.
And then you'll fall!
Full of fumes!
Just...
...watch me.
It's not the time to...
...be weak!
Bad news.
Worker!
He tore off his head and threw it away!
Worker!
He tore off his head and threw it away!
Worker!
Worker!
It's boring.
You're the strongest hero.
I'll become the hero you can be proud of.
Proud that your father is the number one hero.
The strongest of people.
The city is suddenly destroyed by the villains.
There's no confirmation yet.
But it seems that there are modified people down there.
Nomo.
Currently, the heroes are fighting with them, evacuating people in parallel.
However...
The worker, the first to enter the battle, is wounded.
And this...
...reminds me of what happened three months ago in Kamino.
Kamino no Akamu!
Too slow.
More. More power.
Worker!
Worker!
Worker!
Worker!
Worker!
Worker!
Worker!
Worker!
What is he doing?
If you can't win, wait for reinforcements.
You know better than anyone that you don't look like the Almighty at all.
That's why you lost so quickly and now you're angry.
You didn't think about your children.
You offended your mother until she got sick.
Surrender and run!
Natsu.
There are things...
...that you don't know about, but you can't accept.
He never surrenders.
There's no one more stubborn than him.
Everything's fine!
Calm down!
Please don't run like that!
Everything's fine!
Please, drive me.
Please, drive me.
Don't push!
Faster!
There are people.
Calm down.
Mom!
There's no symbol anymore.
And this is how we live without a symbol.
It can't be.
People are panicking.
It's a bad thing.
Tadoroki, have you seen it?
Mom, look at this.
Teacher, don't say the first thing that comes to mind.
You're only thinking about getting on TV.
Enough!
You don't have to think about it now.
Look there.
The flame is still burning.
Do you see?
Do you see this?
The worker is still alive and fighting.
Stop talking nonsense.
You're making people panic.
You took everything too close to your heart.
Enough!
Let's hurry up and hide.
Look at the man who risks his life for your sake.
Look at him!
You can also regenerate.
Don't compare me to myself.
I couldn't move for a long time.
Now I can only see the flame.
And I am grateful to him.
Pain helps me stay conscious.
It will help me stand up.
You just have to think about victory.
You need more warmth.
More!
Even more!
Hey, you're not human enough.
It will be bad if your head gets hurt.
Stop clinging to life.
Overcome yourself.
Overcome his speed.
I will become better and will not fall.
Until I turn this bastard into ash.
That's right, worker.
You're not human enough.
You're not human enough.
I don't have enough feathers to beat him.
But I can't beat him in speed.
I know.
I was watching you.
There was not a single person who tried to surpass him.
Only you.
Only you were the one who wanted to be better than him.
Tell me honestly.
How stupid did you feel?
I use a few torn feathers earlier.
To help you catch up with him.
Overcome his speed.
Let me push you a little.
Number one.
I want to become stronger than anyone.
My strength is not enough to cover you.
However...
He suddenly began to behave like an animal.
Come on.
Even considering the fact that he burns from the inside,
does he have time to regenerate?
This flame turned out to be insufficient.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
This flame turned out to be insufficient.
My feathers.
I used almost everything I had.
The remaining ones will burn and disappear.
I'm sharp.
Inhuman.
Nobu.
The one who created you is capable of using several spells.
Let's win by force.
Go!
He's fighting.
He's suffering, but he still keeps fighting.
He's fighting!
He's risking his life for you.
Look!
Old man.
I watch!
I'm looking at you!
All my feathers are burning!
I can't help it anymore!
That's enough!
Higher and higher!
Even higher, where I won't think about people and buildings!
I see.
You want to climb as high as possible to fully use your strength.
I see a person.
You.
It's me.
I'm from the past.
Or from another future.
Burn and rest forever!
I've always hated this school motto.
Plus Ultra!
Full...
...of...
...burning!
The end
The striker is standing!
He's standing!
Standing...
...with his fist raised!
This is a symbol of his victory!
No!
It's his beginning!
Even if the All-Powerful has resigned,
the heroes must move on.
And the ones who will continue this path...
...will be us.
To be continued...
To be continued...
To be continued...
To be continued...
To be continued...
To be continued...
So you're...
...the Ninth.
To be continued...
To be continued...
To be continued...
To be continued...
To be continued...
