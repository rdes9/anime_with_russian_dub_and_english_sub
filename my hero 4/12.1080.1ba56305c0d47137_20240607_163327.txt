You tried so hard to become a hero, didn't you?
Or you tried so hard to save Eri, Rumerion.
You're sick, like everyone else.
I'm going to cure people like you.
With the help of Eri's power.
Night Eye...
Tamaki...
Guys...
Shisaki!
I told you to get rid of that name!
I said, get rid of that name!
THE END
This damn labyrinth is over.
I don't know where to go now.
As far as I understand, Eri's room is there.
Eranaka, quickly return everything as it was!
Hurry!
And...
The drugs are over.
As far as I know, he can control objects no more than the fridge.
But if he strengthens himself, it's quite possible, isn't it?
I guess the fatso was right.
Eranaka can no longer show something like this.
What's more important, Toga and Twice.
From the League of Villains somewhere nearby.
Toga!
Toga!
Twice!
I won't forgive them!
They're traitors!
Where are the other representatives of the League?
Who knows?
But I'll find them all!
I'll just break through their fucking skulls!
So it's just the two of them here.
I don't think they're going to attack us.
Even though they've given their vows, it doesn't mean they've become our allies.
The League of Villains is the most wanted group.
We can't just ignore them.
Our biggest problem is the presence of the League of Villains.
If we meet them on the way, you'll have to leave.
Coach!
What the fuck are you doing?
Rock-Lock!
Just keep going!
Leave the League to the police!
Have you forgotten your main task?
He's right.
It's the right decision.
Someone's going to have to keep an eye on Eranaka.
Thanks to the yellow girl, I'm going to do it.
It's a little tough.
So take your hands and go ahead!
Ryukyu's team is going outside.
The police and those we left behind are busy inside the building.
Sun Eater, Red Buntar, Fat Swat, Rumerion!
We've come so far not to doubt you!
Don't waste your time and get to work!
Go!
I'll save her and come back!
Rock-Lock!
I said those words not to insult them.
My wife is four years younger than me.
Last year, we had a son.
It's all in you. I have nothing at all.
I don't care that they're not from UAE.
Children are children.
How can you not worry about them?
But when it came to business, what did I see?
Each of them is better than any adult hero.
You'll save her and come back?
I catch you on the word, Deku.
And you too, Night Eye.
It's better not to forget about your debt.
They're gone, finally.
So, what are we going to do when we get out?
Toga, maybe we'll kiss?
I want to see Izuku completely beaten up.
But you know what I want more of?
I want to see how the Restorer of the Sea of Compassion.
By the way, about that...
No idea.
You don't want to listen?
What do you have there?
Mkonyom, mkonyom.
Jin, it's...
Make Tomura happy.
Even if Izuku finds the Restorer,
it doesn't matter.
We don't care who the winner is or who the loser is.
I can only hope that both sides will be beaten up.
I will.
I'll save her!
I'll wipe them out.
Night Eye, protect the wounded!
Two of the Chisaki allies are killed.
We found one on the way.
The Chisaki himself barely held on.
He was protected by the changed wall.
Mirio, Eri...
Follow me.
Now everything will be fine.
You're incredible.
Incredible work, Mirio.
I can't use my magic.
Rubirion has cornered them.
Let's finish them off.
Yes, sir!
Get up, Chrono!
Deco!
Everything that touched my arrow is slowing down.
I wanted to catch both of them at once,
but you are well prepared.
He needed time to wake up.
At that moment, Chrono was killed.
But I healed him instantly.
I can't stop the Night Eye!
Chisaki!
That's it.
That's it.
That's all useless!
I won't let you destroy my plans.
That's right, Nemoto.
That's what you wanted, didn't you?
You will give everything
so that I don't end my journey here.
Nemoto, you did a great job.
You want to die for me, don't you?
I'm sure of one thing.
Rubirion, you were stronger than me.
But all your efforts were in vain.
Now...
Give me Eriya back!

I know everything about you.
RubbingÈùÅ, hero, wipe your head out.
Your magic was an ideological basis to study Eriya's magic.
Probably you'll wonder why I isolated you, not killed you.
It's simple...
You'll come in handy more to us alive.
Miracles, erasing miracles, are very attractive to him.
Oh, there's no point in twitching.
You're gonna be a little faster than a snail, no matter how hard you try.
After all, I struck you with my clock.
Right hand of the leaders of the death vows, Kuro no Harie, miracle of chronostasis.
Stretch your hands in the shape of an arrow to attack the enemy.
Everyone who touches the arrow slows down.
If he's made up his mind, then he can't be stopped.
I don't know if you're aware of this, but Eri is the real daughter of the leader.
He takes advantage of anything for the sake of his goal.
So what's the point of a restorer?
He destroyed himself and his comrade and got together in one piece.
What a terrible feeling, but it's better than what I felt before.
We need to assess the situation.
Eri Togatou is defending the Night Eye.
I don't see the teacher Aizawa.
Where's the guy in the white hood?
Chisaki merged with his ally in one piece.
His wounds have healed.
Touching other people is like dirt.
My blood is just boiling with rage.
It's the first time I've been so angry.
It's sad, isn't it, Rumerion?
You shouldn't have connected with me, Eri.
Then you wouldn't have lost your miracle forever.
His miracle?
Lost?
You got involved in a pointless struggle.
You could have followed your dream.
I can't believe it.
He used a miracle on his ally?
Senpai!
Senpai!
Senpai!
Senpai!
Senpai!
I can't read his movements,
but if it weren't for my iron boots,
I would have been pierced through.
Strength and speed.
Is that all?
I'll take him on myself.
Well, try it.
Limit his movements and get closer.
You can't let him touch the environment.
Take care of Rumerion Eri.
I got it.
Where are you going?
Where's your assistant?
I'm interested in heroes who wipe out the enemy.
I sent them to the room for dear guests.
His goal is to wipe out other people's miracles.
But isn't he afraid that his miracles will be wiped out?
So one of your purses that wipe out miracles forever
was used to stop Rumerion?
I thought you were running away like a rat
to hide them.
But are you so scared of Rumerion?
Listen, Mirio.
Keep an eye on your opponent
and predict his movements.
You want me to see the future,
but my miracle is not a prediction.
Very funny answer.
Your prediction will appear
along with your experience.
Salvation, battle, survival.
It will all become your database.
I got it, sir.
Mirio.
You took all my lessons.
You believed in me
and became stronger.
I'm so proud of you.
I want to see
you safe
and everyone you want to protect.
Did you see?
Didn't I ask you
not to use my prediction?
Why don't you try
to see the details in the distant future?
The future that I see
cannot be changed.
I tried and it didn't work.
I can only correct what happened
in the future I saw.
In the end, everything happened
as I saw it.
The future never changed.
I use my prediction.
Don't I dictate the future
to a person?
If I didn't use my prediction
on the Almighty,
I wouldn't have died in the future.
His death.
I...
You're thinking too much.
It's a fact.
But I won't do it anymore.
I'll use my prediction
to see the distant future.
Just a few seconds ahead,
I'll see his future
and save the boys and Eri.
Take good care of them.
Eri.
Senpai.
Are you okay?
Can you move?
Yes.
I'm okay.
Yes.
Everything ended badly.
Yes.
Let's get out of here.
This is the way we came.
We need to get away from Chisaki.
Enough.
Already.
Every one of your unnecessary actions
kills people.
You're a cursed child.
Forgive me.
Sir?
Sir!
I'm sorry.
The future.
Where Eri and Mirio will be saved.
The future!
He wasn't so strong before.
So now he's fighting seriously.
Senpai, take care of Eri.
My body is burning.
But I can move.
My body won't last that long.
But I'll continue.
One for all.
20%.
Give up.
Everything will end as I said.
Everyone will die.
It won't happen.
Even if it's fated.
I'll change it.
Don't be afraid of me.
I see the beginning of his miracle.
But I don't have time to react.
Hold on.
Until you win.
Chisaki definitely won't give up.
He'll do everything to get Eri back.
I can't slow down.
If I hurt him, he'll recover.
With one hit.
You have to do everything with one hit.
Manchester...
CRUSHER!
He's back?
It doesn't matter how fast you are.
Compared to these two,
your movement is too predictable.
We have to take Eri to a safe place.
Everything is fine.
I still have the strength.
I didn't even get close to my limit.
Move!
Go, Rumerion!
Get up!
Get up!
Move!
Eri...
Hide.
And wait.
Eri...
People...
want...
to save you.
Eri...
You'll be fine.
Eri...
To be honest,
restoring parts of the body is very painful.
If the Earth hadn't split into small pieces,
it would have pierced me with a big thorn.
Tie it up.
Not yet.
Not yet.
Ah...
Rumerion was also brave in front of me.
You can't underestimate those who don't want to give up.
Because of you,
more people will die.
Did you want this?
Eri!
She won't be able to do it anymore.
It will be dangerous to continue.
I see.
Then we just need to restart her.
Return her strength back.
I...
I...
I didn't want...
all of this.
Don't!
Go back to Mirio, Eri!
Eri...
Do you think this boy will be able to get out of here alive?
He won't be able to.
Then what are you supposed to do?
Return, Eri!
And in return...
You will return everything as it was!
That's right!
Why should everyone around suffer because of you?
Only you will suffer alone.
At some point,
it was possible to believe in Rumerion's victory.
But did you understand?
All your actions complicated Eri's life even more.
She doesn't need you.
Midoriya...
You...
You won't be able to save Eri.
You won't be able to save Eri.
I saw the future where you will die.
And Chisaki will run away.
Even if that's the case,
why did you decide
that it wasn't my business?
You were crying, remember?
No one will die here.
And I will save you!
Eri!
Eri!
Eri!
Eri!
Eri!
Eri!
Eri!
Eri!
Eri!
Eri!
Eri!
Eri!
Eri!
Eri!
Eri!
Eri!

Eri!
Eri!
Eri!
Eri!
Eri!
Eri!
Eri!
Eri!
Eri!
Eri!
Eri!
Eri!
Eri!
Even if the Night Eye saw my death.
Forward! One for all!
The power that gives me the courage to call for help.
I will use it!
In the next episode, the infinite 100%!
Overcome your limit, Midori Izuku!
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
