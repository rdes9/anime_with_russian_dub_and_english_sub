We will show you that our generation will be better than yours!
That's what I wanted to see! Attack the snot already!
Well, how do you like my sorry balls? I couldn't dodge, right?
Too fast and strong to see, right?
War dust! These guys don't know what we're doing.
Come on, do them!
Dust!
Cosmos Lavina!
Electromagnetic bullets!
Royal blow!
Obruch!
Tongue gun!

Hey, what's going on?
When I was their age, I didn't have that kind of power.
Physically, legally, or mentally?
I've heard of something like that.
With the change of generations,
miracles change and deepen.
Then, strong, more complicated miracles
can become too difficult one day.
I don't think so.
I don't think so.
This theory of singularity is a miracle.
Looking at these children,
you start to be a little afraid that it is so.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, it's all mine.
Hold on, teacher.
Well, now it's their turn.
We'll see everything now.
Kassadka, is everything bad or what?
Bad.
Bad.
Kassadka, is everything bad or what?
Bad.
What do you think?
Do you want to say
that I just stand and watch the whole situation?
No, of course not.
Even if they fail,
they want to be heroes.
I don't care,
something is so insignificant.
They attack people without thinking.
They are completely crazy.
It seems they think that they can do
everything they want against those who
strive to be heroes.
I just want to be friends with these children,
even if I have to forget about the training.
It can't be.
They were not afraid of our miracles,
although they were born a little earlier than us.
Guys, let's show them all our strength.
I'm starting.
This is the Balev ray.
Hey.
Hey.
Show me your cute face.
Don't spoil it with wrinkles.
Okay.
Sorry, this is just an illusion.
Isn't that what you want to hear?
Our school is so old-fashioned
that it doesn't allow us to meet.
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?

I can cover up the adults in everything.
I can cover up the adults in everything.
I can even play the piano better.
I can even play the piano better.
The heroes that get into trouble every day,
they are shown on TV,
the police,
our ever-crying teacher.
They are all hopeless compared to me.
We will show you
that we can use our strength
much better than you guys.
Your pranks are really surprising.
You know,
it's not enough to just use your strength.
I'm starting.
Yeah.
I was right in the building.
Easy peasy.
Cool!
Cool.
Cool!
Cool.
You can even play this!
You can even play this!
Cool!
This is so fun.
This is so cool!
Cool!
You can even do things like this.
What? What? What?
That's great!
I can't create complex figures.
That's why I used the Iwami made as a basis.
I'm glad you have good magic.
It's not fair!
Only they do that! I want it too!
Okay, then get in line.
Wow, that's cool!
That's what they should think thanks to us.
But if you lose to an opponent you look down on,
you just feel like shit.
In this case, these kids...
Just like me, they will create problems for others
during the preliminary exam.
I don't want them to follow my path!
Yes, we have to find something
that will expand the scope of these kids.
The plan to avoid the attack
and strengthen the connection between them
without destroying their spirit.
That's a great way to use magic.
It's a kind of relief.
Hey, what are you doing?
Hey, what are you doing?
Can you let me go?
I'm sick of these rules.
You're their leader, aren't you?
If you keep looking at everyone from above,
you won't notice your weaknesses.
Just a little advice from the leader.
Remember that.
Hey, bald guy! Get out of the way!
Bald guy?
What he just said...
What for?
Why?
I can't say these are empty words.
They came from his heart.
Of course.
They affected me.
And now let's all try together
and do something more amazing.
Let's make the waves
like on roller coasters.
Yeah!
Is that even possible?
These disobedient kids...
What is it?
And then it's your turn, teacher.
Please, guide them with your mind.
Yes.
What do you need to be strong for?
A hard worker.
I'm sure the answer
is very simple.
To work together
and capture the hearts of these kids.
You did a great job
with such unclear tasks.
So it was clear to you
that they were unclear?
The others did a good job too.
Remember everything you learned today
and apply it in the future.
You all have a lot of potential.
I mean, damn kids!
Sir! Yes, sir!
He really loves kids.
He just makes himself behave like that.
After all this,
I really like you now.
Our fates are also good together.
I see.
And still, Bakugo,
you're actually not bad when you're silent.
Try to be silent all the time.
Shut up yourself!
Huh?
We'll do everything we can.
Hey, what's going on, Shishikura?
Are you talking to the Almighty?
It's so symbolic.
How cool. What are you talking about?
About life and other things.
We're talking about you, dumbass!
Seriously? Cool.
The reality is that the league was aimed
not at UA, but at another school.
We still didn't have much interaction
with UA.
That's why we were talking about
and exchanging additional information.
We still don't know
why you became the target,
Tsushima.
We hope that the joint work will clarify everything.
Cool.
Besides, joint training is being considered.
Next time I'll pour you one on one.
You're still behaving like a bastard!
Know your place!
I don't want to hear that from you.
What?
We haven't seen each other for a long time.
You've changed so much.
Shut up.
What?
I'm proud of you, son.
That's why I'll become
a hero you could be proud of too.
Proud that your father
is hero number one.
The most powerful man.
Do whatever you want.
Staratel!
I support you in everything!
Thank you.
You're bleeding, by the way.
Let it be a little,
but Staratel
and other boys and girls
sometimes go to the dead end.
Sometimes they look back.
But step by step
they move forward.
It was made especially for Gym Club.

We didn't have time to take a look
at how September ended
and October began.
There were no traces of summer days
and more and more
temperature changes were felt.
Later, the students at the internship
together with the all-powerful
and teacher Maezawa
attended the funeral of the Night Eye.
After the discussion between the school
and the Heroic agencies,
it was decided to stop
the students' internship.
The Night Eye agency
headed by his assistant,
Sorokanozhik,
was waiting for
the return of Togata.
Eriza
finally came to her senses,
although she was emotionally unstable.
Her premonition
could have gone out of control,
so it was forbidden to visit her.
But
the rock on Eri's forehead,
from which her premonition came out,
decreased after the temperature
and now
it's the size of a bump.
It's not the easiest task,
but you have to figure out
this integral.
If you know the answer, raise your hand.
The electric plasma teacher
sometimes goes overboard with tasks.
Great start!
Even Yaoi Rose,
the best student in the class,
has no limits on this task.
Midoriya!
107.14!
Wrong!
Yaoi Rose!
107.28!
Correct!
Let's move on to the next page.
You were close!
You made a mistake with the math!
Deku,
are you really trying to get into this?
You're putting all your effort into studying.
Now, to make it in time,
let's go have lunch.
Yes, I'm hungry.
Then a little cheese.
From that very day
strange things
began to happen to me.
You scared me!
Cheese?
Sir Paul Evac.
Known for his lightness and softness.
Actually, I still have some in my mouth.
Thank you.
Aoyama, let's go to the canteen.
You usually eat alone, right?
No!
Food in the canteen doesn't suit me.
Well, they don't argue about the taste.
You don't want it, you don't need it.
Okay, see you later.
Strange things.
His words and actions always have an impact.
But it's hard to say what he thinks.
This is all Aoyama.
Until he
shows his true nature.
What was that just now?
It was Aoyama, right?
What?
Why is he on the balcony?
What is he doing?
Why?
Oh, it's scary!
What should I do?
His room is nearby.
Why is he walking on the balcony?
I don't understand.
What should I do?
His room is nearby.
Why is he walking on the balcony?
Maybe I should take a look?
No, it's too strange.
Even for me.
It's so scary that he
actually thought about it.
I know.
Cheese!
No!
Next day.
Don't run!
But run as fast as you can!
Go, go, go!
One minute left!
Did you make it?
You shouldn't go to bed so late.
It can break the nervous system.
I'm sorry, sir.
Surprise!
Aoyama!
I was so scared that I couldn't sleep.
I never really
talked to Aoyama.
He didn't really try to
maintain the relationship with the others either.
He's free-spirited,
so he says what he wants and when he wants.
That's his image.
I wonder what's going on with him.
Whatever it is,
you can't tell everyone
and make hasty conclusions.
Hey, Mineta!
Have you seen this?
What's the rating?
For all ages!
The mountain lady and the arrow mark are united!
The wooden stone is also with them!
The mountain lady, you say?
The hidden team, right?
People have been talking about them for a long time.
Recently, many heroes have joined the team,
right?
The progress of the lady is amazing.
When we become professionals,
let's also create teams.
Uraraka can make me float in the air,
and I'll make acid rain.
Isn't that cruel?
Sarah can also control me with her ribbon.
What are you talking about?
Koda, Shoji and Jiro can be scouts,
and our team will be called Rainy Day!
What about us?
We don't need you!
In the team, look not only at the wonder,
the compatibility of characters is also important.
I'm Momo.
It's just sadder.
Guys, hurry up,
otherwise you won't have time to change.
Today we will work on improving
your super techniques.
If you have not achieved two techniques,
work on it.
If you already have two super techniques,
continue to improve them.
Rappa,
I will become a person
who does not tremble when seeing
someone like you.
I will train, taking endless blows.
And for this ...
Bakugo, Sato, Midori!
Please beat me with all your might!
People will not understand us like that!
Sorry, I have individual training.
Okay,
have you made much progress?
Not quite.
Not quite?
I thought you wanted to beat me too!
Kirishima,
let's go for the gaubits!
Sounds cool!
No! The building can explode!
One for all.
Being at the limit, I can release
20% of my strength, but even in this case
I could not overcome Chisaki.
I must learn to use
100% on my own,
otherwise I will not be able to beat
or save anyone.
Hey!
Look!
This is my new super technique!
Pulse laser strike!
And even more!
As always, I perform the technique
and my stomach starts to hurt.
Then why did you do it now?
Teacher Cementos, Aoyama
How does he feel? Can he have a little rest?
Of course.
We are together.
If you ask, then right now.
This is
recently on the balcony.
I know the words.
What are they about?
Your miracle is incompatible with your body.
You are just like me.
What are you talking about, Aoyama?
Aoyama-kun!
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?
I always had to
wear this belt of support.
Since childhood.
If you don't wear it,
the laser bulb will break out.
I was born like that.
My miracle is also incompatible
with my body.
That's what the doctor said.
When you just started in UA,
you didn't control
your miracle either, right?
It always seemed to me
that we were alike.
Since the beginning of school,
you are more impatient
than before.
Aoyama,
surprises should make you happy,
right?
Surprises make me the happiest.
That's why I did what I
hoped to make you happy.
Is the cheese delicious?
I didn't have the courage to eat it.
If you encounter so many difficulties,
then you won't be able to shine.
I was surprised.
But it was all to cheer me up.
Thank you.
Your surprise was a success, Aoyama.
Aoyama?
It worked.
Since then...
Here's the money.
Thank you.
Aoyama, you've had so much fun lately.
Aoyama and I became friends.
Thank you, Aoyama.
