I was transferred to a new school in the spring with a transfer to the third grade.
I... I couldn't say a word.
Immediately after that, everyone in the class got to know each other and had fun,
getting together in a new group.
I didn't have the courage to talk to anyone.
And even before that, I never had any friends.
It always seemed to me that I was boring and inconspicuous.
Ah, Majiki!
You wanted to say that you wanted to become a hero, didn't you?
Your head means I want to become a hero!
Ah, well...
I like heroes too!
And then...
Majiki, which hero do you like?
You talked to me.
You shone so brightly.
Like the sun.
I wonder if I can shine like you.
I want to become a hero!
I want to become a hero!
I want to become a hero!
I want to become a hero!
I want to become a hero!
I want to become a hero!
I want to become a hero!
I want to become a hero!
I want to become a hero!
I want to become a hero!
I want to become a hero!
I want to become a hero!
I want to become a hero!
I want to become a hero!
I want to become a hero!
I want to become a hero!
I want to become a hero!
I want to become a hero!
I want to become a hero!
I want to become a hero!
I want to become a hero!
I want to become a hero!
I want to become a hero!
I want to become a hero!
I want to become a hero!
I want to become a hero!
I want to become a hero!
I want to become a hero!
8 Covenants of Death!
We have an order to search!
You are accused of illegal drug distribution!
Who are you?
What do you want, bastards?
I said we have an order to search!
Please calm down, free us the way!
If you continue to resist, then you will regret it!
Did you get them to win time?
Bro, stop it!
Leave them to us and move forward!
We will cover you!
We are in a hurry!
We are very in a hurry!
We are very in a hurry!
There is no doubt about their suspicious behavior.
I have a bad feeling, friend.
But we have nothing to do but move forward!
I'm ready to argue with them.
Someone leaked the information.
They act as if they were ready for this.
If so, why don't they act smart?
Seems they just follow the order for this case.
When you join the gang, you swear to be loyal to your boss.
And the allies become like brothers.
It seems that nothing has changed since those old days.
So much noise.
And we haven't seen any clock or other large cones.
I'm afraid of the treasure. They are now preparing to escape.
What kind of loyalty is this?
I force my subordinates to defecate while they themselves are running away,
pulling their tails.
Yeah.
Come here.
This is a device that opens the passage.
If you do everything right, it will open.
It's like in the house of a ninja.
The ghost allowed us to avoid problems.
Take care of the people we don't know who they belong to.
Who are you?
Bubble Girl, I'm leaving one for you.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Himeko, that little jerk, he's begging you
to leave his brother alone for no reason.
I beg you!
Damn it.
My eyes!
I'm sorry.
We'll catch them and send for the police.
I'll check the wall.
Rumerion, your clothes will fall off.
Everything will be fine.
Mirio's costume is made of his own hair.
This allows his clothes to stay on him.
I knew it.
This path continues, as Sir Noctis said.
This is just a wall.
But it's very thick.
Most likely, it's Chisaki's work.
Only he knows how to disassemble it.
It's just a wall.
But it's very thick.
Most likely, it's Chisaki's work.
Only he knows how to disassemble it.
It's just a wall.
He doesn't want us to see what's behind it.
Right.
Let him try to stop us again.
One for all.
Full coverage.
Side-style.
Red glove.
You're not bad, guys.
You reacted even faster than we did.
We continue the path.
We continue the path.
You wanna fight?
I'll go, you go.
I'll go, you go.
What?
What's going on?
Everything's moving.
It's not Chisaki.
It's somebody else.
Most likely,
Irohnaki's miracle, Mimicria,
which allows him to enter the objects and change their shape.
He merged with a concrete wall that forms the dungeons
and changes it however he wants.
But this is a huge area.
As far as I've heard, he can do it with objects no more than a refrigerator.
There's nothing impossible for their drugs.
I knew his miracle and waited for him to use a small object.
But to use a whole dungeon?
I can't imagine what awaits his body after that.
Look out! Look out!
You can block him!
No, I can't see his body yet.
If it continues like this...
We won't be able to do anything about it and we won't have time to run away.
We need to find a solution to the problem.
But I can't.
Everything is useless.
We're not the ones who won't save the girl.
We'll do it ourselves.
Tamaki!
This won't work.
You're the Sun Eater!
This shit won't stop us.
I'll do it while I know the way.
Let them change the direction of the wall.
I'll go.
Rumerion!
Senpai!
We don't have much time.
They're just trying to stop us and run away.
I'll go forward.
Don't.
What am I doing?
Mirio will do everything he can.
Then...
I know what to do.
He's going through the wall.
But...
Even if he gets there, he won't be able to do it alone.
A room?
We're going further and further away from our goal.
It's annoying.
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
The representatives of the government themselves have come down from the sky.
They're some kind of miracles.
It looks like they're in the mood to fight.
Now I'll show them what a pro is capable of.
Leave your strength to the pro for more important things.
It's not like that at all.
I'm putting myself out there because you're Tamaki here.
Tamaki!
For those who are trying to win time...
Enough of me alone!
It's specially voiced for Gym Club.
Send the group to vk.com.
They fell through!
What to do?
I have no idea.
There are more people here than I expected.
But first, let's get rid of this.
I'll leave them to you with eight bullets.
For those who are trying to win time...
Enough of me alone!
What are you doing?
Come on, let's beat them together.
Yeah, attack together.
So I can kill you together.
This is Setsuno.
Don't use guns against him.
We're counting on the heroes.
So you know.
Well, okay.
So I can't hold back.
We won't let you.
Drop the katana.
It doesn't work?
He erased the spell.
It looks like Prichu Duere.
I've heard about such a hero.
But I didn't even think that we would have to fight him.
But that's it.
Swords or bullets are not scary to my body.
Surrender!
Then why are you whining, fat man?
Thanks to the three heads, we can use guns.
Surrender!
Thieves.
Setsuno Toya.
Crystalization.
Hoji Yuya.
Absorption.
Tabe Suromitsu.
I've seen your data.
I'll take them on myself.
I ate a bunch of takoyaki in the office.
So my knife skills are at the peak.
Since I was shot, I've been more attentive to such things.
But Senpai...
Nothing good will come out if we all fight them.
That's what they're after.
They want to keep Profi here.
Prichu Duere and the three heads must move on.
And you'll need more strength to move on.
Officers and guns.
Fat Man!
I can handle them!
Forward!
Fat...
Get out!
Hey, wait, wait!
Again?
I've been using magic on them.
Take care of them while they're helpless.
Guys!
Take care of Mirio.
I know he's trying too hard.
Help him.
Fat Man!
Why did you leave him alone?
What were you thinking?
He's your employee, and I didn't shoot.
But he's got a lot of problems.
He's the strongest of all of us.
But he's got a weak heart.
He's always screwing himself up.
And with such stress, he got into a big U.A.
And at some point he says he can handle it himself.
How can I refuse him?
They told this guy to get rid of everyone he meets.
There's no Irenaki's body here.
And his magic too.
So he's been working for the police?
Whatever happens, I'll stop them.
I still can't use magic.
I feel like a fool.
Like he said.
We need to kill them while the three-headed magic still works.
Three at a time.
I'm sorry, but I'm going to kill you.
You got scared and jumped off.
You shouldn't take this battle lightly.
Because you're fighting against real rejections.
You never know what we're hiding under the mask.
The three-headed magic doesn't work anymore.
I'm going to kill you.
I'm so glad you can't be killed.
I'm so lucky.
Thief.
Everything that's on a man can be on him.
So my shell can be stolen too.
We all gave up our lives.
The hero saved me when I jumped off the roof.
I can say I'm lucky.
I've been dead for a long time.
And we're all the same.
He picked us up from the dumpster and gave us a new meaning of life.
Even rejections have an honor.
If hopes are put on us,
then we must justify them.
What's the matter, Magic?
You should be able to do more magic.
Are you still nervous?
Don't worry too much.
Get back to work.
Magic can be used in different ways.
Not only by heroes.
But in how to use our magic in the future.
And that was our teaching.
What are you doing, Ogata?
Your face is stuck.
I'm telling you, it's not easy.
Do you want to try?
It's five times harder than you think.
Ogata, you're not very good at controlling your magic.
Next time it will definitely work.
Mirio, you're amazing.
What?
Even if something doesn't work, you're always positive looking forward.
Because of this, everything around you becomes lighter.
I'm not good at anything.
If something doesn't work for me,
I immediately fall into a trap.
You will become a great hero.
A hero like the sun.
What are you talking about?
You're praising me so much, but I don't deserve it.
I only report when you're around, Tamaki.
My will is not as strong as you think.
You just can't avoid it even when you're very nervous.
And I don't want to lose to you.
Lose?
You overestimate me and underestimate yourself.
That's why you call me the sun.
But I know you're incredibly strong.
And I also know that you're a very funny and funny guy.
I'm exploring your words.
It turns out you're much cooler than the sun.
I...
Be more confident, Tamaki.
You're...
I...
You're...
I...
The one who even ate the sun.
I'm the sun eater!
He connected the octopus muscles to hold the blow.
And several layers of shells helped him deal with the crystals.
But you're doomed!
All this time...
I've been practicing my magic tirelessly.
I'll try to put together everything I can.
Size changes.
Simultaneous activation.
Choosing the right attributes.
Multiple hybrids.
Chimera...
Kraken!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
One was enough for me.
What the hell?
Hey, wake up!
We have time!
Octopus...
With his teeth, he can eat anything.
His stomach can digest anything eaten in a second.
Tamaki never gets tired of eating.
You're a great match for each other.
Look, the head understands how scary his magic is against me and knocked him out.
But it's okay.
I can move.
I can surpass his movements.
Yum!
Perfect.
You still have my defense.
But...
You won't be able to stop my strike.
You still want to fight against the three of them at the same time, Sun Eaters?
I thought you'd knock us out right away.
I thought your huge tentacles would be enough.
I'm going to show you a neurotoxin in my hand.
You'll eat me and you won't be able to move.
He was too big to eat him before.
But with this size, there's no problem.
They work together.
Let's get rid of them, but we have a strong connection with each other.
They're going to arrest you anyway.
Will you beat me or not? You have no future.
So what?
We've had no future for a long time.
One of us didn't accept society and threw it out on the street.
The other one was betrayed by a lover.
Why did he have to pay debts?
One food.
Apparently, it can turn into a food property.
The third one was used as a toy to grow crystals.
But then it turned out that crystals are of no value.
He was considered useless and beaten to death.
But then he said to us,
Join us.
You're not one of those who should die in a place like this.
We don't care what happens next.
For a man who gave value to our lives,
we will kill anyone.
They follow him not out of fear.
They've just been brainwashed.
Do you really want to be a waste of material?
The heroes don't understand us.
You're cornered.
Take it.
My attacks will be eaten.
My defense will be stolen.
Let's get rid of them, but we have a strong connection with each other.
Then...
I'll interrupt their combination, which starts with him.
The thief is working on what he sees.
That's why the police didn't get the guns.
Die!
Crystal?
It can't be.
My crystal!
Did he eat it?
That's right!
Eat!
Die!
You're doing a great job as a team.
I don't understand your hatred and sadness,
but I know the essence of your connection.
You don't use each other.
That's right.
You can't eat your friend.
You can't eat your friend.
You can't eat your friend.
You can't eat your friend.
You can't eat your friend.
You can't eat your friend.
You can't eat your friend.
You can't eat your friend.
You can't eat your friend.
You can't eat your friend.
You can't eat your friend.
You can't eat your friend.
You can't eat your friend.
You can't eat your friend.
You can't eat your friend.
You can't eat your friend.
You can't eat your friend.
You can't eat your friend.
You can't eat your friend.
You can't eat your friend.
You can't eat your friend.
You can't eat your friend.
You can't eat your friend.
You can't eat your friend.
You can't eat your friend.
You can't eat your friend.
You can't eat your friend.
You can't eat your friend.
