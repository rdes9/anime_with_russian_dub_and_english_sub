        <pre>Finally, we did it.
Yes.
This is not the drug that stops in a couple of days.
We started with the preservation of the effect of antibodies,
which are extracted from the area.
Now we can completely erase the mystery.
However, it will take a lot of time and money.
It takes a month to create 5 bullets.
All because of outdated equipment.
In the best conditions of production.
The almighty is gone, and this is our chance.
There is no time to do nonsense.
We are waiting for you.
We are waiting for you.
We are waiting for you.
We are waiting for you.
We are waiting for you.
We are waiting for you.
We are waiting for you.
We are waiting for you.
We are waiting for you.
We are waiting for you.
We are waiting for you.
We are waiting for you.
We are waiting for you.
We are waiting for you.
We are waiting for you.
We are waiting for you.
We are waiting for you.
We are waiting for you.
We are waiting for you.
We are waiting for you.
We are waiting for you.
We are waiting for you.
We are waiting for you.
We are waiting for you.
We are waiting for you.
We are waiting for you.
Please, don't disappear.
I decided to protect that day.
I have a promise in my heart.
Even if it's a cold light, go!
I had to come to the top of the order.
We haven't seen each other for a long time, you freak.
I won't forgive you for anything.
I'll be glad to work with you.
Well done.
Great, let's fight.
I'll get wet.
I'm sorry for Magna.
I didn't want to kill him.
Eyo!
Be more respectful, please.
Well, I can understand your dissatisfaction, but now we work together.
I want you to help us with the implementation of the plan.
Bastard.
And understand what he built from himself and at our first meeting.
You screwed up!
Well, what should we do?
Just follow the order like everyone else.
First, tell me about your secrets.
At the time of need, I want to give you a suitable job.
What?
I'll tell you about our time of need.
I don't like you all yet.
I'll just post everything.
Don't underestimate Yakuza, you freaks.
Oh, no.
No, that won't do.
You can't do that.
Bad feeling.
I won't say anything.
And about the premonition?
Well, the premonition works on my imagination.
I need height for the human being.
Shoulder, chest, legs, and a lot of data.
I'll take a close look and think.
Only then I can double it.
Here are only short-lived copies.
They are destroyed if too much damage is obtained.
And at the same time, I can double only two things.
And the second one will have more wear.
And for personal reasons, I do not double myself.
What? Something's wrong!
This is not me!
I look stupid.
No, Toga, this is...
What about you?
I can turn into a person whose blood I drank.
The amount of blood depends on the time
during which I can stay in another person's appearance.
One glass is enough for about a day.
If I drink blood from a bunch of people,
I can turn into each of them.
The corresponding clothes also appear on me.
But because of the fact that I am a person,
I have to take off my clothes first,
which is a little embarrassing.
Here.
Tell me something else.
Have you heard from Shigaraki
about the traitor?
No!
Oh, well.
Now you are a member of the Eight Councils.
But you can't pretend to be a member of the Eight Councils.
You are a member of the Eight Councils.
You are a member of the Eight Councils.
But you can't act freely
with criminals.
Don't leave the basement without an order.
Don't leave the basement without an order.
What the hell?
I want freedom.
As soon as you get a little trust,
you will get more freedom.
You will get more freedom.
So you can't behave like that.
If you understand,
listen to me.
We are Yakuza.
We need to be counted on.
We will take control over the society again.
The revival of Yakuza.
The wish of the boss will come true.
The wish of the boss will come true.
And you will contribute to this.
Be grateful, you freaks.
I will not forgive those
who mock us.
I will crush everyone to death.
The weak boys are the most ferocious.
The weak boys are the most ferocious.
When they get angry,
they become stupid.
We don't have the strength.
So we'll leave it to you,
hero.
Hello?
Did you hear?
Something big moved with a strange scream.
Is that the voice of Iranaki?
Where from?
I don't understand.
The devil will crush us now.
The weak boys always want to hide their weaknesses.
They want to show their strength,
so they look at people from above and below.
Bandits, you say?
One for all.
Full coverage.
Strike.
Miracle.
Don't be angry, Kudza.
After all, we will do what we want.
Bye-bye.
And the hostages?
Freaks.
Catch him.
They betrayed them?
Apparently, they used us.
But the labyrinth ends here.
Eri.
Togata.
I'm sorry.
But we can still talk a little.
You couldn't have appeared here so quickly.
I found a shortcut.
I came to save her.
As I understand it, you started playing as a hero, schoolboy.
That's right, we're new, that's why we're worried.
Then you decided to pretend that everything was fine.
She doesn't want you to save her.
You're not a hero for her.
That's why I'm here.
What about the wall?
I'll tell you so you understand.
You're going to die.
What?
A sense of balance.
It's a bit of a hassle, isn't it?
You barely stand on your feet.
Me too, that's why I don't walk on the floor.
Don't come near me.
Is this his wonder?
Eri is so close.
I don't have time to deal with such...
What about your wonder?
Penetration. I can go through anything.
Why did I say that?
I thought where you came from.
I see.
That's how you bypassed the facial expressions of others.
Who did I bypass?
Are you drunk or something?
You're the drunk one.
Me?
Shut up and help me especially.
One of the Eight Invincible.
Nemo Toshin.
A miracle of confession.
He can get answers from any person.
Sometimes he can make someone who didn't even realize tell the truth.
Another of the Eight Invincible.
Sakaki Daidora.
A miracle of drunkenness.
It makes people around lose their balance.
I see.
A miracle made you talk, then.
But you're not for fighting, are you?
I'm different from all the other pawns.
I'm exceptional for the Eight Commandments.
I was worthy of getting closer to the ambitions of the young boss.
Use your own daughter.
What other ambitions?
I see.
So that everything goes smoothly, you don't need emotions.
I think you should understand that.
When you first met Eri, you let him go, didn't you?
Yes.
And then you figured out what our plan was, and you regretted it.
Save Eri?
You just wanted it to be easier for you, didn't you?
His body doesn't listen anymore, sir.
There's only the soul left.
The soul is like a brain.
Just a little shake and she'll die.
I live for the boss.
And the boss needs me.
I have to follow.
And we'll share the happiness when everything happens.
Finally!
Die, you piece of shit!
Deathly Reception!
Ghostly Threat!
That's right.
I'm weak.
I did something unforgivable.
I showed her cruelty and indifference.
We brought her back to hell so that she wouldn't suffer on her own.
I chose to go back to hell.
Such a good girl.
That's why I came here.
And that's why I'm here.
It's impossible. How can he move at all?
I constantly feel something worse than an accusation.
But you found out the truth about yourself.
I won't doubt it.
As long as she lives without a smile, I won't accept it.
Power!
Chisaki!
Why?
You can't come here.
He'll kill you.
I won't let you suffer anymore.
It's okay.
I'll be your hero!
It's dirty.
Come to me, Eri.
I'll kill you?
How many times do I have to tell you?
You're breaking people.
That's how you were born.
No, you can't.
Don't listen to him.
I'm always telling you.
Because of your egoism, I have to get my hands dirty.
All your actions kill people.
You're a cursed creature.
How can you say that to your own child?
Oh, right.
Something like that happened.
I have no children.
Chisaki's miracle. Reconstruction.
The power that allows you to destroy and restore.
It's not just a restoration.
How fast?
Just a little more and that's it.
But he...
He could have hit her.
Oh, it doesn't matter if it breaks.
I'll just restore it right away.
I can even restore it from the puddle.
She doesn't know about it.
What are you going to do if Eri gets hurt?
Besides me, there's no one to cure her now.
You have no way out anymore.
You can't run away with the help of a miracle with Eri in your hands.
Are you going to fight me, schoolboy?
I thought I knocked him out.
Didn't you have enough strength?
I don't know.
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.
He's a fool.
He aimed at Eri's hand.
I didn't think he could use his magic exactly like that.
He's been training a lot.
Destroying the spikes to be able to aim freely.
If you decide to shoot, there will be no more spikes.
I'm sorry, okay.
I didn't see his face.
But based on behavior, most likely he was the first helper, Chrono.
He was very bad.
He's probably the first one to help, Chrono.
He was on the list.
You can't get under his spell.
He hid himself to beat me?
I thought the armor was only for beauty.
Chrono!
I'm sorry, Restorer!
He's strong, but he left Eri.
If he breaks it, he'll stop resisting.
You're one of those people, aren't you?
You are!
The hero tears off the armor to cover the scared, wounded, or suffering girl.
I'm going to wrap your girl up!
Keep an eye on the enemy.
Predict his actions.
I'll do it!
Chisaki.
By his abilities, you can't say that he's just a Yakuza.
You're strong.
That's all.
But...
I'm even stronger!
I won't let you suffer anymore.
I'm going to be your hero!
You can't touch her with your finger anymore!
I'll put you both here!
You lost, Chisaki!
Chisaki...
I've...
abandoned you.
Boy, if you have nowhere to go, come to me.
What's your name?
Do you speak?
Chisaki...
Chisaki Kai.
The gang's broken up.
They're just tying our hands together.
It'll come to us anyway.
It's just a matter of time.
We need changes.
What about the plan I recently proposed?
You're not going to come to your senses?
As soon as you turn from the path of man, the end of Chisaki will come.
No one will follow a heartless demon.
Boss!
What?
He's conscious too?
Nemoto!
Shoot!
Join me.
I'll be calmer with you.
That was true.
I need the boss.
I'll give up my life just to be close.
Where?
He's under a spell.
Only one shot.
How can I catch him without a spell?
While she lives without a smile, I will not accept that!
That's how it is.
That's what you've been through all this time.
You'll have to accept despair.
There's no salvation.
She doesn't know about this.
You won't suffer anymore.
You won't suffer anymore.
You won't suffer anymore.
You won't suffer anymore.
You won't suffer anymore.
You won't suffer anymore.
You won't suffer anymore.
I'll be a hero and I'll save people.
I agree.
With our magic, you'll make one mistake in half.
It's very difficult to learn.
That's why Dad didn't become a hero.
And you still want to be Mirio?
I'll try.
Then Dad will cheer for you.
Try, Mirio.
Try.
Try.
The patients were given a miracle so that they could dream.
Do you really think you can become someone?
And it's all in your head.
It's just nonsense.
The power you wanted to save her.
What did you work so hard for?
It's all in vain.
I'm still Rumerion.
I don't believe it.
Sakaki's miracle still has to work.
He lost the miracle that made him invincible.
He needs to keep an eye on Eri.
What?
I can't believe it.
I can't believe it.
I can't believe it.
I can't believe it.
What?
What's wrong with him?
I'll try.
I will become a hero.
And I will save.
And I will save.
And I will save.

Did you really want to be a hero?
I wanted to save Eriar, Rumerion.
This is all the dirt of our time.
I will cure those like you.
With the help of the power of Eriar!
Night-Eye!
Tamaki!
Guys!
Chisaki!
I've already given up this name!
This is a preview.
Togata is protecting Eriar to the end.
No matter how he was wounded,
even if the prelude was erased.
Now it's my turn.
But Chisaki is in rage
because Eriar was taken.
He won the prelude and begins a counterattack.
In the next episode
Unpredictable Hope
Night-Eye said he can't see the future.
The future is me and Eriar.
Go beyond!
Plus Ultra!
