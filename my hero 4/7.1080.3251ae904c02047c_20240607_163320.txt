On the day of the debut of the Red Boundary, one of the new substances was hit in Tamaki.
The substance that erases the miracle.
After analyzing the substance from the bullet, we learned that the basis for them was human blood.
In other words, it turned out to be a human.
His miracle.
The miracle that destroys other miracles.
The miracle of the Chisaki boss is called reconstruction.
It is able to destroy and collect any substance again.
Of course, it can do this with the human body.
Chisaki has a daughter named Eri.
But there are no records of her.
And when Mirio and Midoriya met her, her whole body was wrapped in bandages.
In general, this bastard Chisaki makes bullets from the body of his own daughter and sells them.
If these two had saved the girl, we would have avoided it.
These two are already so upset with what happened.
Next time we will protect Eri.
And save her.
That's right. This is our goal.
To be continued...
To be continued...
To be continued...
After revealing such a shocking truth, several days have passed.
Meanwhile, the rest of the professionals, under the leadership of the Night Eye,
searched the areas of activity of the Eight Deaths in search of Chisaki and Eri.
And we kept waiting.
We were forbidden to talk about it.
Especially to other students.
Wow, the interns are working hard.
They must have done something.
Hey, come on, tell me what you came up with.
I'm sorry, I can't.
Kirishima, Uraraka and Asui are also involved in the Eri rescue operation.
In general, listen, if you don't count the big three,
then you are at the level of a professional.
The rest will have an insignificant role.
Asui, Uraraka, Kirishima.
You three are involved in this not at your own will.
What do you think?
Teacher, look at the head.
After everything heard, I have no one to talk to.
If you do not intend to talk to us, then we would like to help her.
They allowed them to be present at the meeting.
This means that they recognize the abilities of the first years.
And they are much better than I was in their time.
And the magicians will stop promising themselves.
If I can help at least something, I will help.
Look at the head.
I understand you.
Our goal is to save Eri's child.
And nothing more.
The night police.
They found out that the eight secrets of death and the League of Villains are not in very good terms.
Apparently, they will not be in the same place.
However, if you meet the representatives of the League of Villains,
leave there.
Yes, sir.
We were very inspired by the idea of saving Eri.
But something worried me.
If you continue like this, you will meet a villain who will kill you in a terrible way.
Now is not the best time to ask the night eye.
And I could not discuss it with my friends.
I can not talk to the Almighty either.
How can we solve the rest?
About Eri and the Almighty.
It all pressed on me.
Do not go.
I had to concentrate on saving Eri.
But at that moment my mind and heart were already at the limit.
Do not you want to eat?
Yes, I want to eat, of course.
Are you okay?
You are completely disheveled since you started working in the office.
Really?
If you want to talk about something, do not be silent.
We are friends.
If you want to talk about something, do not be silent.
We are friends.
You told me that when I behaved like a fool.
Before practice.
Hey, Midoriya!
I'm sorry, I'm okay.
Everything is fine.
I can not talk about it.
But...
Thank you, Ida.
Sadness, regret.
When the feelings overfilled my heart and began to come out.
The heroes do not cry.
No.
The heroes also cry, it seems.
Probably.
Do you want me to give you something special?
And I'll share it with wine.
Thank you.
Do you want onions?
Bon appetit.
And wasabi?
Yes.
On the same day.
Not far from the eight death tips shelter.
We will split into groups and examine the death tips shelter.
To find their real shelter.
And reduce the search radius to a minimum.
I would like you to examine each of them.
Then we can move on.
Move on, huh?
When you explore all the places.
I want you to pay attention to the following things.
The first.
Places where bullets could be made destroying miracles.
The second.
Do people often come in and out?
The third.
Are drugs being sold on this territory?
Eight death tips have developed a detailed plan.
And they follow it without much noise.
Act with maximum caution.
Sukauchi, what did the police find out?
I see.
Well, continue the investigation.
Half the place is just empty.
We need to carefully search the rest.
Hurry up.
Please, hurry up.
Find it.
Where is Eri?
Two days later, late at night.
A day later.
Did everyone get a message?
Yeah.
Got it.
The time has come.
I didn't expect them to get away with it so quickly.
Mirio.
Let's get them.
There is.
Now we're going to do it.
We're going to save you.
We're going to do it.
We're going to save you.
We're going to do it.
It was made specifically for Gym Club.
The site of the VK group is vk.com slash gymfans.
The weather is going to be sunny today.
It's a good day for sunny baths.
However, in the evening...
Takayami in Kusyo.
He's working.
He's working.
Yes, everyone who works can't reach it.
Midoriya behaves strangely.
Don't you think so?
Especially this morning.
Yes.
He was looking at his fish very seriously.
Yes, not only Midoriya.
Kirishima, Uraraka, Itsuyu.
They also looked puzzled.
Do you think they work on something serious?
After all, they work with professionals.
And that's true.
I don't think you should worry about them.
What?
Eren is in their fortress?
So they have a house?
The mansion of the head of the Eight Councils of Death.
Did we conduct an investigation for nothing?
No, we got a lot of new information.
How did you find out about this?
A member of the Eight Councils of Death bought this toy in the store.
This toy is only suitable for little girls.
What?
What is it?
Maybe he just likes such things.
There are a lot of crazy night owls in the world.
And why did you buy it yourself?
No.
He confirmed everything with his talkative tongue.
Do you have that famous toy?
It's so popular among little girls.
Oh, you mean the little ones?
Oh, that's right.
As I remember now, it's a great team of little girls.
Where are these toys?
I'm sorry, these toys are no longer for sale.
Now another series of these toys are on sale.
Damn it.
Okay, what else is there?
I found one.
What do you need?
I'm a fan, too.
Great little girls.
I'll be waiting for a call.
Okay.
You used the foresight?
As I said, I use it to be sure.
So we're ready to act?
And we know exactly when they'll all be there.
We've got an order from the police.
Everything that's left...
It's going to break in there.
He stole my phrase.
Deco.
Midoriya.
Come on, let's do this.
Why are you moving so much?
Let's do this, let's do this, let's do this.
Senpai is back to normal.
Hey, look.
Let's do this.
Let's do this, let's do this, let's do this, let's do this.
Let's do this.
Mirio.
You also regretted what happened back then.
You were able to hold yourself back then.
So that we could prepare.
Disappointments and regrets are part of our lives.
But what's important is what we're going to do next.
Will we be able to change the future?
I don't know.
But we'll be able to buy the past.
We'll be able to look back with a calm heart.
Mirio.
Shine.
You're the one who can do this.
This time for sure.
For sure.
Well, let's get to work.
At the same time.
The mansion of the head of the eight death commandments.
Chief of staff.
Yes, the heroes gathered this morning.
The police also began to fuss.
Boss, it looks like they found out about this place.
Found out?
Act according to the plan.
Okay.
Get ready.
Yes!
Boss, where are you going?
I'll take care of something.
Before the building of the police station.
Night Eye used a foresight on one of the death commandments.
And we found unregistered underground structures.
Under the building of their base.
We were able to confirm that the girl we were going to save is in this building.
We couldn't open their underground planning.
But the path that the man walked from the foresight.
The best way to our goal.
Please follow him.
They will use their own tricks for protection.
And it will make it difficult to search.
We have compiled a list of those who are known to us.
Their tricks and features.
Please study them.
It's nice that they prepared this for us.
We must not let them have time to hide.
We need to divide by positions and act as quickly as possible.
We'll finish it as soon as possible.
You are too active this morning.
I'm nervous.
All these investigations and work with the police.
I didn't do this before.
Yes, it's strange.
That's right.
We didn't do this in the academy.
I had to study during work.
All the professionals are so calm.
Are they used to it?
By the way, Gran Torino didn't come in the morning.
What happened to him?
I think he's busy with something else.
What?
Tsukauchi found out something about the League of Villains and called him.
But we already have enough people.
There will be no problems.
That's right.
Maybe we can detain the League of Villains and eight death commandments at the same time?
That's right.
Great.
Hey.
Wipe your head.
I'm in the night group.
Wipe your eyes.
You understand why, don't you?
I'm watching you.
If you're going to do it, do it right, Midoriya.
Yes.
Heroes!
The enemy will show a cruel resistance.
If you see even a hint of resistance and innocence,
deal with it as hard as possible.
Tamaki, eat this.
This is a fish sword.
Why do I need it?
In any case, thank you.
Your opponent is Yakuza, who managed to survive to this day.
Don't relax for a second.
Do your tasks.
Operation starts at 8.30.
We're moving out.
I'm sorry, father.
It's going to be very noisy now.
Assault.
As soon as I finish reading the order, attack.
Please act quickly.
He says as if he doesn't trust us.
He's the one who told me to do it.
He's the one who told me to do it.
He says as if he doesn't trust us.
He didn't mean that. Stop being so mean.
Our enemy is Yakuza.
They are used to living in the shadows.
They are very capable.
If they are pressed by the hero or the police.
Are you okay?
I'm okay.
Thank you.
What do you want?
Why are there so many people here in the morning?
Hey, wait.
Have they already noticed us?
Forget about it. Just cover your backs.
Why did you wake me up?
Back.
What do you want?
In any case, we have to split our forces.
Ryukyu's agency will take care of him.
Go while there's a chance.
Let's help Ryukyu.
Got it.
Okay, run faster.
The hero and the police.
We have an order to search.
You have been accused of illegal drug trafficking.
Order to search?
Who cares?
Stop resisting.
Just like that big guy.
Are they really not afraid of anything?
Let's go on a short path.
Right to the goal.
Midori, go.
Let's go.
Yes.
Eri.
Wait for us.
This time we will definitely save you.
Eri.
Wait for us.

Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
I can hardly hear them.
I can barely hear them.
No, they run in that direction.
No, they run in that direction.
Are you all right?
All right?
Are you all right?
Fine, it helps.
No, it helps.
I can't feel the feel.
I'm not feverish.
It's very noisy.
A hearse like this makes no sense.
Well, with that no sound, and thus it helps your body feel calm.
Gone people, people are!
All right, I suppose something came out.
Be careful.
Bad idea.
Be careful.
No.
Brown dumped.
No.
Good fag.
Bad idea.
OK.
It's time for the 8th Council of Death.
It's power!
They will win time for us.
We will take Mary and everything else with us.
And disappear into the shadows for a long time.
This is a preview.
The capture of the building is underway.
Chisaki has put his fighters against us.
Amadjiki decides to take the three of them on himself.
And sends us forward.
Every second counts.
We need to save Eri.
In the next episode.
The Sun Devourer from the Big Three.
One of the Big Three will show his power.
And also the friendship between Amadjiki and Togatai.
Get out of prison!
Plus Ultra!
