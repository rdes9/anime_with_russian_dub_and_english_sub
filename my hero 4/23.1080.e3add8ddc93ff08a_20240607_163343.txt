I give up.
You give up?
I've already seen him.
This is the villain who always runs away.
The one who posts quite daring videos.
Great!
Was there anyone else here?
No.
What kind of injuries do you have?
And why is there such a pit here?
I say.
I stumbled and fell.
That is, there are two of you here?
I say.
I stumbled and fell.
That is, there are two of you here?
Right.
Right?
Was there anyone else here?
I smell one of our students.
I smell one of our students.
I smell one of our students.
I smell one of our students.

Where's our student?
Where's our student?
Where's our student?
Pudgy!
I'm ready to confess to all the crimes I've committed.
But my greatest crime was the kidnapping and brainwashing of an innocent girl.
I came up with a good reason to fulfill my own desires,
so all this time I lived for myself.
I didn't regret anything, I fought, it got worse and worse until I only had a heart capable of feeling.
But it's not in my power.
Midoriya Izuku, I'm glad you were the one who gave me the last blow.
It's all my fault.
So I'm sorry, Aibo Manami.
I'm sorry.
No, no.
I... I love you.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
You know I don't want any trouble, but...
What about your injuries?
Did you fight?
I understand that he was up to something bad in the U.A.
So we had a dispute.
But now everything's fine.
Gonchi Pioz, Maktoplaz Msiya.
Did you notice anything, Strelok?
Report.
One video lover decided to give up.
What are you talking about?
I didn't understand anything either.
What?
Well, that's not so important.
Don't lose your vigilance.
You'll tell everything in the police station.
Midoriya Izuku.
I used to study at the Heroic Course.
A great criminal is the shadow of someone who used to be a hero.
Why?
So the world is set up in such a way that for the sake of your dreams you have to spit on other people's work,
passion, and the smile of a girl who doesn't know how to smile yet?
It's not for me to say.
But I hope you can reach out to those who want it.
A bright future.
The Almighty was worried about you.
The class A performance is at 10.
It's already 9.16.
9.17.
From here you can get to school in 5-6 minutes.
I'm sorry.
I lost my bag with the things I had just bought.
Where is it?
I'll go with you.
A great criminal.
Fighting him was not easy.
Midoriya hasn't come back yet.
Why does he need so much time to buy a rope?
Damn it!
It's just the shadow of someone who used to be a hero.
Now I understand why it was so hard to fight him.
It's all because I can become the same.
We have a lot in common with the Almighty.
He did all this for the sake of Labrava.
And I...
Midoriya!
You're late!
Aoyama!
I'm sorry!
Why are you so crumpled?
I fell!
You're so clumsy!
Here's your suit.
Everyone's waiting.
Thank you!
Wait!
Your wounds!
Do you want to go on stage like this?
Everyone will be worried about you.
And they won't be able to enjoy the performance.
You'll make it even if you get yourself in order.
I wonder what Class 1A has prepared.
Yes, very much.
Aizawa!
Young Midoriya!
Yes, we haven't started yet.
Deku won't be dancing.
Don't worry, he'll come.
There are more people than I thought.
It seems that they are in a good mood.
They are impatiently waiting for what will happen.
Has Deku not come yet?
Damn, where is he stuck?
It's starting!
Show us what you're capable of!
Come on, surprise us, first-year students!
Yawairozu!
Yawairozu!
Can you see it, Eri?
Yes.
I...
I just want to see your smile.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Yawairozu!
I wonder if they did it.
What are you talking about?
I'm sure they did everything super cool.
I don't care what you think.
By the way, you should be on duty.
I'll just look a little, just a little.
Some of the students were dissatisfied with everything and constantly discussed something.
They blamed Class A for the situation that had occurred in the U.A.
They didn't come here to have fun.
They came here to criticize Class A's performance.
That's why they don't take this performance as entertainment.
Dance and song?
Even if you've got something cool?
You're just beautiful.
Yoko.
Do what you like.
Let's go, damn it!
The beginning should be spectacular!
Listen here, U.A.
We'll blow you up with our music!
We're glad to see you all!
We're glad to see you!
Lasers!
Human fireworks?
It's unlikely that this is a matter of human hands.
He ran away.
Don't get distracted.
I'm sure he'll be back.
We're glad to see you all!
We're glad to see you all!
We're glad to see you all!
We're glad to see you all!
We're glad to see you all!
We're glad to see you all!
We're glad to see you all!
We're glad to see you all!
We're glad to see you all!
Let's dance!
Let's dance!
Let's dance!
Dad, Mom
I wanna be a hero
I won't be a musician
I'm sorry
Did you cry because of that?
But I can't decide. It seems to me that fighting for others is cool.
You're so cool!
I've always admired the heroes, but I don't want the music to disappear in vain, which I can play thanks to you.
And besides, I love music, so I couldn't tell you.
Kyoko, do what you like.
My mom and I became musicians.
Because we liked it.
At first, your hobby seems to be something ordinary.
Do you think it's cool or did I succeed?
But think about what you will be able to do in time.
Will you be able to help other people with your sound?
If so, then it turns out that being a hero and a musician is the same thing.
Don't stop!
Do you see this? Midoriya!
She smiled!
She smiled!
My name is Romeo!
The ghost of Azkaban, Count Paris!
Give me Juliet back!
Romeo...
Did you hear about your father from Gandalf?
Do you know that he was the king of Gondor?
But it's a lie.
After all, I am your father!
It can't be!
They overreacted.
But it was still cool.
I couldn't stop laughing.
It's okay that you're late.
But don't ignore the calls.
I was in such a hurry that I forgot my phone.
You will be very surprised when you see the list of missing people.
Ektokratko introduced me to the course of affairs, so I know everything.
Just don't think about it!
You didn't seriously get hurt, and the festival continues.
But this is just the result.
You are a student of UAE with a temporary license.
If you want to fight, don't forget us!
We don't just patrol here.
Yes.
Why are you so gloomy?
Get out!
Since the festival is still going, have fun as it should be!
Yes!
Thank you.
All-powerful!
You forget human speech only when you are really angry.
Hi, good job!
You know, at first it was loud and scary,
but then everyone started to jump and dance.
You know, it's not easy.
But then everyone started to jump and dance.
And then there was a flash and you ran away.
And then it got cold and everything started to sparkle.
And then someone next to me said, wow!
And I started screaming too, wow!
I'm glad you liked it.
It's not the time to be happy!
I'm late, and now you're standing with a crowd.
Take it!
Sorry, let me help.
And take mine too.
Cool!
We really liked it.
Cool, thank you!
Yes, it was fun.
You did a great job.
Sorry!
We wanted to spoil everything!
We are very sorry!
They came just to say that.
Victory!
I wonder if there were people in the crowd
who the Aizawa teacher was talking about?
Even if there were, we were able to entertain them.
Exactly!
We were able to excite everyone who came.
Although I'm sure there are those who didn't watch.
We need to make sure that our performance ...
Everything is fine.
We heard what your goal was.
When you were still preparing, we understand everything.
But you need to tell the rest.
It was really fun.
Those who watched your performance will tell others.
That's cool!
Thank you for your kindness.
I don't like it.
Find those who didn't watch and bring them here.
Everything is fine, calm down.
Enough already.
Let's hurry up and get rid of the ice.
Sorry.
Mineta, where are you in such a hurry?
If we don't hurry up,
we won't be able to take good places
in the beauty contest.
Kendo!
Kendo is able to knock you out with one blow!
The price of the integrity of the dress,
it shows itself.
An ideal combination of beauty and strength.
What an amazing performance!
How boring.
You don't know what awaits you.
Okay.
Try to compete with me and my creations.
The beauty queen,
the third year of the support course.
She uses the latest technologies
to show herself.
What was it?
It's hard to say.
The beauty is incomprehensible.
The goal of beauty is to blind everyone.
The third year.
Not bad.
They say everyone liked your piece.
Cool.
You're great too.
And now the third year.
Hado Najira.
Najira.
Hado.
People are the same animals.
I think about them like I think about the mammals.
And it will be easier for you.
Najira lost last year
because she tried to be brighter
than Ken Ranzaki.
And being bright is the power of Ken Ranzaki.
Najira has her own power.
Uraraka.
Tsuie.
Togatairi.
Everyone is so surprised.
It's strange.
I can't stop looking.
Hado looks like
a real fairy.
How beautiful.
A magical dance in the sky.
I'm in love.
Vote for our participants.
The results will be announced
at 17.00
during the closing.
Vote for Ken from Class B.
She is disqualified.
It will be a good evening.
Labyrinth with the ghosts of Class C
looks cool.
Let's go without me.
There is an obstacle course.
We can have a lot of fun.
Yes.
Yes.
It was fun today.
Yes.
Yes.
Eri.
Surprise!
Caramel apples!
Did you sell them?
I couldn't find them.
I looked at the program, thinking that they should be somewhere.
But they weren't there, so I brought everything I needed myself.
By the way, they are very easy to make.
However, I couldn't find the dye, so I borrowed it from Sato.
Well, soon you will be able to see it again.
Even sweeter!
I did it again.
I'm waiting for our next meeting.
Yes.
I'm waiting for our next meeting.
I'm waiting for our next meeting.
I'm waiting for our next meeting.
I'm waiting for our next meeting.
I'm waiting for our next meeting.
I'm waiting for our next meeting.
I'm waiting for our next meeting.
I'm waiting for our next meeting.
I'm waiting for our next meeting.
I'm waiting for our next meeting.
I'm waiting for our next meeting.
I'm waiting for our next meeting.
I'm waiting for our next meeting.
I'm waiting for our next meeting.
Winter
Did you learn all this yourself?
Yes.
I do not believe
Who do you work for?
La Brava.
It would be great if you could use your abilities for good.
Not at all.
I only help the kind.
It's easy to check if you've messed up her brain or not.
So, come on, don't be silly.
She really loves you.
Not all crimes were successful,
but those you confessed to,
you and the girl will have enough.
Oh, I would never have taken part in them.
Our guilt is unequal.
So, it's mutual love.
Here's the problem.
The former student of the Heroic Course dropped out of school.
In order to become a person who removes his crimes,
I can't remember my dream at all.
I probably chose the wrong path.
It's good that we stopped you today.
Those who say life is simple
don't really believe in it.
Or, on the contrary, they want to see at least one result as soon as possible.
Would you like some tea?
Black.
It's the cheapest!
Japan's top heroes!
This is the top of active heroes
who are determined by the number of investigations,
the level of help to society,
the percentage of support to people,
as well as many other factors.
After the departure of the All-Powerful,
the top is waiting for serious changes,
and the one who became the new number one.
In the next episode of Japan's top heroes,
for the first time on the stage,
the winged hero, Yastrep!
Go beyond, plus Ultra!
