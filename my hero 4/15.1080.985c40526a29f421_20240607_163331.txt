And you wanted to become the boss of the underground world?
I hate you.
Especially your arrogance.
Me too.
There are two boxes here, and which of them is the ready-made drug?
Well, it doesn't matter.
Give it back.
You know what?
It's important.
Give it back.
You know what?
You wanted to get rid of other people's magic.
And you used magic yourself.
You gave your whole life to create this drug.
And now it's mine.
Now you can't do anything with it, even if you want to.
Because I took everything from you.
But you know what? Good luck to you.
We'll be the next ones.
To be continued...
To be continued...
To be continued...
To be continued...
There are witnesses, right?
He was noticed in the mountains.
Is he really there?
Kuroger from the criminal league?
Yes.
In two days, we received four messages from the witnesses.
There are not so many people here.
The sources are reliable.
You know, his wonder portal gates can become a big problem.
Nevertheless, he was seen four times.
And one.
I don't understand anything.
Even if we don't understand what the criminal league has come up with,
we need to take advantage of the chance and arrest one of them.
We definitely want this.
We're counting on you, Gran Torino.
You make the old man work.
This is a message from the mountains.
The suspect has been found.
Stay with him until he activates the wonder.
Gran Torino.
I know.
I won't let you.
Finally, we met.
Kuroger from the criminal league.
Gran Torino?
If we caught the most problematic from the league,
we'll deal with the rest without any problems.
Gran Torino.
Be careful.
He can open the gates around his body.
It will be difficult to connect him.
I know.
Then I'll just do it faster.
Thank you.
I won't take my eyes off him for a second.
Gran Torino.
Here?
Have you heard rumors about a monster hiding here?
You don't know?
What?
I seem to have attracted too much attention to myself.
But I had no other choice.
I have an important matter to this monster.
Tell me about it in prison.
What is this?
Our master foresaw the future.
What kind of master?
Remember this.
If I am caught in the near future,
you are the only one who can save Tomura.
When he has problems again,
you can rely on him.
Detective Tsukauchi.
Gran Torino.
Shigaraki was not the only one
who was raised by our master.
It has begun!
One of the most loyal subordinates of the omnipotent.
That one.
The giant mafia.
It's all for the sake of my master.
Chisaki Kai was arrested
for kidnapping a young girl.
He was the leader of a criminal group.
Eight deaths.
He was attacked by a gang of villains
during the arrest.
During this incident,
a sand hero, Snatch, was killed.
In addition,
several policemen were injured.
This is unprecedented
and a failure of police work.
They've been doing this all day.
Don't even think about
taking responsibility for this.
It's not your problem.
But...
You should all return to the academy.
Except for Togate,
who is still being watched.
The rest have been treated by the healing girl.
They will be here soon.
I'll stay here to cure other patients.
Me too.
Maybe I should wait for Eri to wake up?
Your presence will not change anything.
You need to rely on the doctors.
I know, but...
Midoriya.
But I need to visit Togate at least.
I'm sorry.
Could you take a look at my things?
Hey, listen.
It's Midoriya.
I'm sorry.
There you are.
Good morning, Midoriya.
Looks like they want to watch me longer.
But I'm full of energy.
Damn it.
Senpai.
I know.
I lost my magic.
And I lost my mentor.
I have no reason to smile now.
But that's why I...
So, Nagas never was this close to you.
But in fact,
he loved to smile.
Smile.
Society needs
joy and smile
to achieve
a bright future.
That's why I won't be sad.
Someday I'll become
a great hero.
And I don't want Eri
to see me as an ogre.
You have enough power
to become a symbol of the world.
But you're still ordinary.
After all, Mirio is the one
who was supposed to inherit one of them all.
Senpai.
When your magic was erased,
you continued to protect Eri.
Compared to you,
I needed help from Eri.
And then I needed help from my mentor.
If only you were the one
who inherited it,
the class would start.
And the future would be all-powerful.
If I said
I'd give you my magic,
what would you do then?
I don't need it.
Even if it's possible.
Even if it's possible,
and you could give your magic to me,
you'd have big problems.
I don't understand why
you're behaving like that.
But you did a good job.
You're a hero, Deku.
Besides,
I talked to the head yesterday.
If Eri learns
how to give her magic,
she'll be able to bring me back
to that state
when I had my magic.
Even if it doesn't work,
I'll find a cure
to bring back my magic.
I'll have to take a vacation in Yoyi
until I get my powers back.
But I'll be fine.
You'll be fine.
You'll become
the best hero ever.
Night-Eye,
you've foreseen my bright future.
So smile.
Let's laugh.
I'll be back in Yoyi.
Ru Million will save Million.
Okay.
I'll be waiting.
Oh, Midoriya!
Are you hurt?
Yeah, I'm fine. Thank you.
Thank you.
Midoriya Izuku, Kirishima Eijiro.
I'm sorry to bother you,
but we'd like you to come with us
to the station
and answer a couple of questions
about the Eight Traditions of Death.
Okay. I understand.
We were very late
on our way to school.
It's almost too late.
Meanwhile,
we're in Class A.
Bakugo, let's go.
Shut up, I'm coming.
We have to take a time-limited license course.
Hey!
Follow me, you idiot!

There were a lot of papers
in the police station.
We managed to escape
only late in the evening.
Deku! Kirishima!
Uraraka!
Suyo!
You just got back?
Yeah.
There was a lot of work in the office.
I understand you.
It feels like
we haven't been here for a long time.
Yeah.
Let's go.
Yeah.
They're back!
Our guys are back!
We were so worried about you.
That's what the news says.
What happened to you?
Are you okay?
Well, what have you done?
Have some chocolate cake.
Kamino, come on.
You guys are crazy.
Don't scare me like that anymore.
I'm sorry.
I'm glad they're okay.
Okay means good.
Okay.
Oh, Chakutsu,
I'm glad you're okay.
Thank you.
Guys!
I know you're worried,
but calm down.
You saw the news.
They went through a lot.
You're their classmates.
Let them rest from all this.
Not only did their bodies get hurt,
their souls are also badly wounded.
Ida.
Ida!
Thank you.
But...
Keep smiling.
It's okay.
Well, then...
Do you understand
how worried I am?
I'm very worried.
Don't shake him like that.
I'll make you some herbal tea.
It'll ease your pain.
Try some chocolate cake.
Oh, Chakutsu, are you okay?
I...
I could have done something then.
I...
I carried him in my arms.
I had the Night Eye.
You did everything you could.
You did everything you could.
The responsibility is on us.
I can't guarantee
that it'll be easier to live on.
But think about
what you're going to do next.
I...
I want to save...
Yeah.
Why didn't you tell us anything?
We were curious too!
We were curious too!
Sorry, there was an order not to tell.
Kirishima,
are you okay?
I still have a lot to learn.
I see.
Wow, you're so cute!
I owe him my condolences.
Tsu, do you want to hold me?
I'm next.
How cute!
Hey, Kachon, why are you here?
Are you worried too?
Be honest with me.
I'm going to bed.
What? So early?
Are you an old man?
Unlike the others, I have things to do.
Midoriya, Uraraka,
Kirishima, Asue,
I'm sorry, but I'm going too.
What? So early?
Are you an old man?
I see, Bakuga.
But what's wrong with Todoroki?
They're taking a temporary license course.
But they're still early.
I see.
Kachon and Todoroki
are taking a temporary license course.
It's going to start soon, isn't it?
Thank you, Ida,
and the others for the meeting.
Later, we went back to our room,
where everyone was thinking about their own things.
I only heard a little
about what Kirishima and the others were going through.
But I knew that they were going through a lot too.
Too much happened.
No.
Go away.
We're going to save Eri!
And protect her!
It's all right.
I'm going to be your hero!
I'm going to change the future!
I'm not going to let you go again!
She changes people's time.
That's who Eri is.
Eri.
Give me your strength.
If I can't save
even one little girl
on my back,
how can I
be called a hero
who will save everyone?
You've changed the future.
Smile.
Despite the fact that I'm very tired,
I couldn't sleep at all that night.
I'm sorry.
I couldn't sleep at all that night.
I couldn't sleep at all that night.
Follow me, you idiot!
You shouldn't have asked the teacher Aizawa
after yesterday.
I'm not here
to have a social conversation with you.
You.
You're late, bad guys!
A thunder of voices and all-powerful.
Today we are accompanying you.
Look, you need to get things done
after yesterday.
What happened?
It's connected with the girl's
miracle that they saved.
So, look,
the head asked me
to be your bodyguard.
Just a precaution.
Did you grab the Kurogiri from the league?
Yes.
Although it was very difficult.
Did he give you a hard time?
No.
There was another one.
Another one?
He almost left us no choice.
He obeys all-powerful.
To be honest,
I already wanted to drop the Kurogiri.
It's difficult to say
if it was worth it.
It's a walking catastrophe.
We followed him
with reinforcements,
but it was too late.
The search continues
to this day.
I'll let you know
if anything changes.
Well, let's go.
Yesterday was just a class lesson.
But today
the training will be hard.
In short, hurry up
and get your license.
Go!
You can't be late.
Run to the bus.
All-powerful
accompanies us.
It can be annoying.
Well,
let's watch from here.
Do your best!
Wow!
You are indeed the hero number one.
Thank you
for watching.
Worker.
Good.
I just wanted to
talk to you about something.
I'll go
and buy a coffee.
Good news, Shoto.
I have free time.
I'll be watching you tomorrow.
I'll be watching you.
I hope he doesn't meet
the All-powerful.
In any case.
Hey!
Hey!
I hate you.
Your eyes
are just like the All-powerful.
I wouldn't want to
meet him either.
Oh!
What do we have here?
Hot guys.
I'm going crazy.
You can have a great training.
Come here.
Your friends.
Let's exchange phones.
Come on.
Your social skills are impressive.
Teach me.
Hey, bald.
This woman wasn't here before.
Right, she wasn't here.
And I'm not bald.
This is not your dignity.
Students of Shiketsu should not behave like this.
Meat!
Didn't you fall in the first half?
I got permission to watch.
So you're the All-powerful's son?
And you're a real hot guy.
Amazing.
Kemi, you're so brave.
Kemi!
Well,
the time has come.
Yes.
Let's make today's training
more enjoyable.
Thank you for watching.
See you soon.
Thank you.
Thank you.
This is preview.
