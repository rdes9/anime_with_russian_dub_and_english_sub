Oh, look, heroes! This boy was at the U.A. festival.
I don't feel right.
You were already patrolling at the internship.
Did you get a mental injury after the attack of the League of Villains?
No, just so much happened.
I've never encountered such a routine.
Yes, it's really strange.
But everything will be fine.
I took over the main territory, sir.
We just help with the patrol.
I'll teach you everything!
Why didn't the Almighty tell me anything about it?
He was supposed to allow Mirio to inherit one for all.
It's very difficult for me to talk to him.
The Almighty and Night's Eye.
What happened between them?
By the way, we never named each other our hero names.
Oh, right.
I'm Deku.
Deku?
Wooden?
Does it suit you?
It does.
And I'm Rumerion.
I can't save everyone.
But Rumerion is different.
That's why I named myself Rumerion.
As soon as we put on our costumes, we become heroes.
Don't let your guard down, Deku.
Yes, Rumerion.
I'm sorry.
Did I do anything wrong?
How are you?
Can you stand up?
She's trembling.
Look what you've done.
You're making her suffer.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
You're making the heroes feel uncomfortable.
Be careful.
You can't let them suspect something.
It can't be.
So, it's started.
A long internship.
My long internship.
The End
The End
The End
Please forgive my daughter, hero.
She ran around and scratched herself a little.
I don't know how to calm her down.
Chisaki from the Eight Commandments of Death.
Night Eye was talking about him.
Your mask fell off again.
Are you sure you ordered the right size?
We should apologize.
Exactly.
My face.
It's all written on my face right now.
If he suspects something, it can interfere with Night Eye's work.
Cool mask.
You're from the Eight Commandments, and you guys are famous here.
Yeah, but don't worry about the mask.
I just don't like to breathe in the dirt.
It's the first time I see you, hero.
Yeah, we're newbies.
We're very nervous.
Well, let's go, partner.
Let's go to our unknown future.
He's clearly on guard.
I can't tell him the name of the Sera.
What agency are you from?
We're students.
It's too early for us to work in such organizations.
We're just patrolling the area to gain experience.
And we have to go around to lunch.
Right?
Yes.
No, don't go.
Tell me.
Why is your daughter so scared?
It's because I scolded her.
Stop making suspicions.
Let's go.
Yes, but...
The girl grabbed me like this,
as if she didn't want to let me go.
Her bandages won't tell me that she just scratched herself.
She does it too often.
She's trembling and afraid to say something.
I don't think it's normal.
Please don't impose your norms on other families.
Everyone has their own, right?
Stop it.
Chisaki clearly understands that he doesn't want to continue the conversation.
If he becomes more careful,
then we won't be able to track him down at all.
Leave him alone.
No, we'll cause even more suspicions.
It's not normal.
The hero just won't pass by a trembling child.
Wearing our costumes,
we become...
heroes.
This girl...
What have you done to her?
The Hero
God, the hero has been too suspicious lately.
But I understand you.
I'm embarrassed to say this.
Too much attention.
Come with me.
There's been too many problems with Eri lately.
She's constantly changing my routines.
Changing?
It's always hard to raise her.
It's hard, isn't it?
Yeah, it's hard to understand kids.
They think they can do anything at their age.
And they act unthinkably.
What?
Well, have you stopped being hysterical?
What?
Eri?
She's always like that.
I'm sorry for all this.
We've caused you a lot of trouble.
Good luck with your work.
Wait!
Why?
We won't follow them.
Didn't you notice?
He was ready to kill us for this girl.
We can't follow them.
We need to follow the plan.
We'll tell Sero about it.
Maybe he's not that influential.
But this Yakutza knows for sure how to survive.
High walls and few windows.
A modest place.
We've been following them for a week and a half.
And there are fewer people than usual.
What?
This is Mirio.
He says he met Chisaki.
Young people these days are sick as never before.
Chrono, get me a bath.
Yes, sir!
I'm sorry, boss.
I didn't follow her and she ran away.
Take this away.
Yes, sir!
I'm pissed off.
They're sick with the Hero Syndrome.
What?
I'm sorry.
The situation went out of control.
I couldn't think we'd run into them like schoolboys in the hallway.
No, it's my fault.
I should have predicted your patrol.
We're glad you're all right.
If you did something wrong, you could be in danger.
There was nothing to be afraid of.
On the days when the gang of robbers ran away,
they had an accident.
They got into a bus with people.
They turned out to be from the Eighth Council of Death.
But there were no victims.
The robbers felt a lot of pain before they turned it off.
But when they woke up, they didn't find a single wound on them.
And they even stopped suffering from chronic diseases.
They were persecuted before.
I think this is Chisaki's miracle.
In fact, he didn't cause an injury to the villains.
And they were caught thanks to him.
But they said that the stolen money was burned to the ground.
The police decided to stop at this.
They realized that the case was not clean here.
And they searched the office at night to track them down.
We don't know what he's up to.
But a person of this level will not just joke like that.
That's right, sir.
Having met him, we found out new information.
Chisaki has a daughter.
Daughter?
He calls her Eri.
Her whole body was in bandages.
I don't know what he's doing to her.
But she asked for help.
If only I could protect her.
Don't be so stubborn.
But...
The haste will lead to mistakes.
If you chase too early, you will miss him.
You are not special to save everyone in the world.
We sent a request for cooperation with another office.
First, we have to understand what he's trying to achieve.
After the analysis, we have to be well prepared.
The world is not so simple.
You can't save people with just wishes.
Smart villains hide in the shadows.
Know that sometimes you need time for everything.
You two are free for today.
Bubble, let's go.
Yes, sir.
That's how my first working day ended.
After that, I had a bad feeling.
Eri, don't do it again.
You are the main part of my plan.
Don't make me mess up because of you.
Recoverer, you have a call.
Shigaraki from the villains league is bothering you.
He said he was ready to give you an answer.
Yes, sir.
By the way, Kirishima is not here either.
Didn't you hear? He also found a job.
Really?
Hey, how's your job in the studio?
I heard you have a girl in a disguise.
Well...
Stop messing around with his success!
No, don't go.
I was getting more and more depressed.
I couldn't concentrate on the lessons.
It's bad.
I can't go on like this.
All Might is on the run.
Didn't you know?
After his parents left, he started practicing like a madman.
I think it's time for him to rest.
All Might.
All Might, tell me everything.
All Might!
All Might!
Midoriya, my boy!
How did you know I was here?
Did you know about all this?
That the Night Eye knew about one of them all
and that he wanted to be handed over to Togate by a miracle?
Didn't you know that?
Why did you do that?
Do you need this?
Of course I do!
I was attacked with this information.
I almost got rejected before I understood everything.
Moreover, I don't understand your intentions.
I don't understand why you're hiding this
and I don't understand how to feel.
Why didn't you tell me?
I'm not asking as your fan,
I'm asking as your successor!
I don't think you need this knowledge.
Do you really want to know?
It's better than keeping everything a secret from me.
Don't you feel sorry for him?
Yes.
The Night Eye was my loyal fan.
I didn't want to take any of my partners,
but he convinced me and I let him do it.
That's how we worked for five years.
He helped me and was the brain of my operations.
I know, I know that you did a good job.
Yes.
However, six years ago,
we had a fight after my decision.
Our opinions didn't come together.
It's senseless, Almighty.
It's time for you to resign.
They are waiting for me.
And if they are waiting for me,
then I have to go.
If you grow up with such wounds,
people will start to worry.
For the sake of the world,
you have to leave at dawn.
If you're looking for a successor,
you'll find him in my school.
You've worked enough.
There's nothing wrong with taking a break.
It's better to send all your strength to find the same person as you
and trust all your strength to him.
And what will become of the symbol of the world?
As soon as I give a weak point,
someone like him will immediately pull out his head.
I understand your philosophy.
But look at yourself.
Look.
You can't even smile.
I'll say it again.
It's time to retire.
If you keep torturing yourself,
I won't help you anymore.
I can't.
And I don't want to.
Did you see it?
I told you not to look at my future.
Even if you leave,
there will be another one.
Of course, it will be hard for us for some time.
But we are also well-built.
For some time,
how many people will suffer during this period?
All-powerful!
And besides,
you never make mistakes, right?
Because there was no need to change the future.
I will change it.
But at this pace,
everything will go as I predicted.
It shouldn't happen.
I'm here because I want to help you,
all-powerful.
Do you hear me?
The world needs help.
That's why I'm here,
night and day.
All-powerful!
If you lie,
you will face a terrible death
in the battle with the villains.
We have shared our opinion
about my future.
After this argument,
we broke up.
Director Nezu recommended me to Ogatov.
But before I met him,
I met you.
I didn't want to tell you about it.
I'm sorry.
After all,
you are also my fan.
All-powerful
will die?
It was a blow to me.
I...
I already thought about it.
Anyway,
sooner or later they die,
but
to hear it from his mouth...
After meeting you,
I immediately decided to give you the power
and said the decision night and day.
And then he was against it.
So the gap between us
grew even bigger.
You gave one of them to the schoolboy
without a reason?
He wants to become the one who saves people.
One desire is not enough.
There are much more worthy people
in the world than he is.
The middle school student
will also agree.
He is a suitable person.
He called my decision stupid
and thought that young Togatov
was a worthy candidate.
Please, wait!
Wait, all-powerful!
Can we change the prediction
of the night eye?
He said that this would happen
in six or seven years.
The further the prediction, the less details.
But one thing is certain.
Predictions always come true.
So...
already next year?
It can't be!
Why? I don't believe it!
I don't want it, all-powerful!
Live!
Remember, I gave you a promise at the festival?
I promised!
I want you to tell the world
that I'm here!
I...
I can't keep my promise!
Live!
Until I keep it!
Until I become
and tell the whole world
that I'm here!
All-powerful!
Young Togatov,
having heard this prediction,
I accepted it as a given.
I'm going to the end
of my path.
I'm running at full speed.
How come?
When I was fighting with everyone for one,
I thought it was the end.
But you were there.
You accepted my prediction.
All these days
that we spent,
influenced me.
All this time you whispered to me,
Live on!
Grow up and protect it!
That's why I'm going to fight
until the end!
You betrayed me!
I'm going to live!
I'm going to break this fate
with my own fist!
I'm not going to die!
I'm not going to be killed!
I'm going to create a future
that you can't even imagine!
That's what I decided.
Everyone for one.
However,
after all this,
I came to the conclusion
that everything will end as I predicted.
That's why I can't
look him in the eye after all this.
I didn't want you to be
affected by this story,
so that you would become stronger
and not look back.
It is possible that I ended up
spinning the fate myself,
but I don't think so.
Don't tell me
that nothing can be changed.
I don't want this all-powerful.
I refuse such a future.
I...
More precisely, we can change this fate!
I'll try not to cause you
a lot of trouble in the process.
Oh, wait!
Let's meet at night
and use predictions.
Let's find out the details
and change the future!
I'm not going to die!
I'm not going to die!
I'm not going to die!
I'm not going to die!
I'm not going to die!
Let's find out the details
and change the future!
Is it too convenient?
It's a question of life and death!
I'll talk to him!
Wait! Did you think about
the feelings of the night eye?
I'm not going to die!
I'm not going to die!
I'm not going to die!
Let's find out the details
and change the future!
I'm not going to die!
I'm not going to die!
I'm not going to die!
I'm not going to die!
I'm not going to die!
I'm not going to die!
I'm not going to die!
I'm not going to die!
I'm not going to die!
I'm not going to die!
I'm not going to die!
I'm not going to die!
I'm not going to die!
I'm not going to die!
I'm not going to die!
I'm not going to die!
I'm not going to die!
I'm not going to die!
I'm not going to die!
I'm not going to die!
I'm not going to die!
I'm not going to die!
Thanks for watching!
Enhancing the miracle.
In the next episode, show yourself, red rebel!
Kirishima will also show the results of the training.
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
Amaziki-senpai is also one of the Big 3.
But Kirishima-kun and others will be involved in the conflict between the chimpanzees.
How will Kirishima-kun face an opponent who boosts his individuality?
Oh, look, heroes!
This boy was at the festival...
This boy was at the festival, hey!
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
