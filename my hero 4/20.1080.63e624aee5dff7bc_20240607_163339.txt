Today is Saturday, there are no extra classes at Kachana Todoroki today, so after lunch, all the teams will be engaged in preparation.
We need to have a murderous rehearsal with you!
And this is a great idea!
We need to discuss this with the dancers' team!
Wait, we don't have enough people for such a plan!
That's not right, Midoriya!
Use more muscles!
Locking is called that because you need to freeze for a while!
First you need to make a move!
And then freeze abruptly!
Freeze!
It seems that no one has noticed us yet.
I'll try to make a joke out of it and make them laugh.
Oh, Togo!
Eri!
I brought you the best peach!
Togo!

Eri!
Deku!
What... Who is that?!
Togo?
Is she your daughter?
You have some unique gait...
Not bad...
Midoriya...
The director agreed.
That's great!
Great, but the best product is curiousness!
It's a good idea, but remember, Aizawa, this girl has always been out of society.
For a person who has experienced such a sudden camping festival, it can be a little difficult, so...
In order for her not to panic, we wanted her to come here before the festival.
Eri, I got it. You came to us right away from some classes. I'm Ida, nice to meet you.
My name is Neto, and I can't wait to see you in 10 years.
She's a little shy.
Shy?
In general, I want to show Eri to her.
Midoriya, will you join us?
What?
Of course!
Hey, dancers, we'd like to discuss something.
Oh, Ejiri! Hi!
Wait a minute, you don't know me!
Why don't we take a break?
Let's have some tea!
Today is a weekend, but because everyone lives in the dormitory, many students are preparing for the festival.
Oh, what's this?
What? A child?
Just don't say you don't go to school because of this!
Well, say something!
It looks like the truth!
Seriously, this year Class A will show you better than anyone else, so come!
And you too!
I will definitely come!
Can you give me a nail?
Hey, wait, don't hang a poster here!
A whole month ahead, but everyone works hard.
They are trying to show themselves better than last year.
Plus Ultra and all that.
Oh, sorry!
It's Midoriya from Class A!
Hey, what do we have here?
Get out of the way!
Don't you have anything to do?
Hey, are you okay?
I thought it was that woman who fell from the sky.
Hey, are you okay?
I thought it was that woman who fell from the sky.
Fell from the sky?
Oh, you probably thought about Ryuki.
Are you ignoring me?
I heard that Class A is doing some kind of concert.
What do you think?
I will not walk around!
Class B performance will be much cooler than yours!
Romeo and Juliet.
And the prisoner from the cabin.
King's return.
We have an absolutely original plot!
Super exciting fantasy play!
You better get ready!
Because you will have to wipe your tears after our performance!
Today he behaves worse than usual.
Sorry, Class A.
While Kenda is not around, there is no one to stop him.
It seemed to me that she was always somewhere near Manome.
Not today.
She is preparing for the beauty contest.
Beauty contest?
Yes, she was made to participate.
I'm not Manome, of course.
But you should try as hard as you can.
Eri, I'm sorry that you had to see not the best part of U.A.
The teacher did not say anything about the beauty contest.
By the way, this year she will definitely participate in the beauty contest.
Who?
The finalist of last year's contest.
Kado Nedjere.
Oh, hi! Why is Eri here?
So strange.
Why, why?
So great!
I would call Nedjere cute rather than sexy.
Do you remember how she lost last year?
You have a cool charm and wonderful proportions.
Yes, with such a set, you took second place?
Yes, it was.
But listen, I lose every year.
And all because of one girl.
Undisputed champion.
Kenrozaki Bibi.
She is from the class 3G support course.
How cool!
This year there will also be Kendo,
which, thanks to the shooting in advertising, has a lot of fans.
Kado will also try his best.
Just imagine yourself in such a contest,
and also in front of such a crowd of viewers.
From one thought, the animal begins to spin.
The first time I tried to participate, because Yuyu asked me.
And it turned out to be very fun, and I don't want to lose.
So this year I will definitely win.
This is my last chance.
You can do it.
Yeah.
Moving on.
Here we have the support course.
They all work together to show the results of their work at the exhibition.
I heard about it.
They produce an incredible effect every year.
That's right.
The school festival is a place where the support course can happen.
Hatsume.
Wait a minute.
Wow!
This is my superchild, number 202.
You're all dirty.
Washing is an empty waste of time.
Really?
That's right.
At the sports festival, you showed yourself as a hero.
But now it's our turn.
So I can make people admire my children.
I need to make them like this so that they won't be ashamed later.
By the way, how do you like my iron soles?
If you need anything else, just let me know.
Yeah, sure.
Thanks.
Baby!
Again, Hatsume?
Bring me some water.
Sorry, Hatsume.
Let's go, Eri.
Okay.
That's what I was talking about.
Did you get used to it?
I mean, did you like it?
I don't know.
But...
There are a lot of different people who work hard.
That's why I wonder what will come of it.
People call this state excitement.
Director Nezu!
Teacher midnight!
I think it was worth it.
Yes, sir!
I'm looking forward to the school festival, too.
A lot of people work hard without putting their hands down,
have fun, and everything to make others enjoy it.
The police have nothing to say about this.
Don't, Kayama.
I hope you all liked this festival.
Show your patience and cancel the festival.
I can't believe the police chief came to me personally.
The villains are becoming more and more self-confident,
and the heroes are more and more in danger.
So if something happens to Yui again,
I'm afraid we won't be able to do anything.
You're absolutely right. However...
No.
You don't have to give the villains a reason.
I believe that because of everything that's going on around,
the students never need this festival.
We'll take all the necessary measures, so please...
The future shouldn't be even darker!
I won't tell you the details,
but it looks like the director had to sweat.
As a result, there will be much more guards,
and therefore, if the alarm signal is even false,
we will have to cancel the event and urgently evacuate everyone.
Or it will be the last festival.
Strictly.
That's right.
Because of this, we have increased the level of protection,
just so that nothing happens.
We even released a running dog to be on duty around the school.
Released?
By the way, rumors about the presentation of the class A
even among teachers arouse delight.
Try your best.
Be sure to!
So what is it about?
We will have a performance with dancing and live music.
I will dance.
I will try my best to make you happy.
So be sure to come.
Sorry.
Sorry.
The break is almost over.
I need to go.
Okay.
I'm looking forward to your performance too.
And then?
In just a week.
Midoriya.
Sorry, but you...
You're fired from the dancers!
You're fired from the dancers!
I said fired.
But in fact...
The special effects team is taking you in!
They say they need more people.
Why me?
I already promised Eri that I would dance.
They want Aoyama to be able to light up the whole hall.
What do you mean Aoyama could light up the whole hall?
But we don't have the necessary equipment.
That's why they want to attract a person who could lift him.
At the beginning of the performance,
I will turn from a dancer into a live disco ball.
There is no better role for me.
I will gladly help them.
It turns out that I will have a much smaller role.
Sorry.
It's a pity, of course, that you spent a lot of time.
But you can help us.
We want everything to be at the highest level.
The audience will get used to it quickly.
When Aoyama turns into a disco ball,
it will be interesting only at the first moment.
And then, as it seems to me, they will forget about it.
Then why not start moving around the hall in different directions?
Here it is!
Great idea, Koda!
If I can continue dancing, I won't lie to Eri.
Still, it's for the common good.
Okay.
Thank you, you're so cool!
Merci.
After lessons, we usually have rehearsals and such meetings.
I don't have a lot of free time before the performance,
so my training...
It's still hard for you to shoot without stopping or moving.
You have internal bleeding.
Here, apply this.
Thank you.
This happens when I try to control more power than usual.
Maybe there is some kind of trick or something like that.
I don't know.
I could control 100% from the very beginning.
I already told you, when we started our training,
you need to create an image in your head.
That's all.
Strengthen this image in your head and don't forget everything you already know.
I think you just need to repeat it.
You haven't coughed blood for a long time!
Initially, we had no prejudice against each other,
but there is a huge difference between us.
All-powerful, born-to-be heroes.
I'm sorry, no one got hurt.
Hatsume, I sometimes check my children here.
Wait, is that not bad?
She saw us in such a place.
Don't worry.
Thank you very much.
This child is like a third eye.
I'm not interested in her at all.
By the way, Midoriya,
about the new device we were talking about,
I have something that might be useful.
So, what is it?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I have something that might be useful.
So, now I'm improving this thing.
I'll give it to you as soon as I finish.
What?
It seemed to me that you could do this only after the festival.
I'm a kind of artist who has gained inspiration.
I have a basis, so I'll finish everything soon.
Well, kind of.
Thank you.
What? Where are you going, baby?
Wait!
Device?
Well, I wanted to try something related to the new technique.
I see.
I also experimented in the past.
All-powerful, did you use different devices?
I didn't know.
The problem was that the device,
which would add up to 30% to my strength,
was too big.
It would suit me if I had to fight at medium or long distances.
But because I was a close combat fighter,
I always broke it.
And in the end, I decided to fight using only my true form.
You haven't used this form for a long time.
It's a good idea to strengthen your strength with different devices.
But you need to understand that you shouldn't rely too much on them.
Otherwise, you won't be able to show your strength without them.
I've known a lot of such heroes.
Yes.
Okay, let's continue working on the image.
It reminds me of memories.
You're in a hurry, you idiot!
Follow the rhythm!
But you have a new tempo all the time.
I can't get used to it.
Jira, you seem to be a natural teacher.
I didn't think a beginner like Kaminaria
would be able to learn chords in just a week.
That's not so cool.
By the way, the tea smells great today.
Really?
Mom sent me quite a rare tea.
Imperial Golden Tips.
Guys, I'm sorry.
I don't know much, but thank you anyway.
I don't know much, but it looks great.
All-powerful with devices, all-powerful with devices.
What kind of fan am I if I don't know about the past of all-powerful?
Deku, do you want to try the tea I made for Momo?
They have to sell something.
Maybe there's a photo?
Nothing.
With devices, with devices.
Damn, I clicked on it.
Great video.
Dear friends, what tea and what time of the day do you drink?
Yes, and after that.
Thank you.
And specifically, this one is called the Royal Redhead.
Do you know what that means?
You're cool because you can understand in taste.
In the next video that I will post,
the alarm will sound not only for you, my dear,
but also for all people.
Please wait with caution.
Short.
This one is for you.
Thank you.
Please wait with caution.
Short.
This one is for you.
Is he famous?
It doesn't look like people like him.
I don't know much about him.
For example, I know that he is a villain who causes trouble to people.
It's quite bold for him to make such a video,
but he hasn't been caught yet.
I wonder what's on his mind.
Great-hearted, bad thing.
You didn't drink tea this week.
Everything is fine.
Yes.
La brava.
Lately, people are more and more dissatisfied with heroes.
All because they have become quite cowardly.
They are usually not ready for the unexpected.
Simply put, they do not realize that they have a problem.
This is indicated by the fact that they arrange a school festival.
Well, great-hearted,
I don't know what to think when you want to get involved in your children's affairs.
La brava.
This is just a warning.
With my appearance, these future heroes will only become stronger.
All because you are good.
You are so cool, great-hearted.
Let's discuss again how we will get inside, la brava.
I'm opening the criminal folder.
It doesn't open.
Sorry, I put a password on it.
Press the right mouse button.
There are not so many patrols, heroes and few cars on this road.
On the right day at 5 a.m. we will enter this alley and continue moving towards the UAE.
Are you not going to use your magic?
No, because there will be heroes who patrol the sky.
After some time we will reach the large park.
As soon as we pass through it, we will be almost there.
If everything goes according to plan, and we don't make a noise, the road will take 60-65 minutes.
And then, do you know what to do?
There is an unnoticed old house next to the store.
Yes.
This is a cafe.
Are you not going to drink tea from the outside as usual?
This is risky.
The owner is already over 70.
He barely copes.
Few people guess that someone is working there.
There are only five or six permanent employees.
However, I must drink a cup of tea there, La Brava.
Because only in this cafe there is an incredible Imperial Golden Tips.
Don't you think that it is perfect for the job that we want to do?
How great!
And because the owner is already old, the cafe opens at 7 a.m.
We will have 90 minutes to enjoy tea if we come to the opening.
And this time you prepared much better.
After that, we will return to the alley and pass by the building,
from where you can see the mountain that surrounds the forest.
Then we will climb on it and be in the UAE.
Most likely, Gonchiy the dog, who can easily sense the enemy, will be on guard.
When we get to the forest, first of all, we will need to cover ourselves with dirt and foliage to hide our smell.
As for the school gates, there is a security guard there.
There is a security system called the UA barrier.
It protects a large school building.
I'll get into the game there, I'll get into the internal UA network.
How can I turn off the sensors?
Because if I'm honest, I'm a professional hacker.
I really have a wonderful partner.
La Brava, I am infinitely grateful to you.
Come on, I love you.
La Brava, I'm serious.
For the sake of my dream, I learned to shoot.
I posted the first video, but it was terrible.
Almost no one watched it.
And the rare comments were terribly rude.
He was watched only 56 times.
It's been a month since it was posted.
That doorbell was a signal for the end of my gloomy days.
I couldn't hold it any longer, so I figured out where you live.
I'm your loyal fan.
I'll help you write your name down in history.
My first fan.
To be honest, at first I was afraid.
I was so afraid that I was insured.
But when the two of us came up with and edited the video,
they quickly began to earn much more views.
La Brava, I'm ready to put my moustache,
which I really love and adore, on the fact that the plan works.
For the sake of the world, for the sake of others, for the sake of my dream,
and for the sake of answering your feelings.
Great-hearted.
La Brava.
I love you, great-hearted.
You're a great-hearted criminal.
I love you too, La Brava.
I'll do everything.
No matter what.
No matter what.
La Brava, I'm ready to put my moustache,
which I really love and adore, on the fact that the plan works.
For the sake of the world, for the sake of others, for the sake of my dream,
and for the sake of others, for the sake of others,
and for the sake of others,
and for the sake of others,
and for the sake of others,
and for the sake of others,
and for the sake of others,
and for the sake of others,
and for the sake of others,
and for the sake of others,
and for the sake of others,
and for the sake of others,
and for the sake of others,
and for the sake of others,
and for the sake of others,
and for the sake of others,
and for the sake of others,
and for the sake of others,
and for the sake of others,
and for the sake of others,
and for the sake of others,
and for the sake of others,
and for the sake of others,
and for the sake of others,
and for the sake of others,
and for the sake of others,
and for the sake of others,
and for the sake of others,
and for the sake of others,
and for the sake of others,
and for the sake of others,
and for the sake of others,
and for the sake of others,
and for the sake of others,
and for the sake of others.
and for the sake of others.

This is a preview. The school festival U.A. begins.
Early in the morning, I went shopping for everything I needed for our performance.
But there I was waiting for a meeting with Koyakem.
He said,
You will spoil everything after the bite from the imperial Golden Tips.
Next, the deck against the great criminal.
Stop it already.
Hands away from my academy!
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
