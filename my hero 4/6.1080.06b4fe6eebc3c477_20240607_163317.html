        <pre>Oh, Midoriya, hi! Are you going to work at the office too?
What a coincidence!
They didn't call me for a long time, but I'm finally in the business.
They called me, but they said not to take the suit.
What? Hi! Are you going out today too?
Well, yes.
What a coincidence! We too.
Are you going to the station? Let me see you off.
Wow, thank you very much. Thank you.
How many heroes!
How many heroes!
What? Are you going here too?
Kirishima, aren't you in Kansai?
I was assigned a meeting in another place.
We too.
Together on the same train?
We're going to the same station?
What a coincidence!
We're going to the same district.
On the same street.
Wow!
The big three are here too.
And this is...
What's going on?
Gran Tarrino?
And the teacher Aizawa is here too?
The hero of the dragon Ryukyu?
The hero of the police Zhirnozhvach?
Rock Lock?
Kisagiri?
And Mr. Brave?
One of the most famous heroes in this country?
They all gathered together?
Amazing!
I wonder why they're all here.
What's going on?

Do you remember what I told you, girls?
Even if you study and work here, it means you're legal heroes.
And now you'll have to play a big part.
A big part?
Night-watch.
Go ahead, go ahead.
Thanks to the information you gave us, our investigation has progressed a lot.
Today we'll gather everything we know about the eight death tips.
And together we'll discuss what we're going to do with them.
I don't know anything about them.
Death tips? What is that?
I'm sorry, but I don't know much about them myself.
We came here to find out everything.
By the way, you two are involved in this more than I am.
Well, let's get started.
The employees of the night-watch office are conducting an investigation
following the activities of the group called the eight death tips.
Why you?
This happened after the incident with the group of crazy dogs.
Oh, I remember those.
The police decided that this was an unfortunate case,
but everything was so suspicious that we started the investigation.
My name is Long Legs. I'm a partner of the night-watch.
And I monitor their activity.
According to my observations,
recently, members of the eight death tips
have been more often in contact with their clients
and are obviously trying to expand their criminal influence.
They're trying to get more money and other resources.
And recently, their leader
met with one of the group of evil people
under the evil name Twice.
I was following them
and thanks to the police, we found out something important.
The meeting of these two organizations has been confirmed.
So, that's why you called us, Tsukauchi.
It's connected to the evil people's league.
By the way, where's Tsukauchi?
There's new information that he's involved in the investigation.
Oh, boy, I didn't think it would come so fast.
I'm afraid you've been dragged into big trouble.
I don't think it's a problem.
Do you know him?
Yes, I worked with him in practice.
This old man was very powerful.
Midori has such great connections.
Go on.
Having realized the situation, we immediately asked for help in the G.S.
You can skip this part.
Okay. G.S.?
Heroic Network.
It's a network service that only professionals can access.
You can see reports about everything there
and ask for help from a hero with a certain mystery.
With all due respect, Kyohei, why did you bring the kids here?
They don't know anything.
And they can't know anything about this. It's too early.
Stop it!
My guys know much more than you think.
We know, yes.
Actually, I don't know anything.
By the way, I don't know many people here.
My name is Gernoshvatch.
Nice to meet you.
So round and cute.
Here are the candies.
Eight of the Death Commands began to make a lot of money selling drugs.
That's why I asked for help from the heroes who have experience in this area.
Exactly, Gernoshvatch.
You told me about it.
In my time, I destroyed a bunch of such networks.
But on the day of the debut of the Red Bounty,
one of the new substances got into Tamaki.
The substance that erases the mystery.
Erase the mystery?
Hey, Tamaki, are you okay?
Yes, I rested and everything returned as it was.
Look, what a cool hoof.
You ate beef for breakfast.
It's good that you were able to recover.
So this is a temporary effect?
No, I give the word to the Three-headed.
It's a little different from my mystery.
I don't attack the mystery directly.
A gene plus alpha is added to the body of an ordinary person.
In fact, this gene plus alpha is the mystery itself.
And I stop the interaction of a person with this gene.
But I don't touch the gene itself.
We took Tamaki to the hospital for examination.
His factor of the mystery was damaged.
But thanks to the doctors, we managed to restore it.
Did you study the charge that shot him?
Nothing else after the injury was hurt.
Only his mystery was damaged.
The guy who shot him says nothing.
The gun is broken in the scuff.
There are no spare bullets either.
But thanks to the courage of Kirishima,
which affected the bullet with his body,
we were able to examine the contents of this bullet.
I affected? I don't remember that anymore.
What is he talking about? I can't remember anything.
Kirishima, well done.
Cool.
Strengthening, huh? I knew it.
I saw your match.
But after the analysis, we saw something very nasty.
The basis for them was human blood.
Human blood?
What?
Sounds like a horror story.
In other words, it was obtained from a person.
It's a miracle.
Miracle-destroying-miracle.
I don't understand anything.
How is it connected with the Death Council?
It's a matter of the person who was caught by Kirishima
and the drugs he used.
Their network of spread is very confusing.
I spent a lot of time.
I went to groups that sold their options
and I think I was able to get to their source.
There is no direct evidence that the Death Council
is spreading drugs themselves.
But we have found out the intermediary of the Death Council.
And that's it?
Recently, the Ryukyu commander met with a group of villains,
under the control of which one of the leader organizations was engaged.
One of the two giants used a strengthening drug.
There have been many such crimes in recent times,
and we cannot blame everyone for the eight Death Councils.
It seems you really want to blame the eight Death Councils.
Don't you have any more important evidence?
Their boss Chisaki's miracle is called Reconstruction.
It is able to destroy and collect any substance again.
Of course, it can do this with the human body.
If this and the bullets destroy the miracle,
nothing.
Please don't go!
Chisaki has a daughter named Erya,
and there are no records about her.
When Mirio Midoriya met her,
all her body was tied around a bandage.
Is it really that disgusting?
The inside world is cl dunkled.
You can turn any shit into a dream.
What?
What are they talking about?
That's why I said that kids are not needed here.
What else?
So, this bastard Chisaki
makes bullets from his own daughter's body and sells them.
No, it can't be.
It's impossible to say for sure
if they're doing it only for sale.
It's possible that the drugs are only in the process of development.
In other words, this is how they sell it
to test it in the field.
There is no direct evidence.
But if he gathers banks and resources all over the country
and manages to fully develop a drug that destroys the miracle,
I think then they can do whatever they want.
I'm going crazy thinking about it.
We need to find their log.
If these two had saved the girl,
we would have avoided it.
Their actions are my responsibility.
Please don't blame them for it.
Because even without knowing all this,
they really tried to save this girl.
Midoriya was ready to take the risk
and break the order to save her.
And Mereo thought of a plan of retreat
in case of aggression.
And after that?
I'm going to be the greatest hero?
Will Mereo save millions?
These two are already upset with what has happened.
Next time we will definitely protect Eri and save her.
That's right.
That is our task.
This program was produced especially for Gym Club.
The site of the VK group is wiki.com, slash gymfans.
In the next episode
Next time we will definitely protect Eri and save her.
We will save her.
Any way you want.
I'm glad you liked it.
But after this case, they will hide it even better.
Don't you think so?
I don't think she could just run away like that.
In addition to that, the children of the heroes saw her.
Do you think he will leave everything as it is?
I wouldn't do that.
Even if we take them by storm,
suddenly it will turn out that there are no girls there.
You must first make sure that the girl is with them.
He's right.
What do you say, Nightingale?
This is our main problem.
We have no idea how far his plan has gone.
We have only one chance at a blow.
We found all the groups associated with the Death Council
and determined their location,
arranged everything and made a list.
I would like you to investigate each of these places,
so that we can narrow down this list.
So that's why you called for less known heroes.
What do you mean?
Look, the heroes gathered here are associated with the areas of their base.
So those present here will not cause any additional suspicions.
For the former partner of the All-Powerful, you are too cautious.
It's too long!
While we're in the woods, the era has already cried out all the tears!
There is no more All-Powerful.
This is why we must prepare and study,
to bring our strategy to a successful outcome.
We can't rush.
We can raise the noise and not find it.
That's the only thing we can do.
I want to remind you of the case from Spitno.
Maybe they put this weapon on the bandits on purpose,
so that we could prepare and make a mess.
You're thinking too much!
How can you work with such conspiracy theories?
By the way, I have one question.
I don't know how your night vision works,
but you can see the future.
Why don't we tell you what awaits us?
We'll continue in the same spirit, we won't come to an agreement.
I can't do that.
As soon as I activate the miracle,
I need a 24-hour interval.
In other words, I can see the future of one person
within an hour, once a day.
Besides, it's like a memory in my head.
You can imagine that I see a film about a person's life
an hour after activation.
However, this film is just a perspective of a person.
I only see the person and a little bit of the environment around him.
Well, that's enough to know a lot.
Then why do you say you can't do it?
What if a person is waiting for a terrible death?
What will you do with it then?
So our eyes saw the death of the Almighty?
If you continue like this, then you will meet a villain
who will kill you in a terrible way!
It is beneficial to use my miracle when the plan is ready.
To increase our chances of victory,
it is not worth looking at the future when we have so many unknown variables.
What?
But death is also important information.
If we see it, we'll just run away.
It doesn't work that way.
I have never avoided a prediction.
Night Eye, I'll do it.
Just use it on me, I can avoid everything.
I can't.
Night Eye.
Then we act according to the plan.
Saving the girl is a priority.
This is our main task.
We must find out where the child is and save her as soon as possible and more effectively.
I count on your help.
If I had taken her by force then, I would have done it now, Eri.
I see, so that's what happened.
It's terrible.
Deku, this is the first time I've seen such a depressed world.
This bastard Chisaki makes bullets out of the body of his own daughter and sells them.
Eri.
What's wrong with you?
A funeral?
Teacher.
Call me Sotrigolova outside the school.
But I came to talk you out of your internship for this period.
What? Why now?
You heard that the evil league is also involved.
And it all changes.
Next time, we will definitely protect Eri and save her.
Besides, Midoriya, you haven't returned my trust yet.
I would be grateful if you followed the rules and laws to return my trust.
Unfortunately, if I forbid you to save her, you will go again without permission.
I'm looking out for you.
So I ask you to do everything right, Midoriya.
Do you understand me, troubled child?
Mirio, raise your head.
Hey, of course I understand everything.
But in the end, if you sit and be sad, you can't fix anything.
Did you know?
Yes.
I'll tell you something exciting.
That moment when you held her hand, Eri must have felt something other than her despair.
Raise your head.
Yes! Teacher Aizawa!
I said, raise your head.
I will follow you until the end of my life, raise your head.
That's too much.
I'm sorry.
Kirishima, you're so noisy.
Mirio.
I know.
Midoriya, we'll go and save her.
Yes.
In any way.
So that's how it is.
I see.
I see.
You sent Midoriya to me so that I could make peace with the All-Mighty.
Well, I thought the wall between you would at least move.
The older I get, the more often I do what I'm not asked to do.
And how is he?
What do you think about Midoriya and Izuku?
I think they are very similar.
In him, as in the All-Mighty, there is madness that I can't understand.
They are too similar.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Excuse me.
Sorry.
I'm sorry.
Are you sure that you bought him?
Of course.
I tried so hard to buy them for you, don't you have to be afraid of me every time?
If you don't stop, let me go to the police station for shit.
You see, I'm not scared.
Do you want anything?
Okay, okay, if I get in your way, I'll leave, okay?
You will become a nanny for her.
Make sure she doesn't think about running away.
Use the gingerbread, not the clove.
Eri should trust you.
Easy to say, but I don't understand kids at all.
Maybe I should buy some shiny ones, huh?
It's different.
Totally different.
No one has ever held me like him.
I'm sorry, are you hurt? Can you stand? Are you okay?
This kid is trembling and making no sound.
What have you done to this girl?
His hand was so affectionate.
He was so kind.
This is Preview.
While Sir Night's Eyes and the others are looking for Eri,
we students were ordered to stay away.
In my mind, it's chaos.
The future is waiting for the Almighty.
Night's Eye ordered to save Eri.
And finally, the day has come to carry out the plan.
In the next episode, go ahead, Eri.
I'll save you, no matter what.
Go beyond, plus Ultra!
