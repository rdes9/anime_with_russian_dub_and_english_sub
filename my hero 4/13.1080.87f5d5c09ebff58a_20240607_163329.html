        <pre>I thought he was stronger.
Oh well.
Katsukami Riki takes the power from people when he touches them,
increasing in size.
Stop him while he's unconscious.
Got it!
Something's going on inside.
We'd better hurry.
We're a little late, but we have to go after the Night Eye.
Got it!
Huh?
Oh no!
Oh no!
Oh no!
Oh no!
Oh no!
Oh no!
Oh no!
He absorbs their energy, but he didn't even touch them.
The drug has finally worked.
It's working for me.
Now I'm going to take...
Oh no!
... the shot.
The miracle has intensified.
The miracle has intensified.
The miracle has intensified.
The miracle has intensified.
The miracle has intensified.
The miracle has intensified.
The miracle has intensified.
The miracle has intensified.
They are so exhausted that they can't even stand.
Nedjere! Full charge!
Kado Nedjere! Miracle wave!
It can transform vital forces into energy and shoot it.
But for some reason they are spinning in a spiral, becoming very slow.
The effect of drugs is over. Go hug the girl.
Well, no. No!
Uraraka!
I came for help.
Our goal is right behind that intersection.
The professionals are in battle now. We need support.
Girls!
Nedjere! Full charge!
Why are these girls still on their feet?
Every day we say, go beyond the limits, plus Ultra!
Ryukyu! Girls!
Deku!
What?
Well, we just...
Everyone is going to lose weight.
Plus Chaos.
Right?
Calm down. You're embarrassing me.
So you copied me to pull you out?
Yes. With the help of the perfect idea, I created you.
I used your magic to dig out the way out.
And I got to the surface.
As a result, it transforms and lures you to the surface.
That was the plan.
But that's not all.
Listen carefully, mister.
To this day, Yakuza has not allowed us to get close to the child.
Their clan is connected to her?
Right.
Well, if you understand, don't come down and drag her here.
What?
You're a copy, so take the risk.
What?
And Plus Chaos is some kind of revenge for my hand?
Well, you're a copy.
Come on.
What?
You're a copy, so take the risk.
Come on.
Damn, they need to be treated.
I'm such a fool for believing them.
League of Villains?
Take that.
Night Eye!
Take care of the Night Eye, please.
Chisaki!
You've ruined everything.
You're a piece of trash.
I've had enough.
Take that.
This time, for sure.
I'm tired of you.
You grabbed me with a stone.
It's annoying.
This is...
Enough.
Enough.
I don't want anyone to die.
I didn't want this to happen.
But why are you...
I will become your hero.
You will never be sad again.
Do you remember my daughter, Chisaki?
She's my granddaughter.
That fool got mad at the child.
Her husband is dead.
She's cursed.
That's what she said.
One day, her father touched her and disappeared.
The power is hidden in her.
It's not typical for one side of the family.
That's what they call a mutation.
It's not a curse at all.
But this happens very rarely.
I was told that she doesn't control her power
and doesn't understand what's going on at all.
But it reminds me of your miracle.
Look after her.
You ate this dog, didn't you?
It reminds me of my miracle.
It's nonsense.
It's not some kind of recovery or rupture.
A strange power.
This is Eriya's miracle.
They won't give up.
Until they save me.
They're ready to die for me.
I have to save them.
One more time.
One more time.
One more time.
One more time.
One more time.
One more time.
I'm going to jump into his warm arms.
The song is especially for the Gym Club.
The site of the VK group is wiki.com
SlayGymFans.
Eri!
Save her.
Midoriya Izuku.
You have to.
Eri!
Then you missed her.
This time you can't let her go.
I won't let you go anymore.
Give her back.
Give her back.
I won't let you go.
I won't let you go.
I won't let you go.
She won't come back to you.
What kind of hero do you want to become?
Someone who doesn't make anyone worry.
Always won and
always could save everyone.
The End
What was that?
What's going on?
Chisaki!
Kiryu threw me off my heel.
Like from New Gemsher the All-Powerful.
She threw me off with compressed air.
I lost control like when I fought with Katchan.
I didn't explain how to use my strength.
Eri, you can't.
You're my thing.
So I used my power to the fullest?
Wait, wait, wait.
Then my leg...
To fulfill the dream of an old man,
I need you, Eri.
Bad news!
It's all right.
You're at least not his target.
He'll chase Eri to Midoriya.
Then he'll kill Midoriya for sure.
I'll kill him.
We have to...
My body can't take it anymore.
My body...
Deku!
I saw it.
We can't do this.
You can't defeat him now.
So what?
We can't just sit here.
Nobody knows what will happen in the future.
I'll change the future.
Eri!
Fruppi...
There must be a world behind that hole in the wall.
Help him.
Take me, Ryukyu.
Take me with you.
My body is burning.
No, I'm cold.
I used 100% of my strength.
But it's all right.
I didn't break it.
The wounds are healed.
Is it because of your strength?
What?
My body is turning me inside out.
She doesn't control her strength.
She used it in time.
But she doesn't know how to stop.
Right, Eri?
She's turning back in time.
That's Eri's strength.
You can even bring a man back to the monkey stage.
If you keep her like that, you'll disappear.
Everyone she touches will turn to nothing.
Give it to me.
All that's left is to break it to stop it.
If you don't want to disappear, give it to me.
Not at all.
No!
I see.
When my leg broke,
she returned it to its original state,
even before the pain.
It looks like a blessing,
but it's not.
It looks like a blessing,
but it's not.
Now I get it.
The speed at which my body is turning back
means that if I get injured
with even more speed,
one for all.
Full coverage.
100%.
Eri, will you help me?
No.
Neither you nor Eri understand this power.
With a miracle, you can improve by studying them.
I was able to bring the miracle out of Eri's body.
I brought this power to perfection.
And in the end, it affects not only the flesh,
but the essence much deeper.
You can bring a person back
when the miracle appears.
This is what Eri's power is capable of.
The power that can erase the miracle
and bring back the previous order of life.
The power that can destroy the current order.
This is Eri.
Such a snot that doesn't understand its value
shouldn't have it.
You're an idiot!
Destroyer!
The tongue is strong.
By the way, what about Mister?
Go ahead, take it out.
The night-eye needs an ambulance.
Don't touch his wound in the stomach.
Eri's power is growing.
Chisaki said that she doesn't know how to stop it.
Just like me, when I used one for all for the first time.
She doesn't know what to do
and just releases her power.
Chisaki.
Did you start a fight again?
After you, they get into a reanimation.
He stepped on our lawn.
I couldn't do anything.
Respect for us is lost.
We have to show everyone who is in charge here.
And you?
I know that you started a new business
and without my knowledge.
I told you that drugs are not ours.
I understand that you want to express your gratitude.
But you're always exaggerating.
Don't get off my path.
His ideals are already outdated.
Why don't you understand, old man?
Well, it's just a dream.
Yakuza will not restore the underground world.
I will achieve everything myself.
If my plan works,
8 vows for sure.
First, we will distribute the unfinished product.
We will let everyone know that the era of heroes can end.
Everything will work out.
As soon as we lighten the interest,
we will sell the finished drug at a crazy price.
And then we will sell the drug that returns the wonder.
The villains will sell the washing drug,
and the heroes will restore it.
With the help of Eri's body,
we can completely control the world.
And then 8 vows will come out of the shadows,
and Japan will be ...
Chisaki.
I said it wouldn't work that way.
That she is a human,
doesn't it mean anything to you?
If you're going to go against my will,
then better get the hell out of here.
No.
You picked me up yourself.
I just want to pay back.
It's okay.
Just shut up and watch.
I'm your debtor.
These nasty heroes have brought you to this.
When my plan comes to life,
I'll heal you.
You just wait,
father.
None of you
can see what's going on.
I'm going to destroy this world,
its order.
You are blinded by your justice,
which you came up with yourself.
You are heroes.
You're in my way.
If I can't
save one little girl ...
Don't eat me!
How am I going to become a hero?
How am I going to become a hero?
Who will save everyone?
Deco,
are you blind?
It can't be.
I saw it.
Chisaki was able to escape.
Midori lost his life.
This is the future
that I saw.
I saw it.
I saw it.
I saw it.
This is the future
that I saw.
I saw it.
I saw it.
I saw it.
I saw it.
I saw it.
I saw it.
I saw it.
This is the future
that I saw.
I saw it.
I saw it.
I saw it.
I saw it.
I saw it.
I saw it.
I saw it.
I saw it.
I saw it.
I saw it.
I saw it.
I saw it.
I saw it.
I saw it.
I saw it.
I saw it.
I saw it.
I saw it.

This preview.
I was able to defeat Chisaki.
Everything was due to Selire.
But the losses are too high.
Amatsuki, Kirishima, and Zhirna Zhvatch, Rock-Lok,
Aizawa's teacher, Uraraka Yasue,
and also...
In the next episode of the Bright Future,
go beyond the limits, plus Ultra!
