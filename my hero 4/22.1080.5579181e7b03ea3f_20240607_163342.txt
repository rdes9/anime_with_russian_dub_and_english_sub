Wait a minute, please.
Is this some kind of ritual for you?
You're pretty tricky, young man.
Dear viewers,
now you will see the beginning of the adventure of a man with amazing abilities.
Being blind, don't take your eyes off.
I am World Gentleman, which is going to save the world.
Great criminal.
My plans have changed.
This time, I will be short.
Today,
I will try to get into it.
I won't let you do that.
I can't do that.
Great Trumpling.
I'm sure you've sacrificed a lot of strength.
But nothing can beat my moustache and soul.
After the implementation of my plan, I will become a legend.
So don't get involved.
Goodbye,
light of youth.
We all sacrificed a lot of strength.
For the sake of this world,
for the sake of others,
for the sake of dreams.
Their labrava.
For the sake of your feelings.
To be continued...
To be continued...
To be continued...
To be continued...
I recorded you.
I recorded you.
After appearing in the ad, you became famous.
So you will definitely win.
And then B-Class will surpass itself even more.
What's more important?
Then you won't be able to beat me.
Well, since I'm taking part, I'll try to win.
Hey, hey, wait.
Why will Kendo definitely win, huh?
Nothing has even started yet.
Let's compete, Kendo.
I can't wait.
Oh, who is this?
You talk about the winner and forget about me?
I was blessed with an ideal appearance.
Genrozaki Bibimi!
Women's quarrel.
We will be back soon.
Class A performance starts at 10.
And then there will be the first B-Class performance.
Then there will be a break and a beauty contest.
Do you want to see Eri's midori?
Eri-chan!
Hatsume!
Get yourself in order before the show.
I'm already a beauty, aren't I?
Good morning.
Good morning.
What is this?
A permission to leave the territory on the day of the festival?
Yes, he had to go shopping.
So he went to the mountains.
It's about to start.
Isn't he late?
Oh, this riot period.
Great.
You're not going to give up on that guy, are you?
Let's use my magic.
We need to catch up with them.
This is not visible, but the traces of the miracle are still there.
I can do it!
I can do it!
I can do it!
I can do it!
I can do it!
I can do it!
I can do it!
I can do it!
I can do it!
He's on your tail, big-hearted one.
Labrava, I want to keep your tricks until the end, if it's possible.
But, big-hearted one, now the chance of failure is very high.
I know that.
After all, we are taking part in the race with time.
Quick!
He fell earlier because of my air bullets.
What are you going to do?
He fell earlier because of my air bullets.
To restore balance and land, he installed two air membranes.
One above the tree.
We need to remember where they are.
Big-hearted one!
Don't resist!
I ask you to stop!
The usual big-hearted one would have escaped when he was detected.
I'm ready to put my moustache, which I love very much, and my soul to the fact that the plan will work.
After all, feelings have hurt him, big-hearted one.
In the third grade, there is Krateshkaiba.
I didn't talk to her at all.
She wrote me a love letter.
What? Really?
And by the letter it became clear that she was following me around.
Horrible!
And she wrote so much!
The real stalker!
Damn!
When I was in the first year of middle school, I got the courage to give a love letter to a guy, but he laughed at him.
After that, I couldn't believe it at all.
I was sitting behind the computer for days.
Maybe it's better to die?
Nice to meet you, dear listeners.
That's right, I'm a big-hearted, big-hearted criminal.
Those who are sad these days, believe in me and follow me.
I will change the world.
Then I saw the light for the first time.
Which was you.
Dark circles do not go away.
I hope I won't be against him.
I can't hold back my feelings.
I'm your fan.
I want to help you get into history.
You accepted me without any comments.
And you were kind to me.
You responded to my feelings.
You accepted me.
You walked with me.
Aiba Monami, about your nickname.
How about La Brava?
Are we the best duo?
It's the best duo.
I'll hand you over to the police at the very first opportunity.
I love you.
Thank you, Labrava.
Labrava!
A miracle!
Love!
By confessing in love,
it gives the strength of love.
Love!
Love!
Love!
Love!
It gives strength to anyone for a while.
What?
His strength?
And the stronger she loves,
the more strength she gives.
And if the miracle is used in extreme cases,
then the strength increases tenfold.
I'm sorry, young man.
I don't like using brute force,
so I always cut out such scenes.
Please, have some sleep.
I'm sorry, Midoriya Izuko.
I...
fought...
with stronger...
and faster people.
I...
I...
I...
I haven't lost yet.
Good morning!
Hello, guys!
The preparations are over.
We're about to start.
Today we're having a party.
I order you to have fun
from all the classes.
Listen carefully.
School festival U.A. begins!
Impossible, young man.
It can't be.
It was our last hope.
We've always used the love mode
to escape.
The two of us always.
Please, stop it!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
My love...
was not enough.
Who said that your love was not enough?
Great sandwich!
The thinner the sandwich,
the more elegant it looks.
And I don't like
to put it layer by layer.
But I still want
to fulfill the dream
from my middle age.
To go into history
for the sake of descendants.
And now
it's not just my dream.
Today I'll take the first step
on the way to her.
This dream is not so small
that you can forget about it
for some reason.
And if you're a student of U.A.,
you should understand
how I strive for her.
Why?
Why did you choose the festival?
Why did you give up
other people's hopes?
Because that's how
the world works.
So the world works
for the sake of your dream.
You don't care about other people's work,
passion,
and the smile of a girl
who can't smile yet?
If my dream comes true,
then it is.
I dream of
becoming a hero
who will become so famous
that he will stay in history.
I didn't ask about that.
You have troubles, Tobita.
The bar in our school
is not so high.
But you still can't cope
and stay for another year.
Moreover, you failed
the exam for a temporary license
for the fourth time.
I can only advise you to leave
our school.
Takishita is behind the scenes.
The agency is already running.
Don't worry, Mom.
I won't be sad.
I will try.
Call the hero!
The hero!
He will fall!
I thought
I could soften the blow
with my own magic.
The victim suffered a lot.
His full recovery
will take half a year.
In the end,
your actions
prevented you from saving him.
Otherwise,
you hindered the work
of the official service.
You are declared guilty
in this crime.
The spring is beautiful.
You can eat wild vegetables.
I have already forgotten
my dreams.
Takishita!
You have your agency already?
Wonderful!
Do you remember me?
We were in the same class.
What was your name?
And my dream
is already...
Am I going to
grow old
and become more miserable?
No.
Not at all.
Not yet!
Great Spirit!
We used to use the love mode
only for saving.
Great Spirit doesn't like violence,
but...
You can laugh at me
and call me miserable.
I don't mind.
I...
I won't laugh at you,
Great Spirit!
Win!
Great Spirit!
The miracle of the girl
gives him strength.
Why?
You want to become
a hero!
I love you.
And now it's not only
my dream.
Great Spirit,
do you know what we look like?
My dream is no longer
my personal dream.
It was an impossible dream
for my body,
and I tried to forget about it.
But there were those
who didn't laugh at me.
There were those who recognized me.
I want to justify their expectations.
I want to become
the person
who will show people
a bright future!
Looks like it,
doesn't it?
I believe
in the victory of the Great Spirit!
If I can connect
to the internal network of the UA,
the laptop and the program
that I was preparing for this day,
and turn off the security system,
then we can get through!
The network doesn't get out of here
a little bit.
We need to get closer
for the sake of the Great Spirit.
No,
it's dangerous to go alone.
We need to stop her!
I'm still
not as strong
as those
you fought with earlier.
I'll let go of my shame,
honor and principles
to beat you.
I can give such a
respect to people like you.
No.
No.
Side style!
St. Louis
strike!
Out of all the fights
that I've been through,
the hardest one
was with you,
Great Spirit.
Great Spirit!
There are heroes there!
Zbo...
Sasa...
The power of love
doesn't last long.
And it can be used
only once a day.
No.
No.
Stop it!
Let him go!
Let him go, Great Spirit!
Let him go!
His heart was
on this plan!
He even forgot about his favorite
tea parties for the sake of preparation!
Let him go!
What a bright future!
If my only light is Great Spirit,
don't take him from me!
Don't take him!
Labrador.
I knew
you wouldn't run away.
But I told you
to run away.
You can't help me.
You'll get tired
of my accomplice.
Please.
I've already broken my law.
I don't mind, Great Spirit.
I'll be happy
if I'm with you.
Would you be happy
to run away alone?
No.
Great Spirit,
I'd rather die than be without you!
You're going to commit
a much worse crime
than we did.
I brought you here,
took you in,
made you my partner,
and no one else.
Labrador,
I was happy, too.
If the heroes catch you
here and now,
they'll understand that you committed a crime with me.
And if so...
I'll put it this way.
As if there was no battle
to reduce the severity of the crime at least a little.
Go, Midoriya Izuku,
for the sake of her bright future.
Midoriya Izuku,
be proud of the fact
that you defended everything that was dear to you.
I came across a pebble on the way.
Yue,
I give up.

I'm running to my friends who are waiting for me because I want to see how everyone is smiling, including Eri, and now we will start the performance.
Next is the school festival. Go ahead!
You will achieve my feelings. Go beyond the limits plus Ultra!
