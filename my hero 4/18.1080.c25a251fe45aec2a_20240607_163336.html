        <pre>Now 80% of people all over the world have the miracles of their own birth.
To fight the villains who use their own miracles to commit crimes, the hero's profession was created.
My name is Midoriya Izuku, and I fulfilled my dream by entering the UA Academy, where I continued to pursue my dream.
Together with my friends, we are going to the same goal — to save people with a smile on their faces.
And become the greatest of the heroes. Right? This is my Heroic Academy.
We are going to the same goal — to save people with a smile on their faces.
We are going to the same goal — to save people with a smile on their faces.
Hundred of chemicals
Look, look at me.
It's Breakdance!
Breakdance, breakdance!
Dance is her hobby.
Her panties will fly off now!
Mineta, stop talking nonsense.
Asha will probably be able to use dance in battle.
Her body is quite flexible for this.
I will not forget the first training with her.
She then burned my coat.
And during the sports festival too.
I will never forget her.
Maybe I should try too?
So, ask her.
Okay, boy, let's dance.
Yes, teach me.
First, steps.
Step forward, back, left and right.
At the same time, wave your hands.
Like this.
Tasty Sata is also okay.
It's nice to use your hobbies in the work of a hero.
It inspires.
By the way, about the hobby.
Jiro is also cool.
Stop it.
Well, your room looks like a concert hall.
Or rather a music store.
It feels like you're a professional musician.
I told you to stop it.
Can you just forget about my room?
Damn, you'll definitely write an album soon.
To be honest, I...
I'm serious.
Why?
October.
Autumn at the U.A. Academy.
We began to prepare for a grand event.
This event is held in most educational institutions.
Well, we'll have a cultural festival.
Hooray!
Cultural festival!
The most ordinary school life.
Let's decide what to do.
Is the teacher okay?
Will there be no problems?
Kirishima, what are you talking about?
But the threat of villains has not gone anywhere.
You're right.
This is a reasonable note.
However, U.A. is not only a hero.
If the sports festival is a holiday for heroes,
then the cultural festival is for everyone.
For support, general training and business courses,
including.
Besides, it does not attract as much attention as the sports festival.
But everyone is looking forward to this event.
New conditions make you feel a lot of stress.
Don't think that only you have started to experience problems with training.
We can't afford to cancel it.
Yes, you can't just take it and forbid it.
But there are still changes.
There will be fewer invited people.
And the festival itself will take place inside the academy.
We have to focus on the program that we are going to show.
You have to solve it today.
He fell asleep!
I am Ida Tenya.
Senior class 1A.
I will help you decide.
Let's all try together.
First, you need to gather ideas.
If anyone has them, raise your hands.
Me, me, me, me, me.
There are too many offers.
How can I put it all together?
Okay, Kaminaria.
Let's set up a maid cafe.
This is how I imagine it.
And this is how I imagine it with a lot of details.
And this is how I want everything to go through.
Vote for the maid cafe.
Maid.
Service theme is not bad.
Too weak, Kaminaria.
Mineta.
Pussy.
Do you weigh at least a few?
Wow.
Moti store.
I see, a Japanese motif.
Armwrestling competition.
Battle mood.
Bickley house.
I don't understand anything, but it's very interesting.
Pancakes.
The idea with food is always unbeatable.
Dance.
Sounds brilliant.
Hero test.
Just for you, Midoriya.
You can sing a frog song.
Charming.
Contact zoo.
You can go crazy.
With your hands.
What you love.
Battle to the death.
No one is going to die.
Dark student festival.
Wow.
My brilliant show.
Em?
Maybe some stage?
I see.
What else?
Asian cafe.
Dance competition.
Kayaking store.
I think everyone has their own ideas.
I exclude all the crazy, unrealistic and those that I don't understand.
merciless.
Then why did you even ask?
The historical circle will be boring.
Exactly.
It's good, but the rest will be boring.
I can't go against the rest.
We are already studying all the time.
I thought it would be interesting.
Can't we combine our ideas?
I think pancakes and soba will not fit together very well.
Damn, you can't eat in an Eastern restaurant.
Silence!
Let's go to the Bickley house.
What is this?
Silence! Silence!
We will not come to common opinion.
Silence!
Useless meeting.
You have to make a decision by tomorrow morning.
If it doesn't happen, there will be a public lecture.
Public lecture?
It's just a study.
He's kidding, right?
Guys, we have to solve this today!
Yes!
What? Where are the interns?
Additional lessons.
They said they couldn't participate and agree with our decision.
What about Bakugo?
Is he asleep?
Guys, I thought a lot about it.
I'm Stressi, who is taking other courses.
I think we should try to get rid of them.
You're right.
Those who strive to become heroes should not go through this.
In this case, the topic with food will definitely not fit.
We eat so well every day.
There will be no effect of the holiday.
So there is no food at all?
This is my opinion.
First of all, we have to think about others.
If we think so, then it would be rude to have fun for yourself in relation to others.
What to do?
Don't finish the lunch quickly.
Then we have something more festive left.
A maid cafe, a contact zoo and a Bickley house.
A contact zoo?
It's stressful.
Let's make a funny scene.
Watching lovers perform is also stressful.
Why can't we just dance together?
Dance sounds good.
What unexpected support!
Wait a second, I'll find it now.
I forgot what it's called, but I think it's perfect.
Something like that.
I didn't expect this from Todoroki.
When did you have time to love parties, Todoroki?
Never.
I was thinking about the word maid.
And I thought, what should I do to make it fun for everyone?
This idea came to me during the exam.
What did you do there?
I understand.
Songs and dancing.
But isn't it as difficult as putting up a scene?
I'll teach you to dance.
Two steps.
Even an amateur on the side of a hiker learned to dance in one day.
They know what they're talking about.
Wait, lovers.
They dance to the rhythm.
In other words, music.
And without music, there will be no good dance.
But if we talk about the master of music ...
What?
A live concert with instruments.
Wait a second.
What's the matter?
You're really good at playing.
We had so much fun when you taught us to play.
I want to listen to your music.
Ashudo.
Guys.
Hobbies have nothing to do with the profession of heroism.
It's really just a hobby.
And besides, I don't know if I can perform on stage.
By the way, I'm talking about a hobby.
Jiro, it's cool too.
Stop it.
I'm serious.
So that's what it was then.
But you're really good at playing instruments.
Jiro.
This skill can make others smile.
This is a very important ability for a hero.
I understand what you're talking about.
But Jiro herself should decide.
After so many contracts.
And it's not necessary.
It should be rock, right?
Yes!
So the performance of Class 1A will be a live concert!
It's a supply of space!
Yes!
Eri.
Sorry we couldn't come earlier.
I brought a basket of fruit.
Eat as much as you like.
What kind of fruit do you like?
Let me try to guess.
Peppers, right?
Peppers anyway.
Apples.
I almost guessed.
Then let's clean the apple.
Eri wanted to see Midoriya.
Yes.
She's worried about Midoriya and Togate.
It was her first request after she woke up.
Everything will be fine.
You said it would be better not to contact anyone.
And all the more to remember all those horrors.
We were worried that she might go crazy.
However, there are no prerequisites for this.
Considering her condition, this should not happen.
While I was sick here, I was thinking about who saved me.
But I don't even know your name.
I only know Rumirion.
I want to know your name.
Midoriya Izuku?
Heroic name Deku?
Well, I think it's easier to remember Deku.
Deku.
I'm Deku.
Heroic name?
They call me that in real life.
Deku.
Exactly.
Rumirion and Deku.
And...
The man in glasses.
Guys, you suffered so much because of me.
Don't tell her about the man in glasses.
She will blame herself for everything when she finds out.
And it will be too much.
Because of me...
You all suffered so much.
I'm sorry.
She will find out sooner or later.
But now it's too cruel.
Because of me...
Because of me...
Rumirion lost his power.
Eri.
No one is blaming you.
The only thing everyone thinks about is that Eri is fine.
There is no point in apologizing in front of the air.
Stop worrying.
We all tried so hard to see your smile.
I'm sorry.
I can't smile.
Eri.
If you continue, someone else will die because of you.
Exactly.
It will be easier if you suffer yourself than others.
It's easy.
Shisaki's shadow is still hanging over her.
Right.
This girl...
This girl is not yet completely saved.
Therefore...
She can't afford to smile yet.
At least something that will make her smile.
Surprise!
Surprise!
Surprises make people happy.
Wait a second.
According to the doctors, the risk of using the spell has decreased.
The chance that she will lose control is low.
This year there will be fewer people invited.
And the festival itself will take place inside the academy.
Less than necessary.
It is unlikely that she will come into contact with someone from outside.
Teacher Aizawa.
Can Eri leave the hospital for one day?
It's impossible now.
She is in any case.
Then Eri can come too.
I see.
Cultural festival.
Can Eri go there?
Cultural festival?
Eri, this is a great idea!
This is the kind of thing that our school holds.
The guys are preparing a performance and food.
To show and treat others.
Apples!
There are apples in caramel and on sticks.
Apples in caramel?
Apples are so delicious that they look like sweets.
Delicious!
Okay, I'll talk to the director.
This means ...
Eri, what do you think?
I was thinking all this time about the people who saved me.
And I also want to know more about my rescuers.
I will tell you until you get tired.
The main thing is that the director says yes.
Yes.
Now I am free from school and I can go to Eri's date every day.
Meet?
This word is called a man and a woman who meet together.
A man and a woman who meet together?
Toga, what are you talking about?
Boss, a new video has been uploaded.
New post from him.
We don't have a single clue yet, Gav.
Quickly track where it came from.
But every time we find nothing.
Just hurry.
Yes!
Dear listeners, how do you feel?
Today I made a robbery.
I've already seen you.
You are popular on video sites.
Excuse me, but I don't have time to talk to you.
Put the money in the suitcase until the heroes appear.
Come on.
Okay.
Oh, if possible, sort them by the nominal, please.
This can be arranged.
Thank you.
Drop the weapon.
Bad news.
The great heroes have arrived.
Can you handle it?
Calm down, Labrava.
I don't think two heroes will stop me.
Drop the weapon.
Okay, now come.
Labrava.
I know, the great one.
The time has come.
Let's go, Labrava.
Wait, the great one.
You forgot the money.
No, Labrava.
I've already got what I need.
I don't need the money.
I want to write my name down in history.
That's right, I'm the great one.
The great criminal.
See you in the next video, my dear viewers.
The great video.
See you next time.
It's getting more and more complicated.
The great criminal.
Is he joking or serious?
I have no idea.
The great one, the great one.
What's the matter, Labrava?
You don't have so many great views.
Although you were just great today.
Why?
As I thought.
I have to do something bigger.
What will everyone around find out?
It's a question of the century, Labrava.
It's hot.
I'm looking for an answer to it, Labrava.
What makes me more unusual.
And this opportunity will soon appear.
It's hot.
It's hot.

In the next episode,
the most enjoyable is the preparation
for the festival.
Go beyond!
Plus Ultra!
