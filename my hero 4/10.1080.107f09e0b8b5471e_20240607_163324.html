        <pre>My shoulder is finally warmed up!
And you're good too!
It's all in vain.
Not in vain at all!
Thank you!
I sharpened a great spear!
Barrier?
You lost for one reason.
You underestimated.
Just like me.
You underestimated the Red Boundary
and its brave spirit!
In the Battle of the Shields
we won!
We won!
We won!
We won!
We won!
We won!
We won!
We won!
We won!
We won!
We won!
We won!
We won!
We won!
Please don't disappear!
That day we decided to protect
The promise is in my heart
Even if it's a light to disappear
Live!
It's too noisy.
Are they going to do their job?
I don't know what to say. After all, with the vows of death, it is now over.
As long as I and the head are alive, the vows of death will not be over.
Most will follow us and his ideas.
Although I think the head has more will than any of them.
As long as we have the medicine and the serum, we will always be able to get back in order.
This case will be remembered for a long time by all fans.
Even the heroes are afraid of the drug.
As long as it sounds like that, we will always have funding.
In the meantime, get to work, scoundrels.
Okay.
We'll sort it out with everyone, Restorer.
Red! Red Buntar! Do you hear me? Red! Red!
Who are you?
It's me, the fat-eater! I just lost weight! You should have known that yourself!
I... I'll protect you, Fatty. I'll do everything I can.
Kirishima...
I would never have believed that Tamaki had brought someone.
I saw you at the sports festival. I love energetic guys like you.
Tamaki is always nervous and comes last.
During practice, Four Hands told me...
Guys like you raise morale in the team.
But that's all I can do.
I'm not capable of anything else.
I want to protect people, just like Red Buntar.
That's why I asked Tamaki to introduce me to you.
I don't want to stand aside anymore, until something bad happens.
Even in this state, he...
It's over.
It's not over.
I'm not dead yet.
Let's fight until someone dies.
He's so strong!
Did the barrier reduce the power of the blow?
So what now?
I have no more fat.
I'm not fat anymore.
I'm not fat anymore.
I'm not fat anymore.
There's a medical center nearby.
Take care of the wound of this guy.
This guy.
Is that a trap?
Do I look like someone who sets traps?
Rappa, don't be selfish.
You're under my responsibility.
You should be responsible for your actions.
I'm not responsible for my actions.
I'm responsible for my actions.
I'm responsible for my actions.
I'm responsible for my actions.
I'm responsible for my actions.
I'm responsible for my actions.
What?
Think about who you're serving and why a monster like you is here.
What's your duty, Rappa?
You have no power to create a barrier.
So shut your mouth.
My bones are broken too.
I can't raise my hands.
Then what do you want?
Fight until someone dies.
I'm here from the underground fighting club.
You've probably heard of such a fighting club where you can use your magic.
No one could stand the blow of my fist.
And those who could didn't want to live anymore.
Do you understand me?
More than you can do whatever you want.
The power of man is ready to sacrifice his life.
That's the kind of battle I wanted.
But now I feel great.
You two are just great.
Especially red-haired.
I especially liked him.
Let's fight again.
Heal your wounds.
We'll meet again soon.
They'll arrest you and put you behind bars.
Do you understand?
There won't be a next time.
It won't happen.
Until I'm not dead, it's a draw.
It's not a draw.
Is he really just a madman?
His investigation is striking with personal motive.
We can't continue the operation with such wounds.
Kirishima, you called yourself pathetic.
But what now?
When Tamaki brought you, I immediately decided to take you.
The one who realizes his weaknesses.
I want to deal with him.
With this man.
Now you don't feel sorry for yourself at all.
And you showed your brave spirit.
Which even the enemy recognized.
One has gone forward.
He can be ignored.
It's much more important to stop the next group.
There are only a few minutes left.
In this case, I have to do it.
You're all just heretics.
You can't be here.
Hurry up.
Let's catch Mirio.
It's...
The floor!
The walls and the ceiling!
He's close.
He'll crush us.
There's nothing left of us.
That's enough to stop the bleeding.
Now you need to rest as you should.
Is he healthy?
I'll kill him.
When would he have time?
I want to ask you something.
It's strange to hear such a thing from a hero.
How did you end up in this useless gang?
I...
I lost the battle with the Restorer.
Lost?
He came to our club
and asked me to join his gang.
Of course, I wanted to find out the relationship.
And then I died.
And then I recovered.
After that, I called him to battle five times
and lost every time.
I'm here until I beat this man.
He lost?
Wait a second.
Are you saying that Chisaki overcame his speed and strength?
Even though Chisaki is so strong,
he makes his six fight for him.
Why doesn't he fight himself?
Does he run away?
Doesn't he run away from us?
What did Chisaki think?
It's none of your business.
You can't talk to the enemy.
He wants to restore Yakuza.
Rappa!
I didn't get into details.
I just heard from the conversations.
He plans to spread something and restore influence.
Stop it, Rappa!
He needs money for that.
As I understand it, he doesn't need us to fulfill his plan.
These vibrations...
Usually calm Irenaka
has become really serious.
Rock Lock!
Stop ordering!
This is all happening because of your miscalculations!
Shut up!
Everything I block
remains in place.
The name of the hero is Rock Lock.
The spell is a lock.
He can lock any object.
But his spell doesn't work on living beings.
He can't lock
fast objects or objects of a huge area.
Come here!
This side won't change anymore.
And don't complain about the density.
I can't cover huge spaces.
This is the limit of my capabilities.
I can't miss them.
I just can't.
He attacks again
beyond my limits.
One for all.
Full coverage.
Side-by-side style.
Destroyer!
He can go through the wall
as he wishes.
Like the blood of a warrior.
It would be easier
with Zhirnov's team.
Look at his head.
He knows exactly
where we are.
Where he's watching from.
Straight from the wall.
They'll destroy us at this pace.
They'll just drive us into a corner.
It's almost over.
No, not yet!
Destroyer!
This guy again.
It's no use.
Our goal is to save the girl.
That's the most important thing.
Ryukyu and the rest.
The heroes.
The police.
Kirishima and Zhirnov.
I won't let them disappear
from the path they've created.
Now we can't be stopped!
Destroyer!
Destroyer!
It opened?
What is he planning?
Where is he?
It was made especially for Jam Club.
The site of the VK group
vk.com slash jamfans.
I'm sorry.
Don't worry.
Why did he split us?
Hey, are you okay there?
The voice of Roklok.
The walls are not thick.
He changed the strategy
when he couldn't crush us.
He gives us freedom.
But why?
So we have to pay for this freedom.
Be careful.
Someone is coming.
Shut up.
It's all your fault.
And here you are.
Stop!
The League of Villains!
Quiet.
You made a mistake.
Right now I'm
a pitiful mafioso Toga
from a morally outdated organization.
But she's still a bad girl.
Rok, what's the matter?
Wipe your head!
Please step back!
Roklok!
A double appeared
and attacked me.
Be careful.
Look at both of them.
We have new enemies.
Knife wound.
Midoriya, are you okay?
Yes, we need to follow Chisaki.
A double. Knife wound.
It seems that their relationship with the League of Villains
is not the best.
I see everything.
Toga the chemist.
That's Toga.
I'm so happy.
I'm so happy.
I'm so happy.
It's a matter of the block.
But if we can stop her now,
that's it.
Toga the chemist.
Teacher!
Teamwork.
The League of Villains and Eight Vows
united together.
He opened the walls for us
so that the League of Villains could act.
Teacher!
I'm fine.
What's more important, stop Roklok's bleeding.
I heard Toga use the blood of the victims.
Yes!
Hearing how they killed their people,
I excluded such an opportunity.
You know, Shigaraki,
I didn't think he could
obey someone.
It's the blood
of the transformation.
The same thing
that can't happen this time.
What did you think,
the League of Villains?
I'm so happy.
Have you ever played
in Shogun?
No.
I haven't played.
Hey, play!
I don't want to.
I don't know the rules.
Don't say that.
You could at least learn.
I could teach you something.
Shogi is interesting
because you can use
the enemy's figures.
For example,
Kurogiri
or Buntarku Togu.
They can do anything
to calm you down.
The most useful figures.
Are you trying to destroy us?
They are the cornerstone
of our operation.
I won't give them to you so easily.
Let's work on trust.
Right now we are still enemies.
I told you about my plan.
Now it's your turn.
Your partners are very important to you.
It's so boring here, Shigaraki.
It's never been so fun!
I wanted to meet
some cool heroes.
But you look like an ordinary clerk.
Don't underestimate Yakuza, you moron!
Take him,
brother of the slave!
You hit me.
But you are strong.
What happened?
These are my support items.
Combat seals.
Each one weighs
5 kg.
It's made for humor.
Because a businessman
should have his own seals.
Prevent and strike first.
Maybe because
I saw the future of many people.
In combat, I move a little faster
than everyone else.
Although I could not predict
this.
I didn't think that the famous
League of Villains would help
Yakuza.
Yakuza is useless!
Damn!
Go to hell!
You put it too late!
Just a second and he would have killed me!
If you help,
do it better!
Look!
My mask was torn!
Bad, bad!
I'll split!
Great!
I'm crying again!
Don't!
I need to finish everything!
Or I'll split in two!
Look, they split like eggs!
Toga!
We have to overcome so much
to help!
Let's meet, Toga!
You're a devil!
What's wrong with these psychopaths?
It's so sad!
You feel
responsible for Magno's death.
I stepped over myself
and decided to help.
Let's get married!
No!
You must be having a hard time, Jin.
If our partners
don't come in handy,
they won't get any rewards.
Work on eight vows?
Yes.
Don't make me repeat it.
Their plan is good for us.
Toga and Twas are now in Yakuza.
That's not funny.
That sounds interesting, Shigaraki!
They don't know
what they're doing.
They asked for Kurogiri,
but I refused.
This guy has
almost reached his plan.
You'll get through
their territory.
What other benefits do we have?
Do you think you're a leader
if you behave calmly?
Have you lost your mind?
He killed Magno
and deprived Mr. Compressor
of his hands!
I brought him here!
I brought him to us!
I'm just a Shigaraki!
Shigaraki!
Toga, tell him!
Tell him something!
Who are we to you, Tomura?
What are we?
I'm in the League of Villains
because I'm comfortable here.
Pitno gave me inspiration.
I want to create a world
where I can do
whatever I want.
I liked everything
up until now.
Tell me, Tomura,
why do we have to do
this hard work?
You know,
it's for me and for all of you.
They want to throw us
from the top of the world
and at the same time
lure the best of us to their side.
I want you to get as close
as possible to their throats.
I never thought
they were equal to us.
Twice, you said
you wanted to atone for your sin.
I'm giving you a chance.
I...
I believe in you, guys.
Shigaraki,
I still don't understand
what you meant back then.
Do you trust us?
But I'll do
everything I can.
I want nothing.
We'll do
whatever we want.
That's why
Yakutsu will definitely die.
They're really hopeless.
I'm sure
that your boss
is a useless piece of shit.
He's completely useless.
What the...
Brother Ranaki is too easy
to get rid of.
The weakest ones are the most ferocious guys.
I'll beat those
I don't like.
Even if I ask, they'll still refuse.
That means...
From this moment...
We'll play together, heroes.
Destroy
and kill them all!
Let's go!
Let's go!
This is a preview.
As we break through
the corridors,
Togata moves on
without any problems.
And finally,
he catches up with
Chisaki and Erii.
And a desperate fight begins
between Chisaki and Togata.
Togata is out of control.
And finally,
he catches up with Chisaki and Erii.
And a desperate fight begins
between Chisaki and Togata.
In the next episode,
Rumerion!
Wait for us, Togata!
We'll catch him together!
Go beyond
plus Ultra!
