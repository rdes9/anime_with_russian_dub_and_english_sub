So, we're going to have a cultural festival.
Cool fest!
Each class has to perform something.
I see. Songs and dances.
Well, if you're talking about a master of music...
What?
But you're really good at playing.
After so many contracts, it's not necessary.
It has to be rock, right?
Teacher Aizawa.
Can Eri leave the hospital for one day?
Cultural festival.
Can Eri go there?
THE HEROES
The Almighty has always been in charge.
The classes of people who call themselves heroes.
They are called heroes.
Those who went down in history.
But on the contrary, there was a leader.
All for one.
The chief commander of the army of DESTRO meta people.
And an incomparable thief.
Harima Oji.
These are the most famous villains who went down in history.
Until the superhuman society was legalized.
Until there was a significant difference between heroes and villains.
The world was plunged into chaos.
However, chaos also means freedom.
It was pure freedom.
Never seen before.
Nice to meet you, dear listeners.
Here I will tell you about the adventures of an uneducated talent.
That's right. My name is Great-hearted.
Criminal Great-hearted.
Great. Great-hearted Great-hearted.
Oh, my Great-hearted.
La Brava, did you upload the video?
Yes, Great-hearted.
But the recording was deleted again.
Therefore, I uploaded everything anew, starting with your debut video.
Every time in shock from your video with a copy replacement.
Ha-ha-ha-ha.
I do not expect less from you, La Brava.
Great job, as always.
Hot!
Well, let's go to the shooting today?
After being elegant, let's finish this cup of coffee.
This is Great-hearted.
Criminal Great-hearted.
I upload videos of criminal actions on the Internet sites.
But I ask you not to rush with conclusions.
I'm not just doing this.
For example, robbery of a store in the days.
J-Store is the largest network among mini-markets.
But they did not allow themselves to sell expired pudding.
People repeatedly complained about the expired marking.
Despite this, the company pretended to be a fool and did not take responsibility for their negligence.
Do you understand?
This is how I punish those who behave not like gentlemen.
I am a modern thief, gentlemen.
This is so upsetting, Great-hearted.
What's wrong, La Brava?
I mean the video from J-Store.
It gained little views.
Our audience has no taste.
You were just great, Great-hearted.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
If you look for approval of others, you will not go far, La Brava.
But, but, but, listen.
You have been active in the online field for six years.
And then this thief appeared and stole all the fame.
And he has nothing to do with the video.
Now everyone is talking about the League of Villains.
They are too cruel.
This is mean.
You are right, La Brava.
Their cruel behavior is like a circus.
And I am very different from them.
However...
They caught Hype Train.
There are more than 10,000 comments under their video.
Meanwhile, my comments look like this.
He does some dubious things.
J-Store doesn't care about anyone.
He's just a loser.
This pisses me off.
Too weak.
Show more, La Brava.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
But I am a good person.
I am a good person.
I am a good person.
But I can't be broken, La Brava.
La Brava, why?
Because my project will surpass their next one.
How wonderful.
And what does it consist of?
What's your plan?
A question for the whole generation.
I want to give an answer together,
which will be said for a long time.
This is what I plan further.
The interns are still on the job, aren't they?
Agan!
I'm sorry.
Don't apologize.
We will continue to work on the festival for you.
Choreography, costumes, how much do you need to plan?
What do you think people will like the most?
We will choose the most popular, right, Jiro?
Well...
Did you hear?
Heroic classes will show a concert.
For us?
General training.
For us? What are you talking about?
What's that?
They think only about themselves.
They are really too careless.
Even though they were attacked by villains,
they allowed themselves to be attacked again.
So many people were injured because of them.
But thanks to people like us,
we managed to bring everything back to normal.
It was their fault, and they will never admit it.
There is only one month left until the festival.
We have little time. We have to start today.
First, let's choose the music.
What will we choose?
I don't know much about such things,
so I will agree with your opinion.
Me too.
Since we are doing this for everyone,
we need to take something popular.
Something very rhythmic.
And dance.
If we put all your opinions together,
then club rock in the style of new rave will suit us.
If we rely on dance,
then electronic dance will suit us.
But we don't have anyone who can play difficult instruments.
Does anyone play the bass guitar or drums?
That's what I thought.
The backbone of any music is drums.
I mostly play the guitar,
and I still learn how to play drums.
If I start teaching a beginner,
then a month is definitely not enough.
It's hard to be honest in a month.
Didn't you say that in childhood
you were forced to go to music lessons?
What?
Really? What a surprise!
Bakuga, bang on the drums!
Find someone else.
It's too hard for you.
Well?
Wow! Cool!
What a talent!
Bakuga, king of drums!
What?
I don't want to do this stupid thing.
Bakuga, please!
At least do it for me.
Do something good.
What's good about it?
Is that right?
You guys want to relieve stress from other courses?
Do this for the sake of relieving stress?
You're doing this for yourself.
And they won't accept it from people who are angry.
Stop saying that!
How else can I tell you about it?
Well, if you think about it,
then we did not consider this issue carefully enough.
You didn't want to participate in the discussion,
and now you're saying this.
Don't you care about it?
Did we ask the villains to spoil our reputation?
These egoists, in the last place,
care about what we feel.
If you want to relieve stress from these freaks after this,
then think again.
We have to teach them a lesson.
We have to fight with their insolence.
And we have to treat this more seriously.
Hey, I'll kill everyone with my music!
Bakuga!
His reason scares, but he will do it.
Now he's serious.
Incredibly serious.
He's cheating on himself.
I'm always serious.
That's how it is.
Don't, Deku!
In the summer camp, Bakuga was kidnapped by the villains.
And he carries a heavy knife.
Good, Jiro!
Yes.
I'll do my best.
Hey, great soul, tell me.
What's our next step?
A month later, the annual event will take place.
We have an academy in our country
that protects the strongest.
The academy that brings up young heroes.
Do you mean that very academy?
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
I plan to get in there.
And where am I finally?
I'll do a great job.
On the keys.
The synthesizers are the basis of club music.
You'll help me a lot, Momo.
I'll try.
I wanted you to dance with us.
But it's much more important.
I play the bass guitar.
It remains to find the usual guitar and vocals.
So everyone else will dance?
Yes, but I already doubt that we have enough people.
In that video with the dancers.
We need to add scenic effects.
That's what I'm talking about.
Effects?
Something like this.
Light, sparks, disco ball.
Everything that will make an effect.
Let's have a parade.
The happiest places on earth.
We are not enough.
Can we practice in the gym?
Yes, the teacher Aizawa has already prepared everything.
Then what if ...
What if ...
Uraraka throws Todoroki and Kirishima up?
And Kirishima will break the ice Todoroki.
Aoyama will be a disco ball.
They will together create the most sparkling disco ball.
Let's call them the snowman team.
Human snowman machine.
Great distribution of roles.
I'm a disco ball?
Sounds good.
The gym will look spectacular.
Yes, good idea.
How many people do we need to work on the decorations?
Here we are.
Sorry, we're late.
We're finally done.
Now we can help you for real.
I see.
We chose club rock in the style of a new rave.
I still imagine Yohirozu on the keyboards.
And Jiro on the bass guitar.
But Bakugo on the drums ...
It's amazing.
I don't believe it myself.
You have problems with this.
Well, who will perform the vocals?
Who will be in charge?
Well, we haven't decided yet.
And I thought you were going to sing, Jiro.
What?
Do you want a great vocalist?
Then I can handle it.
I can be a disco ball and a singer.
With good instruments, I will sing well.
Man on the ship.
You must find your dream.
Isn't this another genre?
He's just screaming.
I agree with Sochaku.
It should be you, Jiro.
When I heard you sing,
it was very cool.
Stop working on me
even more.
Everything will be fine.
Are you going to ignore
the screams of our showers?
And how good is she?
I want to hear your voice, Jiro.
Sing for us.
Everyone
wants to
sparkle
like the stars
in the
night sky
In this
wondrous place
filled with
all the dreams
I've been wishing
for
waiting for
the chance
That's enough.
That's enough.
The guitarist is always the main thing in the group.
I can't get to the riff
because of the design of my character.
I will dance.
Me too.
I can do tricks with my tail.
I work on decorations with my ribbon.
What a great drink!
You can play.
Why didn't you tell me?
I have problems with the first F chord.
The first problems of new guitarists
begin with the F chord.
Mineta,
can't you trust me with the guitar?
I'll replace you with it.
Do whatever you want.
It's stupid.
When will this stupid festival end?
Everyone has some talents.
Mineta, I'll give you the singing part.
Will you go dancing?
I'll go!
What time is it?
Around 1 a.m.
Great!
All roles are assigned!
Music group!
Stage group!
Dance group!
Guys, we'll start training tomorrow!
Yes!
Did you hear your class
preparing dance performances?
Sounds fun.
Sounds fun.
Yes, we still have a lot of work to do.
I'm looking forward to this event.
So, what did you want to talk to me about?
We haven't talked like this
for a long time
alone.
During the internship,
I was able to force myself
to use 20% of my strength.
And that was because of the strong tension
in my body.
But even then, I couldn't handle it.
If there was no Eri,
I would have lost control
and died right away.
I can't oppose anything
with a long-range attack.
I thought about it,
but I can't think of a decent strategy
how to fight.
So far, I can't reach
100% of my strength.
Did you go to the dead end?
Yes.
I can only tell you one thing.
You have to have
long-range attacks.
I also want to
speed up the clouds like you.
I want to get out of here as soon as possible.
I had a lot of them.
I already thought about it.
I came up with something for you.
Let's go outside.
Change into sportswear.
Do you want me to use 20% of my strength here?
Yes, full coverage.
But...
If I do that,
I won't be able to move
and immediately lose all my strength.
That's why I wanted to
raise my physical strength first.
Forget it, full coverage.
Got it.
One for all.
Full coverage.
20%!
20%!
Now hit
in any direction.
Closed air!
I was going to teach you
when you get over 15%.
I was surprised
that you didn't understand it
in the last fight.
But most likely, you just defended yourself.
You are already capable
of destructive attacks
with compressed air,
not injuring your body.
But then my body...
Think about what your body went through.
First,
you use 100% of your strength
on one part of your body.
Second, you controlled
your whole body.
Third, you used
your whole body.
Fourth, you created
a side style
using your legs.
Fifth, you moved your limit
up to 8%.
Sixth, you learned
to raise your limit
up to 20% in a short time.
And now,
the essence of today's lesson.
Do you believe or not?
I didn't use 100% of my strength.
Right?
If the Almighty
always used 100%,
he would destroy everything around him.
Here it is.
Can it be?
I can use 20%
just at the moment of the blow.
I can connect the second part,
control one part of the body
and number six, raising the limit
up to 20% in a short time.
It's easy to say,
but it's hard to control.
You need to approach
this question delicately.
And now I have a question
for you, Midoriya.
Which part of your body
do you control best?
Right.
Start training
with your fingers.
One for all.
Full coverage, 8%.
And now,
20% of the limit.
Up to 20%.
You need time
to master it.
Thank you, Almighty.
Now I see my way.
Learn to control the miracle
perfectly.
Go beyond the limits.
Excellent!
We're here.
Everything's fine.
Everyone's welcome there.

Well, after work, I always choose tea depending on the type of work, this one is called Royal Flash, do you understand what it means?
You have such a clear taste!
In the next video, I will tell you how the alarm signal will sound for our entire society. Be careful, friends!
This is a preview. We are preparing for a cultural festival, and Eri came to visit us. Meanwhile, the criminal Great Soul is preparing for his plan.
When the Great Soul finishes drinking tea, he will begin to act. And the name of this tea in the next episode is Golden Tips Imperial!
Then he will come to the UAE.
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
