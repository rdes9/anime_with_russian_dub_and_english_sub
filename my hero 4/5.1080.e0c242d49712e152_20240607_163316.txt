The two villains are in a fight!
Both of them have the magic of gigantism.
We're asking for help.
Send the heroes!
Full charge! 30% of power!
Spiral splash!
Blind wave!
Listen, why are you fighting?
Listen, why are you fighting?
Did you argue whose miracle is bigger?
It's so strange.
And now you two!
Crown hit!
Meteorite rain!
Great!
Listen, it's really great!
Nervous?
I did what I could.
I was calmer than I thought.
It's not for nothing that Nedger recommended you.
You both are just great.
Nedger perfectly took the time to attack.
Hero number nine in the ratings of the greatest!
Hero-dragon Ryukyu!
Nedger and Hado are Rukyu's partners in the hero's office.
In Chako Uraraki Asui Tsuya Nedger was invited.
Thank you for the chance to show yourself.
Yes, yes.
Hey, Ryukyu, did you know where these two worked before?
The first years don't really have a choice,
so they got into a useless agency.
Didn't I tell you?
Even if you still study, you can see how your strength has grown from just one task.
I think you'll do well for one serious job.
Work?
What?
A request for help from the former partner of the Almighty.
Night Eye.
Night Eye.
Is this where the deck works?
Yes, this is where the teams work together.
Well, you already know.
And what do you need support for?
We need help in detaining the group of eight deaths.
The presence of the evil league is also expected.
To be continued...
To be continued...
To be continued...
You've been driving me around for 30 minutes.
Am I an ant to you?
And you call yourself Yakuza?
We did it to get rid of the overdrive.
What can our guests think of?
A lot of roads intersect here.
This reception room serves as a temporary shelter.
We're still alive only thanks to our caution.
Let's get down to business.
I'll discuss your words on the phone.
You were serious.
You said you'd join us under certain conditions.
You've got it all wrong.
Are you going to join the glory of the great villains?
We're looking for a way to expand.
And our goals coincide.
Get your dirty foot off the table.
Where are you, dear guest?
Haven't you been taught manners?
And don't forget to bow to me.
First of all, we don't work for you.
Secondly, we do what we want.
Secondly, we have to be equal.
And then we'll help each other.
That's the only condition.
And there's something else.
The plan you were talking about.
Tell me about it.
It's a reasonable request.
I must know why you use our name.
And...
No sudden movements.
I see you're very angry.
Who did you think you were?
Who did you think you were?
Do you think your pieces of meat that you use to protect yourself are equal?
It was an unequal exchange.
Plus, you owe us a hand of compression.
If we don't get any concessions from you,
then you won't be worth anything to us.
Don't touch him, Chrono Mimic.
He didn't go that way.
Let's listen to him first.
You didn't finish him off.
I think I've started to understand what your plan is.
I think he's somehow connected to this.
It makes no sense, doesn't it?
In the last few days, hooligans have been trying to start a fight.
I'm hungry.
Our agency needs a combat type of hero.
A red rebel sounds perfect.
Get ready for any job.
Four hands didn't want to take the student to work,
so I'm glad you invited me.
You should have gone to the world.
Omojiki, introduce me to someone at work, please.
Please, please, please.
Don't spit at me.
You kept pushing me, and I got scared.
You'll be a great hero, Tamaki.
Then we'll fix your mental health.
You're pushing me even harder.
As always.
This man invited me to his place to torture me.
I want to go home.
Maybe he's trying to cheer you up.
I think so.
Jerdash, are you eating again?
As always.
I can't be as optimistic as you and Mirio.
Sometimes I feel the same.
There were times when I couldn't do or say anything.
The gap in experience and abilities between me and the other classmates
has increased.
That's why I try to reduce the gap between us.
This is called early optimism.
Drago, anyone for help?
It's them again.
Stop, you idiot.
They're trading on my territory without permission.
Damn, stop chasing me.
I just started gaining a reputation.
Let's split up.
I won't let you.
Fatty.
No, don't move.
This is for you.
Damn, where are you going?
A miracle like a blade?
Ew, smelly octopus.
Why do you have to be rude?
He's not rude, he's just shocked.
It's not a bad word.
And now not an octopus.
Malyuski is effective both for attack and for defense.
That's why I eat them every day.
U.A. Academy.
Third year of training.
Amadjiki and Tamaki.
The miracle of transformation.
It can turn your body into anything you ate the day before.
The right hand took the shape of an octopus.
The left hand is a preserved malyuski.
And the wings he got from a fried chicken.
The wings were too much.
Damn.
I didn't do anything again.
I hope I got it right.
That was great.
You used your miracle perfectly.
Our sun eater is stronger than many professionals.
He would only have to put his snot in his fist.
Right?
Well done, sun eater.
You're so cool.
I need to help
my brothers.
Oh no, get down!
After they got into the compressor,
he couldn't use his miracle.
What is it?
What are you planning to do with it?
What are you going to do?
Tell me.
I want to restore justice.
I heard that one person
is in charge of the stolen miracles.
I changed his method a little bit.
I'm going to grow all over the country.
Brother, run!
Well done.
Brother, run!
Little by little.
Sun eater,
red button!
I'm preparing
my plan.
I'm going to catch him!
Is he broken?
It hurts less than I thought.
Are you okay?
Great!
I'm going to catch him!
I'm going to use my leg.
I can't activate the miracle.
Stop!
Wait, be careful!
Keep your ears sharp!
Sun eater,
I can leave this place to you.
Wait for other heroes.
I'm not wounded, but my miracle doesn't work.
He erased the miracle?
Get away, don't follow me!
Stop running!
You want to help your friends, don't you?
Don't be mad at me!
You're running away after I shot you?
It's low!
There's nowhere to run!
Get your teeth ready!
You're too noisy!
Red counter-attack!
Here's my answer.
Did you get your cow with a gun?
What?
Is he crying?
My blades don't even reach 10 centimeters.
The knife is longer.
It's not fair.
I just wanted to save my bros.
I'm scared.
At least praise me that I was brave enough to shoot.
Stop it!
If you're so afraid of such things, then you shouldn't have started.
Come on, can you stand up?
I want to be stronger.
I was driving strong guys to become stronger.
I understand you, but...
I'll go get my bros.
I can become stronger.
Some hero thinks he understands me.
Of course.
Don't you dare say that!
What did you do?
What was that?
Are you okay?
What?
What's going on?
What's going on?
Thank you for saving us.
These guys were selling drugs at the crossroads.
With your help, we finally caught them.
So my magic turned off one of your devices?
Die, stupid bastard!
We'll take care of the rest, don't worry.
Kirishima.
Fatty.
I have a bad feeling.
He suddenly got stronger.
I heard about it in the news.
They're using magic on cats.
If they use them so openly,
it will turn into a nightmare.
We have to finish him.
Run away!
You may get hurt by his blade.
He cut me.
His blade is stronger than mine.
What are you doing?
That's all you can do?
What were you talking about?
You were talking about being weak?
The Brutons said that the Heroic Age is coming to an end.
Soon we will rule the society.
I feel stronger than anyone else.
Get out of the way, kid.
I'm going to save my Brutons, like I said.
Don't think about tricks.
Use your magic.
Go ahead like a bulldozer.
Even though the Almighty said so,
I don't know where to go next.
I don't know how to compete with you guys.
Your magic allows you to be mobile
and attack far away.
Except for Kaminar.
Ask him to charge his phone.
I don't have anything like that.
Even now I'm getting away from you.
What will happen when we become professionals?
How can I not get away from you?
I didn't expect you to start complaining.
I'm not complaining.
I'm just talking, got it?
Stop whining about getting away from me.
Didn't you say you'd hold out
even under my explosions?
I'm going to be a horse that never shakes.
Remember the last battle of the Almighty?
If you don't attack,
then you're damn strong.
This is stronger.
More.
More.
Body and soul.
Get stronger.
Even stronger.
I will become
the one who never falls.
That's what I've achieved by practicing magic.
This is the maximum I can do
Unbreakable Red Buntai.
What's that sound?
Is his body creaking?
I can hold him for 30-40 seconds.
That's enough.
Don't break me.
Get your teeth ready.
I've got something else.
Get away from me.
There are people behind me
who couldn't run away.
There are a lot of people in the building too.
I'm going to force him to direct all the blades at me.
I'm a strong man.
No tricks.
Go forward like a bulldozer.
Overcome the enemy.
Crown strike.
Red Cannon.
What a brave young man.
Wow.
Hey!
I'd be a little late.
Don't come any closer.
He's back to normal.
He fell asleep so quickly.
I just wanted a little strength.
Let me go.
I'm just stupid that I wanted to get stronger.
I can't.
You were shooting at my friend.
But I understand your feelings.
I'm the same in the past.
Who cares about your stupid story?
I'm the stupid one.
Freedom.
I'm saved.
I'm running away.
No one can catch me.
I'm sorry for being late.
Fatty.
When you face a villain,
know what their goals are.
Kill, run or get hurt.
That's the only thing they think about.
We have to catch them,
save them and neutralize them.
Remember this lesson, red bandit.
The key to victory over the villain
is your ability to break his will to victory.
E.M.T. hero.
Fatty.
A miracle of fat absorption.
He can absorb all attacks with his body.
Totoro.
I had to use all my strength to win.
But he finished everything instantly.
Thanks for the help.
Thank you.
You were incredible.
Now we're your fans.
You tried so hard to protect us from the blade.
You're an amazing hero.
The majority would be scared of his blade.
You really saved us all.
You had a good debut.
I had a completely different one.
You saved a lot of people today.
I guarantee you,
you'll become a good hero.
Thanks.
Listen, what's your name?
What should we call you?
I'm Red Bandit.
Oh, I'll never forget your name.
Thank you, Red Bandit.
Thank you.
Why am I not going forward?
I became closer today.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Not at all.
His miracle got stronger.
These drugs are banned in Japan.
As far as I know,
they're not very effective on those
who live in Asia.
They work on representatives of North America
for up to two hours.
You know so much?
I used to work with the police and caught
these guys in crowds.
We found a gun wreck.
He managed to break it with his miracle.
It's not an ordinary gun.
We'll do an analysis
and let you know.
Okay, thanks for the job.
I see. Senpai, are you okay?
Shame.
Because you can't use a miracle?
It'll be terrible for any hero.
Besides,
you protected me.
Just like Mirio.
You're the same type as him.
You're very bright.
You're saying weird things.
If you think that way,
you're also very bright.
You're amazing.
I know that.
Let's take you to the doctor.
It wouldn't stop me from going there.
But first, let's go to the agency.
Okay.
Got it!
So drugs that strengthen miracles
were created to help those
whose weak miracles prevent them from living.
I've never heard of anything like that.
I have a bad feeling about this.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I want to stay alive!
Let's go!
Keep us there!
Keep us there!
The new Red Buntar made some kind of a villain.
Sounds very cool!
Tsu and Uraraka are also in all the news.
So, let's see, new assistants in the Ryukyu agency.
Saves the city after classes.
I'm so happy.
I never have time to take pictures.
That's cool.
You will have a lot of fans like a mountain lady.
I envy.
That's true.
Two cute heroines immediately figured out the complexity of the situation,
using amazing abilities.
Although we have a temporary license,
but at work we become heroes.
Great job!
However, the student's duty is to study.
Schoolwork is prohibited.
Okay, Ida.
We will show stubbornness, right?
Yeah.
You were afraid of your marks.
What, will you study?
The teachers helped me prepare additional assignments.
I should have gone to work too.
But it's hard to do both.
All people study differently.
Exactly.
I continued to think about it.
About the reasons why all the powerful Night Eye broke up.
About how the Night Eye wanted to make one successor to the world.
I don't know all the details,
but I understand the situation.
And at the same time,
don't leave.
Every day I remember this girl.
This is a preview.
The Night Eye gathered for a big meeting.
Other agencies
discussed the upcoming case
about the upcoming detention and eight death sentences.
The girl whose hand he let go.
The Night Eye uses evil people.
In the next episode, an unpleasant discussion.
This time I will save the Night Eye anyway.
Get out of prison! Plus Ultra!
