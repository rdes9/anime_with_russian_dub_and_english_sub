No one of you can see what's going on.
I'm going to destroy this world and its order.
I'm blinded by my justice, which I came up with myself.
You're just pretending to be heroes.
Get out of my way!
After you get hurt, you get yourself together again.
If I use my speed at 100%, I'll be able to stop him.
And then he won't have time to recover.
If I can't save one little girl...
How will I become a hero?
Who will save everyone?

This is the first time I've ever felt this way
Don't hide the scars
I've decided to live with despair as my weapon
I'll share my tears with you
I'll give you everything
Please, don't disappear
I've decided to protect that day
I have a promise in my heart
Even if the light seems to disappear
Go!
It's been so long
It can't be
You couldn't lose, Kai
I've been watching you all this time
From the moment we were kids
You always put your best effort for your goal
If Kai wins
I'll have to run away with the prepared substance and the
Iverdka
For the sake of the eight death commandments
For the sake of Kai
You're Chrono, aren't you?
Senpai!
I'm so glad
Rumi, are you okay?
How are the others?
Deku is there
Eri, aren't you hurt?
Eri's miracle
It's getting stronger
You got into a fight because someone called us villains
We're Yakuts and we can't get up
What you did was bad
But thank you for protecting us
To our honor, Chisaki
War Art of Gunhead
Ura Viti, report the situation
Night Eye is behind me
We asked for evacuation of the locals
Deku defeated Chisaki, but
Something's going on with him
Oh no
Stop or you'll die
No matter what you do, this is the end of the world
No matter what you do, this is the end of the world
No
Killing other people
You're cursed
Enough! Enough!
I'm sorry, Midoriya
Enough!
Enough!
It stopped
It's...
Save the wounded
Find all the doctors you can
Hurry
Check the territory for other victims
The members of the villains are hiding nearby
Find them
Got it
Whole village is in danger
Here
The transmigration says that she fainted
Take her to the hospital
You need to go too
Can
Yes
His pulse is weakening.
Faster!
Night-Eye!
Night-Eye!
I forgot to tell you!
Midoriya...
The future I saw didn't happen.
I don't understand how it happened.
But you made my dream come true.
Midoriya...
You changed the future.
The Almighty said he would live!
He said he couldn't look you in the eye!
But you have to see him again!
You can't do that!
So...
Hold on!
We need to hurry.
Step aside.
Midoriya...
They're all seriously wounded.
So, our fight goes on.
But...
Thank you.
So, the battle for the life of a little girl...
...was over.
The rescue operation is complete.
We're transporting 11 members of the Council.
They're all seriously wounded.
We'll take them to the Khodokan Hospital.
Their personal belongings have been confiscated.
We also found bullets and a capsule of unknown content.
What's this?
Is it all about eating someone else's king?
It's not that simple.
Yeah, they're here, as you said.
From the Council base to the hospital.
That's the shortest way.
Thank you for letting us know.
Toga, you exceeded all my expectations.
Actually, it was Jin who asked me to call.
Fight!
I was busy thinking about the language.
Run!
I'm sorry you'll have to get your hands dirty yourself.
I only have one hand.
We couldn't capture the girl.
But he managed to finish his medicine.
We watched the actions of the police.
So there's a good chance you'll find what you need.
Kill them!
Say hello to us.
It's...
Shigaraki Tomura from the League of Villains!
Hey, lizard! Stop talking to the car!
I'm sick of it!
Actually, I'm not a lizard. My name is Spinner!
Shut your mouth!
Are you really offended?
The attack on the police doesn't go with the will of the spot.
That's wrong.
I'm not sure about them anymore.
This is a necessary victim, Spinner.
Don't get distracted by the road.
So...
Who is this?
The League of Villains.
The evil spirit who desires the evil community.
Hero, of course. How can I live without you?
Spinner, slow down!
Perfect!
Everything you touch with your five fingers will fall apart.
But you can't do anything with sand!
My natural enemy.
The famous hero.
Shigaraki distracts him for us.
Utun?
Go!
The magic of the flying car.
The agility of the hands and no fraud.
Are you okay?
That's right.
The hero always saves others first.
The murder series has recently begun.
All the victims are dead.
Oh, so I'm in the news.
I've been dreaming about it for a long time.
Have you ever thought about the feelings of your loved ones?
It's hot!
The sand doesn't burn, does it?
As far as I've noticed, the sand doesn't burn.
And you wanted to become the underground boss?
You came to kill me.
No.
I came up with something more interesting for you.
I hate you.
Especially you, Shigaraki.
I hate you.
I hate you.
I hate you.
I hate you.
I hate you.
Especially your high degree.
And me, too.
There are two boxes here.
And which of them is the ready medicine?
Although it doesn't matter.
Bring it to me.
You know what, Recoverant?
You wanted to get rid of the other's pretense.
But at the same time, you used the pretense.
If you don't stop the decay, you're gonna die.
Great.
Now you're out of strength and you can call yourself powerless.
You've spent your whole life creating this drug, and now it's mine!
Now you can't do anything about it, even if you want to!
Because I've deprived you of everything!
Well, you know, good luck to you!
The reinforcements will be here soon. Let's go!
Next... will be us.
Ah! Ah!
It's a special voice-over for Gym Club, VK.com or GymFans.
More than half of the policemen were injured
by the miracle of one of the eight deaths,
Riki Katsukagi.
The others helped the wounded
and took care of the destruction.
Chisaki destroyed four houses with his own miracle,
but only three were injured among the civilians,
and they were just scratches.
Maybe a daily morning helped,
but it's a miracle anyway.
Hey, you know what? You can say thank you to Deku.
Deku?
I was unable to help, but I saw everything.
He pushed Chisaki high into the air
and pushed him back into the hole.
He tried his best not to cause any damage.
I can't even imagine how hard it is.
Meanwhile, all the wounded heroes
were taken to the hospital.
I looked at your body,
but I found nothing but the damage to your hand.
Thank you.
And how did your hand end up in such a state?
It's much more important to help others.
I've already checked them.
Teacher, you're wounded!
I've got ten stitches. Come with me.
I'm sorry I wasn't there when I needed it.
Oh, come on.
What's more important? How are the others?
Kirishima is covered in wounds and bruises,
but he will live.
The bones of Amadjika's face are broken,
but he will come to his senses soon.
The fat belly has broken bones all over the body,
but he didn't see anything like that.
The knife that wounded Roklok
didn't touch the vital organs.
He suffered the least.
Thank God.
And what about Sere?
The fever doesn't stop and she doesn't come to her senses.
She's in a quarantine zone.
A quarantine zone?
So we won't be able to see her?
Such a decision was made after you gave her the information.
She can't control a miracle that brings people back to life.
If she can't cope with emotions again,
I'm the only one who can stop her.
Do you understand what her strength is
and decided not to spare her body in battle?
Yes.
Not everyone would have decided to do this.
After all, who knows?
What if she accidentally killed you with her own miracle?
You're right.
Don't look at Eriya's miracle.
I don't know how it would have ended then.
Her miracle doesn't work on anything but people.
It's not safe to learn to control such a miracle.
It doesn't matter how strong she is to control herself.
Now the quarantine is the best solution for her.
It's for her own good.
Simply put,
we can't count on her miracle.
What?
Better take it as it is.
It's just in time.
The Almighty!
The healing girl!
Why did I call them?
Because Sir was constantly thinking about the Almighty!
Avada Kedavra!
We can't do anything else.
To be honest, it's a miracle that he's still alive.
You can't do anything with my power here.
I don't think he'll live until tomorrow.
Night Eye.
The Almighty.
Have you come to visit me at the deathly hell?
I don't know what to say to you.
I've done such a terrible thing to you.
Night Eye!
Live!
Fight!
You're blaming yourself too much.
I don't blame you for anything.
I just wanted to be happy for you.
If you've decided to fight against fate.
You have to fight too.
I beg you, let me atone for what I did.
There's nothing to apologize for here.
I wanted to change the future in which you were killed.
I've been looking for a way to change it all the time.
But it was all in vain.
And today Midoriya showed me how.
I think everything is connected with energy.
A strong energy that leaves no room for doubt.
Energy that changes the future.
But Midoriya was not alone.
All our efforts have created this energy.
But in the end.
It was Midoriya who used it with Cere.
And he changed it.
The future is uncertain.
You changed my mind.
I have nothing more to regret.
Although no.
There's something.
Cere!
Senpai!
You can't!
I beg you, live!
You can't die like this!
Mirio.
You went through so much trouble.
If only I knew.
Only!
Thanks to you!
I became so strong!
I became so strong only because you taught me!
Teach me and go on!
Mirio.
Forgive me.
I took you.
Because I thought you were a suitable candidate for one of all.
But you believed me so.
I respected you so.
Mirio.
You.
Everything will be fine.
You will become a unique hero.
Don't you dare to change this future.
I wouldn't want that.
So.
Keep smiling.
Smile.
Society needs laughter and energy.
To lead us to a bright future.
To be continued...
To be continued...
To be continued...
To be continued...
This is a preview. The battle with the Eight Sages of Death is over.
Together we were able to change the future, but the problem has not been lessened.
Now we are caught in grief due to the loss of the Night Eye.
And the League of Villains will make its next move.
In the next episode, Flowing Fire!
It looks like a calm before the storm.
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
