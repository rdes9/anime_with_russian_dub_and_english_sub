The Hero's Office specializes in heroic activities, so all the students studying for heroes try to get a job right there.
During one of the internships, I ran into the killer of the heroes, Stein.
Back then, I didn't have a license, but now everything is completely different.
I can use my skills under the guidance of a professional.
I can also go to the Abyss and fight against villains.
And if I do well at work, I will be able to become a partner of one of the professional heroes.
I will also be able to hire other heroes from the office.
I chose Midoriya Izuku for my first job.
The office of the former partner of the All-Powerful, Night Eye.
But first, I had to overcome his challenge.
If you don't want to be rejected, you have to, before the end of the first conversation, make him laugh at least once.
Laugh? I'll do it!
To become the number one hero!
I'm Midoriya Izuku!
Are you laughing at the All-Powerful?
That's not funny!
That's not funny!
That's not funny!
That's not funny!
That's not funny!
That's not funny!
That's not funny!
That's not funny!
That's not funny!
That's not funny!
That's not funny!
That's not funny!
That's not funny!
That's not funny!
That's not funny!
That's not funny!
That's not funny!
That's not funny!
That's not funny!
That's not funny!
That's not funny!
That's not funny!
That's not funny!
That's not funny!
That's not funny!
That's not funny!
That's not funny!
THE END
The All-Powerful has no wrinkles here.
The wrinkles near his eyes were 0.6 cm and 0.8 cm in the Silver Age.
Even the manufacturers of souvenirs and toys of the All-Powerful take this into account.
Don't you even know that?
He has a badge of the All-Powerful all over his office!
It's a plaque in honor of the 10th anniversary!
I want it!
No doubt! This man is the biggest fan of the All-Powerful!
I'm not happy. Go away.
Do you remember the case of the vinegar incident?
Don't you remember?
Save me! Save me!
A middle school student who could change his trick by drowning in the river.
And the All-Powerful saved him!
Now everything is fine!
Why?
Because I'm here!
The boy turned all the water in the river into vinegar out of fear.
And when the All-Powerful jumped after him, saving him,
his eyes were very sore from the vinegar.
It hurts so much!
That's why he decided to scratch a funny grimace!
That's the face I imagined!
Of course I remember that.
It was before I became his partner.
It was only mentioned on television.
Yes, that's the case!
There were no villains in this incident, so they didn't talk much about him.
They didn't even discuss it on the fan sites.
But I liked it all, especially when he thanked the boy at the end.
Thank you very much! Thank you very much!
You're welcome! Thank you!
I felt 10 years younger.
That's my favorite phrase!
Are you testing me?
No, it's just that the All-Powerful teaches here.
It's so uncomfortable to talk about him.
So I remembered and got carried away.
The essence of this incident was the daily life of ordinary people.
Yes, that's right!
I don't understand.
What kind of weight can simple words hold?
Mirio, what kind of guy is he?
We're studying together.
But even though you didn't manage to make Sarah laugh,
you managed to step over an important threshold, Midoriya.
I see.
So you want to work in my office and become stronger.
Yes, please accept me!
This is a copy of the school contract.
It's ready!
Don't interrupt me until I finish.
Okay!
As soon as I print it, you'll be able to work for me.
Yes!
Working in the office is radically different from regular internship.
Your life will be much harder.
You'll have to work here for at least a month.
Your work will be paid according to the law.
For you, as for the first year, the time of the lessons will be reduced.
And you won't be able to move at the same pace as the class.
I understand that.
But if I move like them, I will never become the best in the world.
You missed.
I'm just not going to put it on.
What?
This job will help you grow.
But what will I get from your work?
There are already two partners in my office.
What office is good for a first-year student?
What is good for you?
What can you give to society?
If you can contribute something to society, show me that.
Answer me these questions.
The Almighty showed his power and humor what he is worth.
He instilled fear in criminals and hope in people.
That's why society accepted him.
What can I bring to society?
What can you do for my office?
And I want you to show me, not tell me.
Three minutes.
You have only three minutes to answer me.
If you want to be a hero under my leadership,
you have to put this seal on yourself.
What?
I give a chance to a person with complete lack of sense of humor,
and I ask you to appreciate it.
What do you say?
I am quite merciful.
Mirio, Bubble Girl, leave us.
Yes, sir!
Where is your spirit?
Yes, sir!
Mirio, did you have to go through this too?
Sir personally chose me, so no.
You're not doing it, are you?
You're really his favorite.
Damn!
I envy you, so you know.
Damn!
However, Midoriya's business is very bad.
He is expected only in the dark.
Faced with the wonder of the era,
it is impossible to fulfill this task.
I didn't even touch you with my fingers.
You can do anything.
And don't worry about the safety of the room.
Just take it.
Night Eye is a miracle.
No, you need to focus on the seal.
To become number one,
you have to overcome this, Midoriya Izuku.
One for all.
Full coverage.
The attack is ahead.
Do you want me to think so?
From above.
I see everything.
That's what I thought.
That's what I knew.
You need to diversify the attacks.
Hurry up and show me.
What do I have to hire you for?
So far, you're completely useless.
Maybe he's just playing with him?
Maybe.
But I can say, knowing him,
Sir was serious.
Is he really not going to hire Midoriya?
One minute has passed.
First, you take a breather.
Then you'll feel despair.
And then you'll understand that you can't do anything against my foresight.
Sir Night Eye is a miracle of foresight.
By looking into the eyes and touching the target,
he can predict the action of the target all the time.
All these conditions are a secret.
Diversification of the attack will not benefit.
Do you have a way to overcome his foresight?
I put my hopes on you, but I guess I was wrong.
You have the spirit to become the strongest,
but you're too ordinary.
The villains become more and more active,
and the world is darkened.
In such times, Mirio should have inherited one of them all.
One of them all?
How long?
I love and respect the Almighty with all my heart,
but I don't understand his choice of heir.
I put my hopes on you.
That's what Night Eye said.
So, Togato was initially a candidate in the successor?
Does Togato know about this?
How the Night Eye and the Almighty chose him.
How the Night Eye and the Almighty chose him.
How the Night Eye and the Almighty chose him.
Did the Almighty know about this?
If he knew, why didn't he tell me?
I see you have a lot of time.
Or have you already given up?
Do you have a plan?
When Mirio told me that he would introduce you, I held back.
But I think it's better to tell you directly.
While there is a man more worthy of one of all than you,
I can't accept you.
The words he said to me that day.
You can become a hero.
That's why you'll be next.
These words...
To surpass him, to surpass him,
until he can react,
I won't let him refuse me.
After everything we've been through together,
the Almighty chose me!
He chose me!
I will put this seal on you!
I will make you accept me!
The foresight of the Night Eye allows him to see the future.
But I don't know how far.
Therefore, it is necessary to increase the speed of movement
so that he does not have time to think and react.
While there is a man more worthy of one of all than you,
I can't turn around after he told me that.
These movements are a pathetic copy of Gran Torino.
I don't care what you're doing,
be it a second, a minute or an hour.
And I see what you're going to do.
And when are you going to do it?
In two minutes you will be even more upset
by the fact that you didn't put the seal on.
You're worried about something.
I thought the first thing I should have taught you, the Almighty,
was never to show anxiety before your enemy.
Those who understand this have clarity of action.
I'm sure you've been taught this countless times,
but you're not able to implement it in practice.
You said I would recognize you,
but I see more and more that I have fewer and fewer reasons for this.
He said I could become one of them!
Gen, an ordinary citizen?
I'm sorry!
You told me not to worry about the room, didn't you?
That's what he said earlier.
I don't care what you're doing,
be it a second, a minute or an hour.
I see what you're going to do.
And when are you going to do it?
He sees what and when I'm doing it.
His words piss me off.
And what does he see?
Just the nearest future?
Or does he see what I'm going to do specifically?
We need to check it.
If this is the second option,
then he won't be able to see the fall of random objects.
Nightingale, I can't give in to you,
because I'm the heir of the Almighty!
There's nothing you can do.
Nothing's changed.
I'm not...
I'm done.
It's all over.
It's not over!
Three minutes have passed.
And you're the heir of the Almighty?
I'm tired of listening to this.
You had one plan, and it didn't work out.
You're exhausted.
It's not that I'm tired.
So you were wrong.
I already wanted to step on the anniversary poster to win.
It can't be.
He was avoiding the symbols of the Almighty,
continuing to act like Gran Tarrino.
Even after all my provocations,
he still thought of his actions against me.
Please forgive us.
Are you done?
The noise is over, and we're in.
I hired him, Mirio.
Hooray!
What? How?
I didn't pass your test!
I told you to print it yourself,
but I didn't say I'd kick you out if you couldn't.
But...
Midoriya, you're great!
Sir, did you smile?
I decided to accept you before you came.
I thought you wouldn't be useless to me,
but I haven't accepted you as a person yet.
Now that the symbol of the world is gone,
people don't just need light, but blinding light.
Let it go against his decision.
I'll show you those who deserve this power,
forcing you to work with the heroes of Profia.
One for all.
It is passed on by the will of the bearer.
He hired me so that I could pass on this power myself.
The Almighty chose me.
And Sir Night Eye cannot do this,
as well as Togata, who was chosen by Night Eye.
I got up in the middle of these strange connections,
and now...
And now I...
It's an honor for me!
You got a job?
That's great, Deku! Cool!
Congratulations, Midoriya!
Thank you.
I'm not going to sit with my hands folded either.
But you're really cool, Midoriya!
Just think, you got a job for Night Eye.
Did Togata help you?
Great job!
I can't tell him that he hired me so that I could give up my job.
You're trying to catch up with us again.
I need to catch up with you as soon as possible.
It's a shame that I can't go to Gunhead.
I want to get a job at Shelke again.
They don't hire students in the Office of the Fourth.
Yeah, the threshold is too high.
We can only go and ask the profs if they want to hire students.
There's nothing we can do.
We take full responsibility, unlike the internships.
The profs don't want to take such responsibility.
Teacher Aizawa?
Profs take a lot of risks when they hire children.
Takayami, by the way, you got an invitation from one of the profs.
From Sokolo and Kyusyo.
Sokolo?
The third rank of heroes?
Wow!
Great job!
What are you going to do, Takayami?
I'll do it with pleasure.
I see.
I'll give you his contract later.
Let me know when you go to Kyusyo.
I'll give you my permission.
That's great, Takayami.
I'm happy.
We need to catch up with him as soon as possible.
Stop talking about it!
By the way, Kirishima, you want to see Amajiki from the Big Three.
Huh?
Why?
Ohada wants to talk to Uraraka and Asue.
Go to them tomorrow and listen to them.
That's all.
Amajiki?
What does he want?
Do you think he wants to invite us to work?
Oh, come on.
I have hope again.
I can't wait.
I'll go to him in the dormitory right now.
Let's go!
Chaka, let's go too.
Let's go too.
Yeah.
Let's catch up with him as soon as possible.
Stop it already!
They're lucky.
We need to try too.
Who cares about this job?
We still can't afford to do a serious job.
Come on, tell me what happened to you at the internship.
I don't even want to remember.
My job will start tomorrow.
Intern.
The next day I started working.
Today we'll be patrolling and watching.
We'll split into two groups.
I'm with Bubble Girl, Amidoriya is with Mirio.
Watching?
We're doing an investigation right now.
We're looking for a group of eight deaths.
A bandit named Chisaki causes strong suspicions.
He started doing strange things.
The plague mask is their trademark.
A scary mask.
But the police is watching these guys.
That's why they're usually obedient.
In the past, the heroes contributed to this.
But Chisaki started building a gang again for something.
We also know that he met with the League of Villains.
However, the details are not clear.
The League of Villains?
And there is no evidence that he is planning a crime.
That's why the hunters are in the blacklist.
We can't consider them villains.
We're looking for evidence of their guilt.
But so that they don't guess anything.
Yes, sir!
I want to hold your hand.
You have a light.
Now you stand alone in the dark.
So that you can't go back.
Now you kill your anxiety and stand in the dark.
It was a lost light.
It was kind, kind love.
But you're still going.
I don't care if there's something missing.
I'm going to look for it now.
I don't need strength.
I don't need anything.
I believe that's all I need.
No matter what kind of pain comes next.
That's all I need to save you.
Come on.
Walk without hesitation.
Someone!
Someone!
Please, someone!
No!
Someone!
At least someone!
I'm sorry.
Are you hurt?
Can you stand?
Are you okay?
She's trembling.
Why?
Look what you've done.
I'm taking you to the hospital.
Let's go home, Eri.
It's started.
This is a preview.
I let go of Eri's hand.
What the Night Eye said.
That there is someone more worthy than anyone else.
Uncertain feelings.
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.
He's more worthy than anyone else.
Uncertain feeling is holding me back.
I'll get the shocking truth from the All-Mighty.
his future that the Night Eye saw.
In the next episode.
Yesterday night above the game.
Are you kidding me?
Then why ...
I don't want this All Mighty!
