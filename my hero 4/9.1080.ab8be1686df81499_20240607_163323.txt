I had to pump you up with poison, he won't kill you, but you won't be able to move for a long time, and your masks will be with me for now, who knows what else can be stored in them.
It took too much time, it turned out that the rest of them could go further. I have to go.
What?
My face.
As if not in time.
I have to go.
Magic
Magic, will everything be fine with him? I can't stop worrying.
Yes.
Even the younger one doesn't believe in him, even though he said he could do it. He looked too uncertain.
But still, when the comrade shows his back, believe in him, because this is how real men act. Senpai can do it.
You changed your opinion so quickly.
I'm still worried, but I can only believe in him. You can't waste a second of time.
You're bending the stick.
Something is wrong. The villain who changed the surroundings of the labyrinth stopped showing himself.
That's true. The walls stopped changing their shape.
If we go further, without encountering obstacles, this may mean that he is in another place and cannot control the entire building.
There is still a group of police there. Maybe he decided to pay attention to them.
Do you want to say that he can follow all the rooms at the same time?
It's just a guess. He went inside to control the walls, but didn't get along with them.
If he moves to watch and listen, then when he changes the physical premises, his real body is probably close.
I can't believe that they could only overcome one of them.
Even though they are abandoned, they have outstanding magic.
If he tries to get in our way, then his eye or ear should come out.
That's right.
Then I can see him.
It's him!
I can't believe you thought you could stop us. You're not friends with the head at all.
Of course we are friends.
Everyone who came out to stop you is in good spirits. We sit peacefully.
The Restorer would have deprived us of this head.
Are you talking about Chisaki?
Yes. He took this name after the boss went to bed and he was in charge.
The boss appreciated the old traditions of the Yakuza.
He was looking for a path that would allow the Yakuza to live in this era.
Unlike the villains, the eight vows must show no mercy.
The boss didn't like it when the eight vows were compared to the villains.
We are here only because of the old boss.
And this one takes the villain's names.
He gathers the villains into a gang, voluntarily makes decisions and does not consider the opinion of the other members of the gang.
This guy does whatever he wants.
And the current state of the old boss is clear.
Even though you hate him, you are sure that he will not be caught.
Yes.
Listen.
Madmen are called those who never think about consequences.
And such people are damn strong.
Wipe your head!
He aimed at me?
He doesn't want me to see him.
Since the three of them couldn't handle it, I'll just get them out of the game.
Fatty!
If he does what he wants, then the time that Tamaki won for us will go to nothing.
Wipe your head!
You have to wipe it!
Sorry.
Why are you here?
I also wanted to save the teacher.
Because I would have been able to withstand the blow, but then you sucked me in.
Well, okay.
Better get ready for a fight.
Fist.
Let him not be offended if he flies into the field.
Red.
Hands.
Do you want to know my opinion?
It's humiliating to use any weapon in a fight.
Anyone who has it can win.
You can't even call it a battle.
It's better to try to kill him.
You can't even call it a battle.
You can't even call it a battle.
It's better to try to kill him.
You can't even call it a battle.
You can't even call it a battle.
You can't even call it a battle.
You can't even call it a battle.
You can't even call it a battle.
What?
Barrier?
What the hell?
Fatty is a boy who can strengthen the body.
Both of them have a trick designed for protection.
What a bother.
Isn't that right, Rappa?
Rappa!
His strikes are moving through the layers of my fat.
Strikes are like bullets.
They were designed for protection, you can't say about them.
Well, I think that's why they're still not turned into minced meat.
I didn't see any of them in the report.
They should be new.
Gun strikes and unbreakable barrier
are a very unpleasant combination.
You're looking for a shield, aren't you?
Hey, wait!
So, there won't be a battle?
What a pity!
However, that boy is unlikely to be good enough for a shield.
My hands are bruised!
It hurts!
I couldn't hold the blow!
One more such blow and I'm done!
And I thought I got stronger!
Damn!
I'm still...
Don't lose your invulnerability!
If your spirit goes down,
then you will definitely lose!
In battles with villains,
the first thing to do is to break their spirits!
Therefore, in the battle of will,
you should never give in to them!
Let's quickly deal with these two!
He's going to beat us.
You're lucky, Rappa.
This fat guy is really cool!
Tengai!
I'm starting to like it!
Take this thing away and don't use it anymore!
I didn't need your barrier at all!
Don't let your desire blind you
and don't forget the orders
given by the Master Recoverer.
Combining our powers,
we can secure victory!
What did you think, dumbass?
The Ripper just gave us
to get rid of this combination!
Not the Ripper, but the Master Recoverer.
I don't care!
All I want is to fight to the death!
Then do what you want.
If you're so confident in your victory.
Do you understand me?
Good job, Ripper!
If I get close to the hit,
I won't be able to dodge his attack.
Moreover, his hits are so strong
that they even break through my trap of absorption.
If it continues like this,
I'm done for.
Even though they made fun of me.
I'm sure this man will put a barrier
if something goes wrong.
It felt like I was hitting an iron wall.
His barrier is too strong
for my hit.
If I don't deal with him,
I can forget about the victory.
And plus,
the Ripper got too much damage.
So there's nothing else left.
If it doesn't work,
we definitely won't get out alive.
Fat Ripper, huh?
You haven't hit me for a long time.
I used to like to fight well, too.
And now, either your hands are out of power,
or I won't be able
to take these hits anymore.
A spear and a shield?
Let's have a real battle,
Ripper!
You really are a cool fat guy!
Tengai, about the barrier...
I don't use it.
Great!
You're so bad today!
Fat...
He's trying to protect me,
even though he knows he won't last long.
What am I doing?
I thought I got stronger,
but my super form,
which I was so proud of,
was just smeared.
And now I'm just getting in the way.
It hurts so much!
And this guy is only
increasing the speed.
What if I can't do it on time?
Don't disappoint me,
Fat Ripper!
Hold on a little longer!
I'm just getting in the way!
What can I do?
What can I do now?
Fat Ripper is going to die!
It's all my fault!
This useless bastard is not capable of anything!
The exercises are over,
and you're not capable of anything anymore!
Are you really not capable of anything?
This boy...
can't go on.
His eyes are filled with fear.
It turns out...
nothing has changed since then.
Nothing at all.
I heard recently that your magic
will turn the leaves into anything.
Change these leaves
into 10,000 copies.
In this month,
we can't create money
and they'll quickly turn back.
So we'll spend them before that.
I can't do it anyway.
Hey!
Are you trying to scare kids for money?
It's not like that!
Who's that?
Rishima, the third grader.
He's lying right here!
It's okay.
He's not that strong.
His magic just slightly strengthens him.
Bastard!
Come with us!
Stop!
Forget about them.
Did you just watch?
He's a brave spirit.
It doesn't matter.
That's what the bravest hero would say.
Al and Buntar.
We've talked a bunch of times.
Forget about this old man.
Profs say that the body moves
before it can think.
In other words...
Oh, this is Ashadamina from the fourth grade.
What are they talking about?
Apparently, they're friends.
They started dancing break.
And went home?
Nothing happened.
What was that?
Mina, here you are.
Don't you want to go shopping?
Let's go.
I heard that she's going to go to the U.A.
She's not very strong.
She has a lot of friends.
She has a good sense of humor
and an attractive appearance.
Today, heroes aren't like they used to be.
Now everything is based on popularity.
Ashada is very popular.
That's why she's perfect for the role of a hero.
If you compare me to her,
my charm is strength
and not the most outstanding.
As a human, I'm boring.
As long as you have a brave spirit,
charms are not important.
That's why I've been training
with my body and soul
to replace what the charm can't do.
At least that's what I thought.
What school are you going to go to?
Can you apply for it too?
Stupid.
There's no place for ordinary people like us.
Let's go to College Doroid together.
Oh, yeah.
I haven't decided yet.
He's so boring.
Every time I see someone like Ashada,
I wonder
if my charm was more interesting.
Would I be able to say
that I want to go to the U.A.
without being ashamed?
What's going on?
It's Springer's Hero's Office.
Where the hell are you?
Can you tell me?
Damn it!
Why isn't there a patrolling hero
right now?
Anyone?
No.
You take care of this.
Why aren't you taking care of this?
You take care of this.
Why aren't you telling me?
I'm going.
Come on!
Go already!
Go through that corner, then turn left
to the main street.
Two kilometers ahead and you're at the office.
Thank you.
All for the Lord.
Damn it!
It was so scary!
Thank you, Mina.
If it wasn't for you,
he would have killed us.
I told him to go to the police station,
so we'd better run.
Why didn't you do anything?
Why?
Sounded especially for the Gym Club.
The group's website is vk.com
slash gymfans.
In the spring,
a middle school student
got into a fight with a powerful villain.
Everyone was talking about him.
But
according to the witnesses,
right before the all-powerful appeared,
there was another student,
presumably his friend.
To fulfill the power of the spirit,
how?
When you're really scared,
when your life is at stake,
your true personality
is revealed.
People who are able
to take a step forward,
faced with a deadly danger,
can become heroes.
I'm not a hero.
Not even a man.
According to my mom,
when my miracle first appeared,
I accidentally scratched my right eye.
After a while,
I hated my miracle.
There was nothing special about it.
But it was the beginning
of my admiration for heroes
who had hated my miracle.
Even with such a miracle,
he risked his life without fear.
That's not true.
I'm sorry.
The group of heroes
that I once asked for a birthday,
that's where
I first heard about him.
Then let's move on to the questions.
Yes, go ahead.
Compared to other heroes,
most people think of you
as if you were breaking your head
and flying forward.
Do you feel fear in front of your face?
Who do you think I am?
Of course, I'm afraid.
Anyone who runs into battle
without fear of death is a complete idiot.
In elementary school,
I didn't really understand
what he was talking about,
and I didn't think about it.
I didn't think about it at all.
When I was still a partner,
there was a time
when I couldn't save anyone.
Yes, you can't do anything about it.
The level of crime is now.
I'm not talking about that.
I doubted myself.
My spirit was weak,
and I couldn't save them.
Villains are terrified of death themselves.
But I know worse things.
The expression of people's faces
before death
and the fact that you couldn't save them.
That's why I'm fighting.
After all, I had to test
these things on myself.
And what is the spirit of courage for you?
It's a moral rod in your soul,
and it doesn't mean
to be fearless or confident in yourself.
I'm a hero, and that's why I save people.
After I made this decision
with all my heart,
it became the reason
why I can die.
Life without regrets.
That's what courage means to me.
Hey, are you serious?
Yes, I'm serious.
I won't let this happen again.
I'm sorry.
That time I saw
how you two got into trouble.
But I was so scared that I couldn't move.
Who are you?
Oh, you're from Class 1, aren't you?
There's nothing like that.
Anyone would be scared.
Mina is just the best.
Hey, what's wrong with your hair?
Did you decide to look like this
in high school?
You've got pimples now, just like mine.
That's right.
And don't be afraid.
I won't feel sorry for anything else.
I'll become a hero
who can protect people.
I say goodbye to myself
who feels sorry for the past.
Are you still mad at yourself
for what happened?
It was hard for you
back then, wasn't it?
I can see that.
Don't torture yourself so much.
Hey, it actually hurts.
What the...
When you completely overcome
yourself from the past,
will you tell me, okay?
And now I'm going to tell everyone
in school that you specifically
changed your hairstyle to senior high school.
Okay.
I've already gone through
a lot of scary things
up to this point,
but I was always afraid of the strongest.
Stop fooling around.
Hold on a little longer.
Did you think I was just a shield?
And now it's going to be
your last mistake.
I swallowed every hit
and now all this power
is stored in my body.
The power consumes a lot of energy
and it burns my protective layer of fat.
The protection gets worse
with every hit,
but the power that I have accumulated
will become a spear that will pierce any shield.
Rappa, he's up to something.
Hurry up and deal with him.
That's what I was thinking,
but he pierced me more than I expected.
I don't have time to release
everything I've accumulated.
I want to see.
Show me that while you're still alive.
Red!
I will never
feel sorry for anything else.
I will
become
a hero who can protect.
He's gotten even stronger
than before.
The moment he pierces you,
strengthen yourself again.
Hold on. Defend.
Sacrifice yourself.
You're just great.
Did you set a barrier?
Of course I did.
Useless tricks.
They just fly away
in front of my barrier.
Useless.
Thank you, my friend.
Thanks to you,
we have a great spear.
Tengai, put the barrier away.
You lost for a different reason.
You underestimated the barrier
to its full power.
It's useless. It will pierce it.
Tengai and I underestimated
the red rebel
and his powerful spirit.
