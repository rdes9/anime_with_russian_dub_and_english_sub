Now 80% of people all over the world have the miracles of their own birth.
To fight the villains who use their own magic to commit crimes, a hero's profession was created.
My name is Midoriya Izuku, and I dream of becoming a hero.
To do this, I entered the UA Academy, where I experienced a lot of events together with everyone.
Recently, I received a temporary license from a professional hero.
Now I have to find an agency for myself, and I was thinking about where I would start my career.
What, an internship? Who the hell are you?
Grant Arina, I wanted to ask you...
I'm sorry, man, I don't have time to pick up your snot. I'm busy with important work.
Oh, right! You were so useless that no one else was interested in you except me.
I plan to stop being useless. I'll do everything to become the number one hero.
The Almighty can introduce you to his friends.
For example, to his former partner, Night Eye.
I'm sorry, man, I don't have time to pick up your snot. I'm busy with important work.
I'm sorry, man, I don't have time to pick up your snot. I'm busy with important work.
I'm sorry, man, I don't have time to pick up your snot. I'm busy with important work.
I'm sorry, man, I don't have time to pick up your snot. I'm busy with important work.
I'm sorry, man, I don't have time to pick up your snot. I'm busy with important work.
I'm sorry, man, I don't have time to pick up your snot. I'm busy with important work.
I'm sorry, man, I don't have time to pick up your snot. I'm busy with important work.
I'm sorry, man, I don't have time to pick up your snot. I'm busy with important work.
I'm sorry, man, I don't have time to pick up your snot. I'm busy with important work.
I'm sorry, man, I don't have time to pick up your snot. I'm busy with important work.
I'm sorry, man, I don't have time to pick up your snot. I'm busy with important work.
I decided to die.
I have a promise in my heart.
Even if it's a cold light,
go!
You're kidding, huh?
It's some kind of dump.
I'm sick of it.
I'm sick of it.
You caught a funny fish, Twice.
Twice?
Funny, you say?
Look at yourself, the face of the villains.
What? Is he famous?
The teacher told me about him.
They call themselves Yakuza.
Eight Sermons of Death.
And he's their leader.
Episode 65. The Restorer.
I thought the leader of the Eight Sermons of Death would be older.
So they're the best gang, number two.
Oh my God, I like him already.
He smells dangerous.
Yakuza? What are they different from us?
Let me explain everything to you.
A long, long time ago, the underworld was ruled by a mass of Buddhist groups.
But then the heroes appeared
and threw these cockroaches out of their homes.
The Almighty finished them off.
Those who survived could no longer influence the current situation.
They were treated as villains.
Simply put, they are ordinary bandits,
the relics of the past.
You can consider them dead animals
and bring them to the Red Book.
So they are dead animals.
It looks like the truth.
So what about the boy from Yakuza?
Did he also decide to leave after the resignation of the Almighty?
No, the Almighty was not a problem.
I'm more interested in the resignation of one of them all.
He was the real emperor of the underworld.
My generation considered him a city legend.
The older generation was insanely afraid of him.
Even after hearing of his death.
But that time he appeared personally.
American!
Destroyer!
The Almighty sent him to rest in Tartar.
In other words,
there is no longer anyone who rules the underworld.
There is no one to be afraid of.
But the question arises, who is the next boss?
If you know who my teacher is,
then why are you asking this stupid question?
Maybe you want to dispute this?
The next boss is me.
Right now I'm gathering an army
and there will be even more of us.
With the help of this force,
I will destroy the heroic community.
And what is your plan?
Plan?
Did you come here
not to join us?
Your goal looks like a dream.
You talk about your childhood dreams
and offer to join?
What are you going to do with your army?
What are you planning to destroy in the first place?
What organization are you going to build?
You had the killer of the heroes, Stein.
And also Muscular and Moonfish.
They were all first-class figures.
You were so careless about them.
Do you even understand how strong they are?
You hardly control the ten crazy people.
What force are you talking about?
What are you going to do with the army
that you cannot control?
To achieve the goal, you need a plan.
And I just have one.
I came here not to join you.
Twice, why didn't you check his intentions?
I need a lot of money to pay for my plan.
Not many people are ready to invest in such a rarity as Yakutza.
But your reputation is pretty good.
Follow me.
I will show you how to control people.
I will become the new boss of the criminal world.
Go away.
Sorry, Yakutza.
We are here not to serve someone.
I recently met an old friend.
He was reserved and shy.
But he is my friend, even knowing who I used to be.
He told me,
chained by common sense,
they always laugh at those who don't have them.
Kim, you are definitely not bound by common sense.
I don't have the courage to break these chains.
I am here because I want to live the way I want.
We will decide what to do.
Mag?
Magne!
Don't even think about it.
He started first.
It's so dirty.
I hate dirt.
Stop, Compress!
This guy is a problem.
I will crush him, and then we will figure it out.
The spell doesn't work.
Don't touch it.
Cover me.
Got it.
We should have started with that.
It would have been easier to understand what you want.
I almost touched you, Restorer.
You are late.
I missed once.
But I had enough time to fix it.
Wait!
Where did you come from?
Nobody was following us.
Probably it's some kind of a miracle.
The situation is too complicated to continue.
I think there is no point in reducing the number of each other.
There is a body on each side.
It's time to stop.
Let's cool our heads and talk another time.
We owe you a hand.
Bastard, I'll kill you!
Can I chop him?
Don't.
Let him answer for it!
Don't.
Good decision, hand.
I'm not in a hurry.
I'm not in a hurry.
I'm not in a hurry.
I'm not in a hurry.
But the sooner, the better.
Think about it.
And our organization and everything else.
Let me know when you calm down.
Stop!
Why are you stopping me, Shigaraki?
Jin, take Tsuchiro to the doctor.
Can you stand up?
My miracle didn't work.
It hurts so much!
Tomura, I'll chop them.
Don't.
Tomura?
Not yet.
You lost again, Tomura.
But don't despair.
Just start over.
Start over as much as you need.
That's why I'm here.
It's all for you.
To achieve the goal, you need a plan.
And I have it.
Eight vows of death.
You will pay for it.
Sounded specifically for Gym Club.
Site groups in VK.com.
Working in an agency is much more responsibility than an internship.
You will have to perform the hero's job in profile directly.
We discussed it with the teachers yesterday at the meeting.
And most of them said yes.
They're all against your internship.
What?
Then why did we get together?
If you think about why we live in the dormitory, it's all logical.
You have to!
You say that because you're self-reliant.
But there are those who believe that with such a policy you won't get strong heroes.
That's why we came to a simple decision.
You will be able to work only in recommended agencies.
I'll probably go to Gunhead again.
I need to call Shelke.
Fuck you!
So I have to choose an agency with a good list.
The Almighty can introduce you to his comrades.
For example, to his former partner.
Do you want me to ask you to take you to Sir Night's Eye?
Yes, please.
He is one of those who worked with you.
He's so energetic.
I want to go to karaoke.
Sir Night's Eye, then?
Where did you learn this name?
I see.
You wanted to work in the agency, and Grant Arina told you where to go.
Please!
Why?
I'm not angry.
There are three reasons for this.
First, I'm one of those who was against your work.
In any case, you shouldn't risk it so much in the first year.
I completely agree.
Shouldn't we support the students' initiative?
Second, you shouldn't go to hell until you work out your fighting technique.
I think he's good enough.
However, he has a place to grow.
It's better to sharpen your skills.
Third, it's Sir Night's Eye.
It's hard for me to talk to him.
Is this your personal problem, Almighty?
Personal! Personal! Personal!
Mike, please, that's enough.
Almighty!
Kachan said he didn't want to lose to me.
My miracle is just like yours, Almighty.
I'm sure Sir Night's Eye will help me become stronger.
I need to become stronger!
Stronger than everyone else!
I understand your impatience.
However, I like your mood, but I still can't introduce you.
In any case, it's me.
Mario Togata, the Almighty is calling for you.
Please follow him to his office.
I repeat.
The Almighty is calling for me?
What does he want?
Hey, Togata, what did you do?
Something indecent again?
What does the Almighty want from you?
I don't know.
But I have to find out.
Something like that.
Isn't that funny?
I'm sorry.
Because...
You're here!
It's a joke.
I'm sorry, I had to say that, because the Almighty himself is here.
I don't understand why it's all this.
What a coincidence!
I don't understand either.
Young Togata is now an intern at Sir Night's Eye.
Is that true, Togata?
Yes, it's been a year, really.
So after graduation you'll be his partner?
If Sir doesn't change his mind, then yes.
Cool!
I won't hold back.
What do you think, young Togata?
Will Midoriya work with Sir Night's Eye?
I see.
That's why they called me.
Do you want me to introduce Midoriya to Sir?
Well...
Why all this meddling?
Sir would be glad to meet you personally.
He's been watching videos with you all the time.
To be honest, I'm ashamed to be in front of him.
After all, my career ended the way he said.
So, what do you say about Midoriya?
We need to think.
What kind of hero do you want to be?
What kind?
He saves everyone with a smile.
Can I be the same?
He's so cool.
I can be a hero, can't I?
I want to save everyone with a smile.
Izuku!
I can't take it anymore!
I want to be strong.
So that no one worries about me.
To always win.
To save everyone.
I want to be the greatest hero!
They say that it's easier to organize thoughts by saying them aloud.
I've been through a lot.
The more I'm worried, the more I understand how difficult this path is.
That's why I need to be stronger.
You have a crazy goal.
I don't see a reason to refuse you.
Really?
Thank you very much.
I was thinking that you would definitely like Seru.
Really?
I just don't know if he'll agree.
Anyway, thank you very much.
I have no doubt that you will find a worthy successor here.
Togo Tamirio, right?
Despite his grades, this student is always on the lookout.
He never smiles.
Even if he has low grades, he never gives up.
This is what you value in heroes, right?
If I hadn't met the young Midoriya, I would have chosen...
And now the weekends have come.
And here are the weekends.
I'm so tired of these trainings and licenses.
I'm so glad I can relax.
It's easier, man.
By the way, these two.
They have extra weekends.
You should say thank you to the teachers.
Even after you fought with Midoriya,
they still allow you to pass the exam.
Shut up already.
We shouldn't back down from the others.
I told you to shut up!
Get lost, you two-faced!
We're going to practice with Yau and Rose.
Are you coming with us?
Sorry, I'm busy today.
What would you like to see today?
Well, everyone has their own.
It's time to go to the U.A.
This is Sarah's agency.
Hey, relax, man.
Everything's fine.
I forgot to tell you.
Sarah has very strict rules.
I know that.
He's famous for his quality.
He's strict not only to others, but to himself.
Even through the TV screen.
I can't take my eyes off him.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, he's like that.
But Sarah has a quality
that he doesn't show to others.
If you don't want to be kicked out,
you have to,
before the end of your first conversation,
make him laugh at least once.
What do you mean, make him laugh?
How?
Despite his gloomy look,
Sarah really appreciates humor.
I can only introduce you to him.
But Sarah will decide
whether to accept you or not.
I want to help you.
But it all depends on you.
You have to find out yourself
what quality Sarah needs.
I know it's too late to ask,
but why are you doing me such a favor?
It's not a favor at all, to be honest.
But you want to make your crazy dream come true.
And to help those who ask for help
is the essence of heroes, right?
He's right behind this door.
If you want to get stronger,
open this door yourself.
Okay.
So, let's see.
We found out the meeting place.
There we found traces of blood.
And given the damage of the complex,
the meeting ended with a fight
between two gangs.
Most likely, League of Criminals...
Bubble Girl.
I don't think there's a future
without energy and humor for society.
What?
Well, it's just...
The report is too long.
I just forgot.
Wait, don't!
Please!
I brought the first year
I was talking about yesterday.
Officer Night Eye.
What the...
What the hell is going on here?
Well, it's a whole different story.
Wait, please, stop!
What's going on?
It seems that Bubble Girl
forgot to joke as usual.
So, here he is.
The partner of the Almighty.
Officer Night Eye.
What a tense look.
If you don't go,
I'll kill you.
I have to become stronger.
My egoism brought me here.
From this moment on,
I have to open the doors myself.
Humor, huh?
I can do it.
I'll become the number one hero!
My name is Midoriya Izuku.
I respect the Almighty so much
that I turn his mime into a crime scene.
I respect the Almighty so much
that I turn his mime into a crime scene.
I respect the Almighty so much
that I turn his mime into a crime scene.
I don't know how to make people laugh
if it doesn't make him laugh.
You...
You're making the Almighty laugh?
It's...
It's not funny.
It's...
It's not funny.

clearer
This is the most flourishing in the world now,
I came to join the office of the night-watchman.
My first acquaintance turned out to be unsuccessful, but I will not give up.
Here I will learn a lot and become a real hero.
Is that something?
I was not prepared for this!
In the next episode, the boy meets...
Will it be my destiny?
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
