The festival will start tomorrow.
The hall will close soon. Let's check everything again and rehearse.
Let's start! One, two, three! One, two, three!
Stand up!
Now Aoyama to the center! Midoriya, run for the stage!
Yeah.
Midoriya, you need more determination when you move. Think about how you move. I got it!
Before we started rehearsing, I thought we were going to look very bad.
But the musicians and dancers look pretty cool.
I didn't think that Ashida would be able to teach them something.
And it's true. She's probably so serious because she loves to dance.
Let's show Yue how murderous our music is!
Those words were inspired not only by the musicians.
I'm so worried.
Don't come up with anything during the performance.
Otherwise, people won't understand.
It's a shame.
Kaminari, it's not just about you.
After that, Midoriya runs for the stage.
And then, with the help of a rope, she lifts Aoyama up.
That's it. Good.
It's already 9 p.m.
Students are allowed to stay here until 9 p.m.
Damn it. Let's go home.
After the rehearsal, we go to bed.
And the school festival starts at 9 a.m.
And then, we go to bed.
And the school festival starts at 9 a.m.
And the school festival starts at 9 a.m.
And the school festival starts at 9 a.m.
And the school festival starts at 9 a.m.
And the school festival starts at 9 a.m.
And the school festival starts at 9 a.m.
And the school festival starts at 9 a.m.
And the school festival starts at 9 a.m.
The end
I can't sleep!
I'm so worried!
Come on, Tisha, someone's already asleep.
I wonder if people will like our performance.
It's better not to think about it.
It will be bad if you are embarrassed or nervous.
If you get on stage, you have to have fun.
But you were embarrassed more than anyone!
After your words, don't do this.
It's not going to be cool at all, is it?
It's completely different.
The words of Jiro concern not only performances.
Yes!
When you think about someone else, you help yourself at the same time.
I see.
The rope is too loose.
Wow!
I think we overdid it during the rehearsal.
This is no other than proof of our friendship.
Wait, no, it's dangerous.
I'm sorry, I didn't think about it.
Why don't you ask Jiro to do another one?
Momo is already asleep.
You can't use it as a tool.
But I'm being used as a charger.
They just look at you from above.
Tomorrow morning I'll run after the new rope.
I didn't notice that it was spoiled.
I have training.
And besides, I need to buy something else.
Wait, but our performance starts at 10 a.m.
Many stores are closed until 9 a.m.
In 15 minutes from Yue there is a store of household appliances.
It opens at 8 a.m.
It's very close.
Well, now you can go and sleep.
Yes.
So, tomorrow we will most likely do this, but...
Night owls!
It may not be the time now.
But let's try our best.
Yes!
Here comes the day of the school festival.
A long full coverage of 8%.
Then, at the moment of the blow, you need to increase the power to 20.
I knew you'd be here, Midoriya.
Hatsume, you're all dirty.
I didn't sleep and got dirty.
But I knew you'd be here even on the day of the festival.
I finished your new equipment and decided to bring it to you.
Wow, cool!
Thank you, but you could have done it after the festival.
When it's over, I'll go to sleep for 36 hours.
Can I see?
Yes, of course.
The device that would add 30% to my power was too big.
Now everything is so small.
Can you make it into a pact?
I tried to make them fit the other costumes.
A good inventor should be able to meet the needs of the client.
I'm so glad. Thank you very much.
With their help, I can do everything I dreamed of.
By the way, here's the instruction. Bye.
Thank you, Hatsume!
Let's hurry up and try them on.
Yes!
Damn it! I got used to it for a long time.
That's why the practice ended later.
I thought I could buy everything in one place,
but I had to run to find everything I needed.
I spent a lot of time. I need to hurry up.
I also bought a rope.
I need to go back.
Damn it!
Sorry.
Be careful.
You almost ruined the wonderful aftertaste of the Imperial Golden Tip.
He scared me.
Oh my God.
It can't be.
We had to avoid meeting other people.
Well, let's go, dear.
Dear?
That's right, I'm dear.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
That's right, I'm dear.
Golden Tips.
That's right, I made it for us.
What? Is this a house?
Is this a cafe or something like that?
You can't say that.
Great-hearted?
If you don't know the taste of the Imperial Golden Tips,
then you wouldn't think that...
Maybe you're the one who understands everything.
That's great, because you're so young.
Well, it's not that I know something.
I just remembered that my friend made this tea.
I think I've already heard his voice.
Wow, you have a friend from a higher society.
A friend from a higher society?
An elite school.
You have a good friend.
Damn it.
Yeah, I'm lucky.
I'm blessed.
Wait a minute.
Great.
A child from Yue.
That voice...
Tea.
She said it was a pretty rare tea.
Really?
Thank you, Yao Rose.
And after work.
I always choose tea,
the brand of which is equal to work.
In the next video,
which I will post,
the alarm will sound not only for you,
but also for all people.
Well, we'll go.
It can't be.
I was distracted by the tea.
It's impossible.
He didn't understand anything yet.
Wait a minute, please.
For you,
it's like a ritual.
Don't blame yourself, generous.
There's nothing to do.
Because...
It's too late.
And so,
if suddenly the alarm sounds,
even if it's fake,
we will have to cancel the event
and urgently evacuate everyone.
Ritual?
What are you talking about?
I saw your video.
So...
La Brava, start shooting.
It's time to stop you.
There are many different people
who work hard,
so I wonder what will come of it.
Please, stop.
Don't you dare come near my school!
Don't you dare come near my school!
You're pretty suspicious, young man.
I think it's this boy.
It's Saturday morning.
There are almost no people.
There are no heroic agencies near her either.
I won't wait here for help.
I need to ask someone to call the police.
No.
La Brava, change the plan.
Whatever happens,
don't turn off the camera.
Of course, generous.
But, but...
I think it's a good idea.
Dear viewers,
now you will see
the beginning of a person's adventure
with amazing abilities.
Being blind,
don't take your eyes away.
I am a thief gentleman
who is going to save the world.
A great criminal.
My plans have changed.
This time I will be brief.
Today
I will enter the UAE.
He thinks it's easy.
I won't let you.
I created this obstacle
when I took off my coat.
If you watched my videos,
you should know.
My magic is flexibility.
I give flexibility to everything
I touch.
Even the air.
A great ricochet.
I don't like violence.
Your violence is so gentle,
generous.
I am in confusion.
At the same time, I am surprised,
La Brava.
Here it is.
Power and speed are amazing.
And he appeared out of nowhere.
I'm sorry, young man.
I will win anyway.
If you want to apologize,
then don't dare to attack my school.
I can't do that.
Trampoline.
Being a schoolboy,
I also participated in all events.
I'm sure you have sacrificed a lot of strength.
But nothing
can beat my ears and soul.
After the implementation of my plan,
I will become a legend.
So don't interfere.
Goodbye.
The light of youth.
I remembered.
This boy, Midori Eizuku,
he broke his arms during the sports festival.
He's crazy.
Madness.
I shouldn't have met him.
He hasn't warmed up yet.
You need to finish what you started.
Dear viewers,
I will try to get into the UA.
Now nothing else
but a battle with time.
Sorry, the break is almost over.
I need to go.
I'm also looking forward to your performance.
Deku,
are you leaving already?
Sorry, I need to train.
When Midori
successfully performs,
we can all walk together.
Deku,
Rumelion,
I...
I can't wait.
I'm sure you have sacrificed a lot of strength.
But nothing
but my ears and soul.
Midori,
sometimes you write a lot of things in your notebook.
But what exactly are you writing?
Jiro, do you have an idol
that you want to know everything about?
No, I'm just curious
how your recordings look like.
I want to understand how to mark important notes.
But there are too many of them,
so I can't do it right.
Advice for musicians?
You wrote it all yourself?
People thought the same.
You know, since no one
considers my hobby to be useless,
I kind of lit up
and wrote a lot of things.
Takayami,
hey, bird-head,
I asked you to make the notes more understandable.
You won't impress anyone
with such terrible rhythms.
Got it?
Takayami, the third lesson.
Great criminal!
I have to stop him.
Is it still hard for you
to shoot without stopping or moving?
To land.
Calm down.
I'll miss if I panic.
I have to stop him.
I have to make them both land.
No, Midori,
how many times have I told you?
Focus on the movement
when you do it.
Do you want to aim well
with strong pressure?
Yes, for example, in the city,
so as not to destroy the neighboring houses.
The more options, the better.
Now!
Delaver blow!
Air force!
Air cannon?
Like this!
But this is not enough
to stop me.
Just don't stop me!
Guys, we'll see!
Shut up!
I'm sorry.
Great criminal!
It stinks with discomfort.
Don't worry.
We're just shooting something.
Can you pass it to the neighbors?
I hope it will help us
to win some time, great criminal.
It's hard to admit,
but he has already failed.
You should step back.
Thank you, Hatsume.
I see.
So now you can shoot
at a wide angle.
I don't know how much it will help,
but with the help of my children
you can shoot like a gun.
You practiced clicking your fingers,
like your steel sole.
Will it ever help you get stronger?
Like this!
Thank you, Hatsume.
It's all thanks to
my additional training.
Where is he?
That's right.
It's an unexpected situation.
But I won't lose my self-control.
How can you be so calm?
I will definitely fulfill my plan.
That's all I have.
Gentlemen, I have to go.
Bye.
He doesn't have the right to lose his self-control.
That's right.
It doesn't look like he wants to give up.
That's right. I'm a great criminal.
You're not a gentleman.
You're going to do something to U.A.
What are you up to?
What am I up to?
What channel?
Where can I watch the finished video?
Please, don't compare me
with these scoundrels from the evil league.
Great.
My favorite great.
I'm not going to
kidnap anyone or destroy anything.
I just want to get
into your school festival.
That's all.
Please.
Don't lose.
Let me go, young man.
He's asking for mercy.
You know we're in an emergency situation.
Even if you get there
and someone finds you,
the alarm will be turned off.
The festival will be canceled
and you have nowhere to hide.
So give up.
I'll be fine if that happens.
My partner can turn off the protection system
without any problems.
The festival won't be canceled.
Our plan may be successful.
Everyone will be victorious.
That's a bigger problem.
That's right.
His argument was rejected.
That's my plan.
I would like to continue my way
until it gets too bad.
I've already called the police
until they and the heroes come.
I'm going to keep you here.
Come on, give up already.
We will never agree
until I still feel
the aftertaste of the tea.
I have to ask you not to interfere,
UA student.
We need to predict his movements.
I can't.
I can't.
I can't understand what he's doing.
What's going on?
He's...
If you use air bullets,
I'll repel them with air membranes.
You're so generous.
I'm sorry, but you have to step back.
No, Labrava.
Not yet.
We need to catch him.
You have to listen to me carefully.
I can cancel the effect
of my own wish.
Things return to their original position
gradually.
The steel beams become harder,
but at the same time I keep my elasticity.
And the one I'm standing on
is not fixed at all.
What?
At this rate, this beam will fall.
And it's dangerous.
What's shaking there?
You're a student of UA.
That's why you're going to do
everything possible
to keep this beam from falling.
You wanted to drop it
on that man down there?
No, I just wanted to distract you.
I was planning to do
so that it would return to its original position
and no one would get hurt.
That's scary.
I thought you'd jump after it,
but it looks like you have the power
and speed of a real fighter.
I don't want to say that,
but please stay here
and just wait patiently.
I'm sure someone will notice you,
and by that point I'll do everything.
Let's go, Lobrava.
That's cruel, great man.
You don't play by the rules.
My partner can turn off the defense system
without any problems.
I'll get into the festival.
No, you can't let him go.
It's going to start soon.
Silence and calm.
Calm down, Kaminari.
Silence and calm.
By the way, Bakugo,
put on your T-shirt.
We didn't do it in vain.
The dance costumes are great too.
We just changed the costumes a little.
It's going to bend a lot.
Let it be so.
Midori is nowhere to be found.
He ran away to buy a rope.
It's almost the beginning.
Where is he?
I don't know.
But if they are really on guard,
and I still get there,
it will be even better.
I will become known as a man
who has done a great deed.
He's not lagging behind.
Now one of you
has to give up.
Cut it out.
My miracle.
The end.
The end.
The end.
The end.
The end.
The end.
The end.
The end.
The end.
The end.
The end.
The end.
The end.
The end.
The end.
The end.
The end.
The end.
The end.
The end.
The end.
The end.
The end.
The end.
The end.
The end.
The end.
The end.
