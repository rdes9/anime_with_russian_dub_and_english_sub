        <pre>The 5th match, Aoyama vs. Uraraki vs. the 13th, and this is not the end.
We were so close!
As if I would let you go so easily!
Everything is very bad, we are in a trap!
Think, think how to get out of here!
Think!
To make Deku in my place!
Hey!
Hold on, I'm right now!
Did you think about making Midoriya in your place?
Do you like him?
You shouldn't set yourself up for the enemy.
You need to build it for yourself.
What?
What?
Feud?
And caught!
What I learned from Gunhead was not forgotten.
Coincidentally, now!
I opened my nose!

here and below!
Uraraki hit an Butler tick!
Let's go!
Let's go, Uraraki!
All right!
A helluva job, Uraraki!
I never thought there would be such valid divine move!
Kiroâ€¦
Kero, I think Uraraka just let it all out on her own.
Do you think so?
Well, yeah.
She was talking about something with Aoyama before she shook her hands.
Who knows?
We couldn't hear them talking.
Oh!
Did Uraraka make it?
I didn't expect less from her.
You and Yaoyurozu are great, too.
Kero!
Thank you, Midoriya.
I wonder who's next.
The sixth match is between Ashida and Kaminari.
They're going to fight against Nezo.
The director?
I wonder what kind of shot he's got.
We'll see.
Yeah.
Kaminari and Ashida's team is the practical part.
Get ready, get set, go!
Kaminari, what's our plan?
Run, of course.
Even if the director finds us, I'll take care of him with electricity.
Ashida, you're not supposed to use the spell.
It'll be bad if we melt it.
Yeah, you're right.
What's that sound?
It's not the director, is it?
Run!
Kaminari, what's going on here?
I don't know, but the director is clearly somewhere in the back.
Yeah.
Is he controlling the cranes?
But how did he attack them?
He's so far from them.
It's all thanks to his prediction.
Prediction?
Yeah, moreover, his prediction is based on calculations.
The reaction depends on where my blow will go.
It's as simple as drinking a cup of tea.
Didn't you notice?
That the path to the retreat has been blocked.
The villains with developed intellect are just watching the action.
Director Nezu, the miracle of the developed intellect.
He's an animal whose miracle makes him smarter than any other human.
He's unique and you can't find anyone else like him.
A lot of people have experimented on him.
So now he allows himself to take a walk.
Kaminari, can your electricity be of any help?
I don't know where he is, so I can't waste my charges.
Do you need a ballast?
We need to run now.
But where's the exit?
Maybe there.
Oh, come on.
Is he going to bury us alive?
There's still an exit.
Use your head, think, use your brains.
Kaminari, come here.
Yes.
We need to find the way around.
But if we go the other way...
He's one step ahead.
They can't attack without knowing his location.
He has no plans.
It turns out that they won't be able to handle the time.
And...
Kaminari and Ashida's team doesn't make it.
Damn!
I left you one way to retreat.
Too bad.
Kaminari, Ashida.
They didn't even have a chance to attack.
They must be disappointed.
What? Mina's team lost?
Yes, the director's strategy was perfect.
Really?
That's super cool.
Uraraka, congratulations on your task.
Yes, and congratulations to you, too, Ida.
And Chako, when you fought against 13th,
what were you talking about with Aoyama?
Oh, we were talking about...
Do you like him?
No, it's nothing. It's nothing.
How are you, Uraraka?
You're blushing. Are you sick?
Something happened, Chako.
Koda and Jiro's team. Practical part.
Get ready.
We need to avoid clashes with the teachers and try to escape.
What's your plan?
Okay, let's go.
Practical part of the students face the teachers.
It's the most difficult test.
Yes.
Jiro and Koda's position is not so bad.
Present Mik is fighting against them.
Both of them have a sound-related miracle.
What will they do with the miracle of a similar sound?
Damn, hurry up and let's finish quickly.
I don't like to be uninitiated.
Yeah!
It's so loud!
Koda, you can control the animals, right?
You can make the bird attack them.
Even if I wanted to, the teacher's voice would make them run away.
My ears hurt from him, and the plugs won't help.
He's not just better.
He's on a completely different level.
I can't even get close to him.
Even if we reduce the distance,
should we put on handcuffs and run?
Most likely he's standing opposite the brother,
and we'll have to fight him.
Let's hurry up.
Come out!
My ears!
When will you come out?
I can't take it anymore, I...
My ears!
Present week.
Miracle voice.
He can speak at a great volume
by going from bass to falsetto.
When he first screamed,
his parents took him to a hospital
with an ear bleeding.
The device on his neck is a speaker.
Hurry up!
Damn it!
If he continues, I'll die.
What do we do?
An ant?
Koda, can you control the bugs?
There was a bug here, a little ant.
Is he not getting along with the bugs?
And here you are!
Everything is very bad.
Now...
Equipment!
Someone is faking it.
Do you have a plan?
Yes.
Do you have a plan?
What do we do?
You're already here?
We have to shut him down somehow.
Otherwise we won't get close to him.
Is this a joke?
Koda!
Koda, can you control the insects or not?
Yes, I can.
Well, then...
I'm sorry, I know they're scaring you, but...
Hey!
He's very strong!
My thoughts are confused!
If we turn this around, we can win!
You can do it!
You want to become a hero, don't you?
If so, do it!
Oh, Jiro!
My ears!
Because I just ran away, Jiro!
Jiro!
You got into UAE?
Your mom is so happy!
Kodji, you're so great!
Yes, I got into the school of my dreams, UAE!
UAE, where we always move forward!
Yes, my heart should always be filled with plus ultra!
Oh, kids!
You just have to knock out that grumpy guy!
You can talk to them!
Listen to me!
Do they want to sit back until the end of the fight?
Do they want to sit back until the end of the fight?
They're running from the underground,
where the sound almost doesn't spread!
That's why I hate forests!
It's hard even for a pro.
Koda, that's mean!
That's mean!
It's so sad to be defeated by bugs!
Koda and Jiro's team has passed!
Sounded with the support of Jump Club,
VK.com.
and SlashGemFans.
And subscribe to the channel on Twitch,
twitch.tv, SlashGemClub.
Kodji, we're completely immobile!
Calm down, we just retreated.
It seems that the escape will cost us
titanic efforts.
The only plus is that
his movements are backed by the load.
Let's see who's better at playing hide-and-seek.
Smoke grenade?
It reduces our field of vision.
But it can also play a prank on him.
I can feel your presence.
Are you okay, Hagakure?
Hagakure?
So that's what she was thinking.
Do you want to break through?
Isn't it too easy?
You gave up.
Caught you!
When did you manage?
Vibrated.
Teacher!
You got it wrong!
I'm just at the limit of concentration!
I didn't want to!
Hagakure and Shouji's team has passed.
As expected, Hagakure is perfect
for stealth missions.
Shouji also helped
by taking the whole hit on himself.
Yeah.
Mineta and Sarah's team
is almost done.
Get ready!
Go!
Deku, you're next, right?
Aren't you going to the test zone?
No, I'm going.
But I want to watch the match.
It won't be too much to learn
more about other people's pranks.
And looking at them,
I'm full of confidence.
Everyone is just incredible.
If they don't pass,
it's impossible to fight till the end.
They're incredible.
These UA students never give up.
Yeah.
Well...
There's one who always gives up.
Mineta?
Damn, how can I pass this test?
It's some kind of crap.
It's a complete scam.
How can I pass this insolent test?
But I was waiting
for the trip to the camp.
Why is he running away?
If he runs far away,
it will be very difficult for him.
In this practical exam,
the almighty Mik Cementos
and Full Night are especially strong.
Depending on the person,
it's difficult to imagine
the feeling of complete defeat.
Full Night is a miracle of Lunatic.
It can make people sleep
with the smell
coming from her body.
And it works better on guys.
It works, it works.
It's a grape,
the gate is on the other side.
Sarah, damn it!
I won't forgive you!
Why is he crying?
Because he's jealous of Sarah?
Sarah, damn you!
Watch out!
Mineta, don't come close!
Cessandres!
And...
Knees!
If Sarah didn't save me,
I would be in his place now!
Mineta...
It should be difficult for a child
to survive in such a place.
What do you mean?
U.A. has prepared
many obstacles
and makes students overcome them.
In order for students
to continue to grow
they need to set a goal.
Climbing a mountain
with a sense of uncertainty
is very difficult,
but it is necessary
to become a hero.
Even if students become heroes,
people who don't achieve their goals
don't have a future.
In the end, there is a goal
that the child's heart has aimed at.
I want to date a girl!
I want to be popular with them!
He's motivated!
What the hell?
Why does only my exam
look like Balagan?
Only one breath and you will fall asleep!
Damn!
Mineta,
did you enter the U.A.
to become a hero?
Shut up!
What's wrong with that?
What's wrong with that?
What's wrong with that?
What? Really?
That's great!
Really? Do you want to go with me?
Yes, of course!
I want to be popular with girls.
That's why I became a hero.
I thought I would become popular
when I became a hero.
I thought I would become popular.
I thought I would stand at the gate
until the end of the exam.
But something unexpected happened.
If someone drinks and
runs away from me,
my sadistic side
takes over and I can't stop.
Here they are!
The eyes of the predator
who noticed his victim!
She's just playing with me!
That's right, one dies
and the other dies.
I can't stop!
That's right, one dies and you fall asleep.
Just one breath and
everything will be over.
What can you do?
That's right!
You'll just run away!
Not at all!
After entering the school
I realized that they were cool
not because of their hero status.
They became heroes
because they were cool!
That's right, Midoriya!
How long do you plan
to hold your breath?
It's not like that.
I'm not a fan of
such treacherous heroes like you.
I ran away from the gate
and woke up
your sadistic nature
to bring you here.
I did all this
to be cool!
Do you want to say
that I'm in your trap?
Everything is going as it should.
I won't let you!
Your smell won't work on me!
Lenta Seru?
Can you fight in such a state?
There is no need in the battle!
My special techniques
have already begun to work!
Grapefruit rain!
You're pretty good!
He took her away from the gate
so that his spell
wouldn't work on him.
He's a funny guy.
He made me a fool.
If you think so
then wishing for the glory
of women's attention
is also a kind of goal.
Damn!
If you don't try to save me
then I'll have to figure it out myself.
Which time does the chest save
the day?
Seru's team has passed.
Great, they've passed!
Mineta's plan worked!
Your deck!
Mineta, congratulations!
I want to become a great hero too!
I won't lose to anyone in this class!
Midori and Bakuk's team!
