        <pre>I was still trying to use my magic.
Only when I needed it.
I imagine the warmth spreading all over my body.
Do you want to try?
Yes, of course!
I never said that!
Regret is also an inevitable, inevitable future
That's why it's red
A mirage
A mirage
A mirage
A mirage
A mirage
A mirage
To the future, to the future
To the future, to the future
To the future, to the future
To the future, to the future
To the future, to the future
To the future, to the future
To the future, to the future
God rest his soul
to be completely covered with wonder
if you move
your odds will multiply
Well, what are you going to do?
Let's start with three minutes.
Three minutes?
You have to hit me at least once.
Damn, he's back.
You're pathetic. If you can't sleep with me,
you can forget about saving others.
The future symbol of the world
has to overcome this obstacle.
One for all.
I'll have to activate the spell again.
One hit won't break me,
but its speed is beyond my perception.
I just need to get out of here.
I don't have much time.
Come on!
Don't be stupid.
I can see you.
You can't win in this way.
Now!
You wanted me to stop?
You caught me.
One for all.
Full cover.
Oh, almost.
Just like last time.
Hit!
It broke.
Time's up.
Damn.
I have to keep training.
I still have a lot to do.
No.
You managed to attack me
when I was defenseless,
just analyzing the situation.
It's a familiar state for you.
During this day, you became much stronger.
And for the first time in a long time
made me turn serious.
And this guy will become monstrously strong.
Your abilities have significantly improved.
Let's continue.
Yes, let's continue.
But before that,
I would like to have breakfast.
I completely forgot about it.
Well, let's warm up the taikas again.
They all fell.
I'll run after them.
But now I clearly see my goal.
One for all.
Full cover.
I completely mastered this miracle.
Episode 28. Midoriya and Shigaraki.
Concentrate on the strike.
Don't think about it. Just hit.
Your physical training is very important here.
Yes.
He has such a sweet talk.
He's a little warm.
You can't even brew a stone, can you?
Clients must come to the perfect office.
What are you going to do
if you can't serve them?
I'm sorry, Mr. Fourth Son.
Oh, my God.
It's so nice to play you.
Always welcome.
Thank you for the science.
You must calm down the people
you have to save.
You must be competent.
Your appearance, speech, action.
All this must be elegant.
Did you understand everything?
In other words,
something like that.
Yes.
Top jeans.
I think I'm not in that area.
After this photo session,
we need to visit some kind of radio broadcast
and give an interview for a fashion magazine.
We're just her fans.
I think this is also part of the heroic profession.
I think it's necessary.
She has something to learn.
I'm sure.
Maybe.
She doesn't want to realize it.
I'm sorry to distract you, Almighty.
Yeah, it's okay, Sukauchi-kun.
Well, what did you find out?
Among those who took part in the attack on the USG,
there was a villain whom you sent on a flight.
Well, I think so.
Oh, there's a big guy here, huh?
We did a DNA test.
DNA test?
Yes.
We don't ask you to participate in the investigation,
but I have some interesting information
and I have to share it with you.
It's connected to the repeater.
After many tests,
we realized that the problem was not
that he doesn't know how to speak.
He didn't react to our actions.
He is not able to act on his own.
As for his personality,
we found out that he was a simple criminal.
And how is all this connected to the repeater?
Listen carefully.
Based on the results of the test,
I can say that the genes of four different people
are mixed in it.
Genes of four different people?
Is he even a human?
His body was changed
under the influence of strong drugs and drugs.
Roughly speaking,
his body was modified
in order to accept four miracles.
The lack of brain activity
is connected to his current state of mind,
but we are more concerned about his DNA.
And where did he get so many miracles?
Even if you combine several DNAs,
until they come together,
the repeater will not be able
to use the received miracles.
You know it yourself
since you received one of them for everyone.
It is very likely that there is someone else
who can transmit miracles.
Just don't tell me!
I have all the reasons
to consider it true.
That's why I came to you.
This man has begun to act again.
That man...
Do you want me to become your ally?
No matter what you want to achieve,
you must be able to achieve it.
And if you are weak,
then no one will claim your place
at the dumpster.
This is a natural course of action.
That is why we have what we have.
Yes, everything is so complicated.
Kurogiri,
send this guy back.
I am paralyzed.
This must be a miracle killer of the heroes.
The society is overflowing with fakes
and the true meaning of this word
has drowned in these beautiful wrappings.
And the villains,
who clearly bend the stick,
it's time to point to their place.
Wait a second.
It's not like that.
I will kill you.
You are too much of a coward.
You are too much of a stubborn person.
You are too much of a stubborn person.
I am so high-handed.
And if I had to say
who I would kill,
yes,
it would be the Almighty.
I think I am a stubborn person.
I want to kill everyone in this cursed city.
Where do they get such scams?
I am a man of my word.
I am a man of my words.
My wounds are almost healed.
There is no doctor in our team.
Will you take this job?
I finally understood who you are.
Our goals do not match.
However,
we both want to interfere
in the measured course of reality.
Enough already.
Get out of here and die.
I am already one of those who you hate so much.
I just felt you.
Human nature
only appears in front of death.
It's different here.
There is a desire,
a perverted perception
that you have grown in yourself.
How will this evil button dissolve?
It will not be difficult for me
to let you go to waste.
You want to get rid of me?
He is leaving.
Kurogiri,
I do not need such a crazy companion anymore.
I do not like this.
Shigaraki Tomura,
he is important to us.
His strength should be useful to us.
The negotiations were successful.
I have nothing to do here.
So, return me to Hoso.
I have unfinished business there.
Well,
the whole city is on our ears.
We are the villains,
we can not stick our noses out.
How to know?
The killer of the heroes.
I managed to gather
a little information.
He appeared in seven different places
and wounded four heroes.
I do not know
whether he did it intentionally
or intuitively,
but he acts in Hoso.
And Tensei was the first.
Forgive me,
Tenya.
There is a great chance
that he will appear in the city again.
Come on,
I'll kill you myself.
The day of practice.
I support five percent coverage
and attack.
Let's take a break.
If you continue to fight against me,
it can turn out to be strange.
I have no tactics now.
I have to master the magic.
Let's continue the sparring.
No, that was enough.
Put on your shirt.
It's time for the second phase of our internship.
What?
In short,
let's go fight the evil.
What? So fast?
If you fight only with me,
in the future you may have problems
with other opponents.
During the second phase,
you will get experience in fighting
with different enemies and in different situations.
This is still an internship.
You just have to fight the villains.
You certainly say the right things,
but you have to prepare.
You already have experience in fighting
against villains.
We will not touch the big fish.
Let's go on a tour.
Due to the low density of the population,
the level of crime here is low.
Heroic agencies open
in densely populated areas
where the level of crime is higher.
The more people, the more problems.
There are always clashes in Shibuya.
It's okay.
Did you mean Tokyo?
I didn't think I'd have to wear
a suit in such a big city.
You couldn't wear it there
without escorting the hero.
You should be glad that you can get into it.
In general,
are we going straight to Senjuku?
Yes.
We will be passing Hoshio.
I wonder how Ida is doing.
I'll try to contact him later.
Today we will be patrolling Kyoto.
Sorry, it's very monotonous.
No, it's okay.
That's even better.
Hey.
It's not convenient to ask, but still.
You're pursuing the killer of the heroes, right?
That's...
That's the only reason
why you could choose my office.
But I'm glad you came to us.
You shouldn't concentrate
on hatred.
We don't have the right
to commit suicide.
The use of magic
is limited by the law.
That's why
regardless of the reason,
heroes can't use magic
for their own personal purposes.
If someone uses magic
for personal purposes,
it will be regarded as a serious crime.
I don't want to say
that the killer of the heroes is innocent.
You just seemed to me so grumpy
and constantly focused on one thing.
That's why I was worried.
Thank you for the warning.
Come on, I'm glad you understood everything.
Let's go.
But...
But then...
What should I do
with what I feel?
Koso looks better
than I thought.
So what are you going to do?
I'm going to change this city.
And in order to do that,
I need even more victims.
Is this your unfinished business?
It looks like
you're one of the incomprehensible.
What do you have against it?
The title of the hero
should only be worthy.
And now there are too many of them.
Damn capitalist pigs.
And until the world
realizes its mistake,
I will appear
again and again.
How did he get me?
It's time for him
to make his quote.
Someday he will beat me to a pulp.
I would not joke with him.
The point is that in the cities
where he was,
there is a decline in crime.
One analyst said
that it was all thanks to the heroes
who began to work harder.
That's great.
The heroes are working hard
to defend their piece of bread.
So the killer of the heroes
can be called the scourger
of the native heroes.
Something's wrong with him.
We are not on the same path.
And he is not a hero.
He is not a hero.
I am not on the same path.
And he annoys me.
Kurogiri, release Nomu.
Do you think I will let you go?
If I wanted,
you would already be.
It will be an unequal battle.
I will take everything
and I will not return anything.
We will come only at night.
Are you sure?
Of course.
We will have fun
on the streets at night.
It sounds dangerous,
but I have to agree with you.
Are you sitting in your telephones again?
Like all children in our time.
He read the message,
but did not answer.
They always answer
within three minutes.
We are almost at the Kosovo station.
If something happens,
let us know.
We are friends, right?
Yes.
Hey, look!
That building just exploded!
Where?
Something exploded.
We ask all passengers to take their seats.
What?
What's going on?
Hero?
Nomu!
Sit down, kid!
GranTarino!
GranTarino!
What is it?
What's going on here?
That's great!
Let's make a salute.
What did you say?
A villain has appeared?
Got it, we are moving out.
No, we need to run.
But don't tell anyone
that we are here.
No, we need to run.
But don't tell anyone.
No, it's not his handwriting.
He's trying not to attract attention to himself.
It's so noisy.
These idiots have already started to make noise.
I'll deal with them later.
And now
I have to do one dirty job.
My body
doesn't move.
You freak!
Die!
If you were a hero
then choose carefully
your last words.
A kid in a suit.
Who's there?
Go away.
This is not a good place for a schoolboy.
A ball in a red cover
and a whole bunch of knives.
Is that you?
No, I'm not.
I'm not.
I'm not.
I'm not.
I'm not.
So it's you,
the killer of the heroes.
Isn't that right?
I've been looking for you.
But I didn't think
I'd find you so soon.
It's me.
Your eyes.
And in them I see a thirst for revenge?
Watch your tongue.
Depending on the situation
even children can become my prey.
So I'm
not even a target?
Now listen to me,
criminal.
I'm
the younger brother
of the hero you attacked.
The younger brother
of the best of the heroes.
And as a child
I'll stop you.
Will you take me
for him?
You'll remember
my name
for the rest of your life.
Ingenue.
This is the name of the hero
that will crush you.
I see.
I'm dead.
The sequel follows.
I don't know
where you'll give up,
but I'm sure
there will be days
when you can't do anything.
The moment of
hard work
that's once in a lifetime
I want to see it
as many times as I can.
I want to be with you
no matter how long.
If you give me
meaning
and courage,
I'll be the best.
I'm
guilty of
making you say
it over and over again.
I'll stand up
and give you courage.
I'm
the younger brother
of the hero you attacked.
The younger brother
of the best of the heroes.
The younger brother
of the greatest of the heroes.
The only
hero
in my life
has been
me.
Here are the previews.
In the town of Hotsu which is under attack
by villains.
I've found you the killer of the heroes.
I'm the younger brother
of the guy you attacked.
Why did Ida choose this agency?
My brother was the best of the heroes.
I will not forgive you.
I... I will kill you!
Next, the killer of the heroes against the students of Yoya!
Yingeniu!
This is the name of the hero that will crush you!
Endless limit!
Plus Ultra!
