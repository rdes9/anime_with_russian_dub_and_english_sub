        <pre>After the lunch break, today's topic is whether the hero needs to be sexy.
And today in our studio...
...the newcomer who debuted this year, Lady Gora.
And...
...Polnoch, who teaches at the senior school of Yoy.
Thank you for coming.
Have a seat, please.
So, Polnoch.
When you just started to play the hero, your costume was the most challenging.
That led to the creation of a new law on gilded parts of the body, signed by the Japanese parliament.
You are known as a veteran who has changed the country.
And it still has a bad effect on you.
Now I use ultra-thin materials.
Many say that because of nature and their miracles, clothes can be shy.
There is no question of sexuality here.
Rather, as a result of necessity.
They began to consider it as sexuality.
Just like you are now, right?
What's wrong with you?
Are you trying to get into a fight?
Of course not, I'm just...
I think you are incredible.
For your age.
Do you want to say that your only advantage is your age?
Yeah, you're not that young.
If the older generation overreacts, it will be very difficult for the young.
What an incredible release!
Thank you for watching.

Episode 34
Preparation for the final exam
Okay, that's it for today.
There is a week left until the final exam.
I hope you are all working hard.
I'm sure you know.
This is not a written exam.
The practical part is included.
But train both mind and body.
That's all.
I didn't prepare at all!
Because of the sports festival and practice, I did my best!
That's right.
We had one event after another.
We started studying during the intermediate, so we didn't pass much.
I didn't have any problems with the material.
But because of all these events, I didn't have enough time to prepare.
If there is practice, then we will definitely fly out.
The ninth to intermediate.
I thought you were one of us.
Only stupid copies of yours could fly out.
And who can need you?
I think the whole world.
What about Kaminaria?
Let's try.
We all want to go to the camp together, right?
Yes!
As your senior, I hope you will start studying.
It will be difficult for you to fail if you are attentive to the class.
Follow the language!
I can help you with the teaching material.
Yao-momo!
I can help you with the teaching material.
Yao-momo!
But practice is different.
Can I join you?
I have problems with the quadratic functions.
What?
Can I join you?
What about the classical Japanese?
What?
I want to join you too.
I don't understand much.
Guys!
Of course!
Great!
Then let's have extra classes on weekends.
Really?
I want to see your house.
In this case, I will tell my mom to open the hall.
Hall?
What kind of tea do you prefer?
Tea?
We always drink Harat or Wedgewood.
So tell me about your preferences.
You can trust me in school.
I will show you how useful I can be.
I have a feeling that she stuck me in her superiority.
She is so cute that I don't care.
What did you say?
Harry?
Let's drink it.
Harot, right?
The difference in kindness is obvious.
I can do it too.
When should I give you knowledge?
Yeah, I'm counting on you.
I'm panicking.
You can't even breathe before death.
Maybe you should try?
What are you talking about?
Something's wrong.
The practical part.
I can't say what's going to happen.
It's scary.
I don't think there will be anything incredible.
The written part will be what we studied in class.
So everything is not so bad here.
Can you handle it?
Seriously.
What's going to happen in the practical part?
It's going to be a general test of all the material for the semester.
The teacher Aizawa will tell us everything.
Aizawa-sensei.
Everything we've already done.
Battles and rescue operations.
Basic training.
We have to be in good physical shape.
I'm sorry.
Your head is too big.
I put it on.
You're from the B class?
I heard that you met the killer of the heroes.
It's like a sports festival.
The class should always be in the center of attention.
Isn't that right?
Attention is attached to you not because
people believe in you,
but because you attract problems.
It sounds scary.
Someday we can all get into trouble
and suffer.
It's like a curse from a plague deity.
It's so scary.
Bonama, it's not funny.
You know what happened to Ida.
Kenda?
I'm sorry, A-class.
It's a heartless individual.
Heartless?
You said
that you don't know what's going to happen
in the practical part of the exam.
It looks like it's going to be
something like a battle with robots.
What? Really?
How did you know?
My old classmate friend told me.
That's not very honest.
I followed the rules.
That's right.
To gather information about the exam
is also part of the test.
I had to talk to them.
Why didn't I get there myself?
You're a fool, Kenda.
We had such an advantage.
It was our chance.
We could beat the damned A-class.
They're not damned.
She looks like the oldest sister
of the whole class.
We're going to beat the damn robots.
Cool.
You have trouble controlling
the monster against people.
Yeah, but there's nothing to worry about
against the robots.
They'll melt like candles.
Now you need me and Rose
to help you with your studies.
And you'll be completely ready.
We'll definitely get into the training camp.
One day you'll have to face
the greatest evil.
To be ready for him,
I have to do everything that depends on me.
People, robots,
it doesn't matter.
You just have to win.
You're idiots.
You called someone an idiot.
Shut up!
You need to control your own magic.
Yeah, Deku.
I don't know if you've learned
to control your own magic or not.
But you've crossed
the wrong person's path.
It looks like he's talking about
how Deku moved like he did yesterday.
Oh, right.
I don't need
a good result
like at a sports festival.
We'll have an individual score.
So we'll find out who's the best.
Do you want it or not.
You'll be crushed and crushed.
I'll kill you.
Tadaroki,
it's your turn.
I haven't seen
him so aggressive in a long time.
Patience
or hate.
Bakugo's character
is even worse than I thought.
Wow!
I knew she was rich.
But it's already
the end of the world.
Guys, I've been waiting for you.
Please come in.
I'm a little embarrassed and nervous.
Me too.
Something wrong?
Nothing.
The End
Give me back my pencils.
I'll have to put
and put it on the table.
Thank you, Yao-Mo-Mo!
I didn't leave an empty answer!
And that's how our three-day written exam ended.
And it's time to hand over the practical part.
So, we'll start with the practical part.
You can mess it up, but you have to try hard.
If you want to go to the training camp, then don't be stupid.
There are so many teachers here.
I hope you already have an idea of what you're going to have to face today.
You're going to have to fight robots like in the opening.
Fireworks, curry, courage tests. You've failed!
For various reasons, we decided to change the test rules.
Director Nezu!
Change?
We want to focus more on the battles one-on-one and on the hero's practice.
And we want to model a real battle.
So, you're going to be hit by a pair and you're going to fight against a teacher.
Against... teachers?
We've already hit you with a pair and divided you into teachers.
We've hit you based on your combat style,
your grades and interpersonal relationships.
So, Todoroki, Yao and Rose, the first team.
Fight me.
Midori and Bakugo, the second team.
And your opponent...
...will be...
...me!
You're all-powerful!
Work and tell them to beat me.

Considering the connection between the heroes and the villains,
there's a chance that the villains can attack again.
Of course, that's why we shouldn't let that happen.
We, as a school, need to be prepared.
If we're going to fight against the villains and help the society,
then I consider the battle with the robots to be pointless.
Initially, we decided to use the robots to avoid complaints
about the possibility of injury from the attackers.
We can just ignore them.
Let them say what they want.
We can't do that right now, can we?
I understand why you wanted to change the exam,
but to fight against us, and the two of us...
I think it's a little unfair.
If we win too easily, we won't be able to assess them.
We'll take that into account and complicate the tasks for them as much as we can.
Director Nezu, what do you think about this?
I agree with the changes in the practical part.
What do we have to do to save the students from even greater danger?
The answer is on the surface.
We have to make them stronger.
That's right.
No objections.
Then we'll decide with the teams.
The first one is Tadaroki.
He's good at fighting.
However, he often uses brute force.
And Yao and Rose.
It's universal.
But she can't quickly make a decision and implement them.
I'll wipe them out by surprise and take advantage of their weakness in close combat.
No objections.
Next, Midoriya and Bakugo.
I'm entrusting them to you, All-Powerful.
I'll unite them, not based on their capabilities or capabilities,
but on an interpersonal basis.
You're looking after Midoriya, aren't you?
Take care of them.
Aizawa, why are you so stubborn?
And now we'll announce the remaining two participants.
You have 30 minutes.
You have to put on the teacher's handcuffs.
Or go outside the arena.
Catch the teacher or run away.
It's like a simulation of a fight.
Can you really run away?
Yes.
But it will be completely different from your combat practice.
You will fight with a much stronger projectile.
You will fight with a much stronger opponent.
Stronger than us?
Who could it be?
Dummy!
Girl, watch your tongue, got it?
This time your exam will be similar to a real battle.
Think of us as villains.
Having faced an enemy that is weaker than you, you can relax.
However, if the enemy surpasses you in strength,
you should retreat and wait for reinforcements.
Ido, Midoriya, I'm sure the three of you understand this.
Idiot!
I'm the one who needs the killer and that guy in the white armor.
It's pointless to fight, just run!
I won't let this mistake happen again.
I'll pass this test and prove it.
Fight and win or run away and win?
That's right.
We are checking your ability to make decisions.
But I'm sure you're just thinking about how to run away, am I right?
That's why we asked the guys from the supply course to make this for us.
Heavyweights.
Their weight is half of ours.
It will give you an advantage.
It's a bit old-fashioned, but it's harder for us to move and we'll get tired faster.
Damn, it's harder than I thought.
By the way, we chose a design based on a competition
and the winner is Yuno Hatsume.
Hatsume-san?
Is this to let us fight on equal terms?
You underestimate us.
Whatever.
Great.
Each team will pass the test in a special arena.
Sato, Kirishima, get ready.
Yes!
Those who are waiting in line can watch the exam or come up with a plan.
Do whatever you want.
That's all.
Ujuro, I'd like to talk about our plans.
Of course.
Takayami, let's come up with a plan.
Okay.
Our main task is to spend the night.
No, why are you so cold?
Looks like I'm going to have a lot of work today.
Huh?
Deku, did you decide to take a look too?
Well, yes.
It's rare to have a chance to watch the battles of students and teachers.
Plus, I'd like to talk about the strategy.
I see.
Well, I...
It's useless to talk to him.
That's why I decided to watch the battles of the others.
Yeah.
I just have to pass this exam.
Sato Kirishima, practical part.
Get ready.
Let's get started.
We'll get a lot of points if we catch the teachers, right?
Looks like it.
The cement is moving slowly.
Let's go to the breakthrough and just get a lot of points.
Go!
Rikido Sato, miracle sugar berserk.
Eat 10 grams of sugar and you'll become five times stronger for three minutes.
But if he eats sugar, his IQ will immediately drop.
You decided to go straight?
Let's go, Sato!
Yeah!
Hooray!
Hooray!
Hooray!
Hooray!
Hooray!
Hooray!
Hooray!
It's not that easy.
You can do it, Sato Kirishima!
It's not that easy.
Their miracles are incredibly strong.
But they have a limit of use.
On the other hand, Cementos doesn't have such a limit.
The longer the exam, the more it's not profitable for them.
How come?
In this practical exam, we are fighting against the teachers.
And it won't be easy to beat them.
I think the most important thing is to use the weakness of the teachers.
That's right.
Before you start acting, you need to study the teacher well, with whom you have to fight.
I knew it.
Dude, they have no end!
They are getting bigger and bigger!
I'm falling asleep.
I'm tired.
Hey, don't stop!
Guys!
I'm out of breath.
You are both very weak in battle exhaustion.
You need to open your strong sides and use them in the current situation.
Sato Kirishima's team failed the exam, as the students lost consciousness.
Seriously?
Kirishima?
Oh my God, this is only the first match, and I already have so much work.
How come?
It's so easy.
Their miracles were too useless against him.
This exam is much more difficult than we thought.
In addition to everything,
the Kachans and I are fighting against...
We start in the middle of the podium, right?
To escape, we need to go through the designated gates.
This means that the teacher will be waiting for us right there.
Asu and Takayami, the practical part.
Get ready, start!
I forgot to tell you.
We can also use all the hand-held materials to defeat you.
Get ready.
And show me your determination.
The continuation follows.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
When I get mad,
Don't stop me,
Because this is my spring!
This is a preview.
Asu and Takayami are fighting against ectoplasma.
After all, Roki is fighting against iairose.
Against iazawa's teacher.
No.
Against the Aizawa teachers?
Everything was pre-determined before the match started.
Finish it faster.
I'm ready to start.
Aoyama, there's still Ida and Ojiro ahead of them.
They won't last that long.
You can't do anything about it.
Next!
Yauya Rose's rebirth!
I'll say something shocking in the last scene.
Don't miss it!
Endless limit!
Plus Ultra!
