It doesn't matter what you say, you're still a villain who hurt my brother.
Because of this you will die.
My body is paralyzed.
Goodbye, you will become a brick that I lay at the foundation of the best world.
I will not forgive you, I will kill you.
Hit!
Hit!
I came to save you, Ida.
Ida-kun!
Because of you I was late.
Midoriya? Todoroki?
The two of us are obliged to protect them.
Why the two of you?
Why?
Please, enough!
I inherited the name of my brother.
This is what I have to do!
This villain is mine!
I'm sorry, Todoroki.
Stop!
I'm already...
If you want to stop us, then get up!
Because of that, I will die.
A mirage.
The river of tears.
Let's get out of here and live.
Goodbye.
I can't forget what I lost.
I won't forget.
Regret and humiliation are in my heart.
I cut the truth and put my hands together.
I will return to the past.
I will return to the past.
I will return to the past.
I will return to the past.
I'll run to the future that everything is brightgie.
Episode 30 The culmination
Didn't you hear about sabotages?
Well, of course I heard. He is very popular.
There are 65 people working in his Tokyo agency.
This is my older brother.
He is a great hero who respects the law and leads a lot of people.
I decided to become a hero to be like him.
Ida...
The only thing I can advise...
...is to be who you want to be.
Ingenium.
This is the name of the hero who will crush you.
What kind of hero am I?
Friends protect me.
They shed blood.
First, save that guy.
The hero's killer.
To teach him a lesson,
I took the name of my brother.
I was blind to the things around me.
I was entangled only in my feelings.
Tanya, do you want to be a hero?
Yeah, you're cool.
Are you a robot?
Can you advise me something?
Why do you continue to be a hero?
Well, our parents are heroes.
So it was expected that I would become a hero.
Well, it's pretty simple.
When you see a lost child, you take him to his parents.
I think it deserves respect.
And why don't you take him to your parents?
Why are you taking care of the lost children?
What do you mean by that? Are you a robot?
You take everything literally.
You're smarter and stronger than me when I was your age.
Wait a minute.
Does that mean that if you admire me,
then I'm probably not that bad?
You're wrong.
Everything is as you said, hero killer.
To the right!
I'm not like them.
I'm not a hero.
I wasn't even close to them.
But even so...
Ice and flame.
I'll try to get back.
Didn't anyone tell you?
When you use your magic, your body becomes defenseless.
Damn monster!
Get out of the way!
If I don't get up now,
I'll never be able to catch up with them again.
Damn.
The effect is over.
Back!
Speed up!
He's fast.
Ida!
Did you sleep paralysis?
That's not as scary as I thought.
Todoroki, you fool.
I'm sorry for dragging you into this.
Again?
Yes.
That's why I won't let the two of you shed blood here anymore.
You want to show that you've realized your sinful nature?
Human nature?
You can't change that.
You'll still be a fake.
An animal.
You're a cancer tumor on the body of society.
And someone has to cut it out.
It sounds like the words of a fundamentalist fanatic.
There's no point in looking for logic in the words of a killer.
No, he's right.
I can't be called a hero.
And yet...
I can't give up either.
If I give up, the Ingenium will die.
You can't escape from destiny.
Idiot, the killer of the heroes came after me and that boy in white armor.
You don't have to fight him, just run!
Didn't you notice that we don't stand a chance anymore?
His tactics have changed.
Nerves are starting to give up.
And yet his charm is limited by the distance and the blood group.
And the effect is very fast.
His charm is not so good.
He clearly didn't expect to fight against a group of heroes.
His main goal is to kill Ida before she comes for help.
And this stupidity deserves madness.
Damn it!
Did I really damage the radiator?
Tadaroki, can you control the temperature?
I'm not used to the left side yet.
Something urgent?
Cool my legs!
Don't freeze the exhaust holes!
Drop the road!
Ida!
You too!
Ida!
Hurry up!
I can't move.
Can I?
No.
I just have to.
Damn it!
Thank you, Tadaroki.
I will fight.
Even without arms.
Reverse.
Speed up!
One for all.
Full cover!

I don't know who you are, my dear old man, but lay down on me.
Wow!
Why are you here?
Isn't it obvious?
Because I'm a hero!
I'm a hero!
I'm a hero!
I'm a hero!
I'm a hero!
I'm a hero!
I'm a hero!
I'm a hero!
I'm a hero!
I'm a hero!
I nearly scared him away!
But so?
He's too confident of himself!
Well, beware!
It's an inhuman creature!
It's got what it takes to absorb and generate energy!
But it can't guard againstå¢ƒ fireworks!
What is that helpless drama?
That's odd!
The wipeabouts are on file!
There's no way out, this creature's got a few tricks up his sleeve.
There it is.
Those two managed to escape.
If that's the case...
I'm gonna have to mess up the sidewalk.
I haven't practiced for a long time.
You're pretty good, old man.
So, where's the squad?
It's been three minutes already.
What kind of useless scum is this?
They've got nothing to do with it.
Let's get in touch with this weirdo and get to the more important stuff.
Shota!
There's a trap here, so follow me.
I'll show you the real hero's hideout.
Medoya?
Shota!
It's just his location.
Turn off your phone and follow me!
Where are you going, Shota?
Eko Street, 4-2-10.
When you're done, send the free heroes there.
I'm leaving it all to you.
I'm sure you can handle it quickly.
My friend might be in trouble now.
Shota!
Give this case to my assistant.
Go to the address I'll give you.
The effort will be enough to catch the remaining villains.
Come on!
I used too much power!
It's not broken, it's just not this!
They stopped him.
This is my chance!
You can't get away!
You'll get away as the winner!
Go on!
And I'll get away as a hero!
Get up, he's still...
It looks like he's unconscious.
We need to tie him up and take him to the station.
Do we have anything to tie him up?
And let's disarm him.
Good idea.
He's too strong!
Damn it!
Let's get everyone down!
Damn it, I can't see anything!
Where did he go?
Run!
The effort!
Yeah, his regeneration is impressive.
Well, if that's the case...
And this is what you call strength!
We'd never make it out of this experience!
began to see a lot of
No one will survive the fire.
Watch out!
Heroes, whose magic doesn't work on this evil?
Go to Echo Street in the fourth district.
Did the villains get there?
I don't know, but I'm counting on you.
He's fast.
Well, even so.
He won't get away.
Indian, can you move?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Um...
You hurt your leg, didn't you?
At least I can help you.
Thank you.
I should be grateful.
Yeah, the garbage can turned out to be a chest.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Your garbage can turned out to be a chest with treasures.
Todoroki, I'll pull him out.
You've got all your hands in the cuts.
I'm sorry.
I was completely useless.
No.
In a one-on-one battle, no one would stand up against the killer of the heroes.
He's too strong.
The three of us barely made him stronger, and he was also a fool.
Most likely, he was mad and didn't keep track of his actions.
In the end, he couldn't escape the final blow from Ida and Midoriya.
We need to get him to the station as soon as possible.
What?
What the hell are you doing here, kid?
Gran Torino?
Gran Torino!
You were supposed to be waiting for me in the train!
Who's that?
He's my mentor at the internship, Gran Torino.
Why are you here?
I was suddenly asked to come here.
Well, I'm not very involved in the situation, but now I'm glad you're all right.
Gran Torino, I'm sorry.
Damn it.
Toshinori behaved absolutely the same.
We're on the spot.
The mentor said there was a need for help, but...
Children?
And it looks like they're wounded.
Call an ambulance.
Hey!
That's...
Wait!
That's the hero's killer!
What?
Call the police!
Can you walk?
Only with someone's help.
And you?
I didn't get hurt.
But Ida...
He has a strong bleeding.
The doctors will be here soon.
Wait for them.
Guys...
You got a serious injury because of me.
I'm very sorry.
I was blinded by hatred.
And you forgive me.
You were so depressed that I didn't notice it.
What kind of friend am I?
Hold on to yourself.
You're our boss.
Yeah.
We fought the hero's killer for about 10 minutes.
But for us, it was like an eternity.
Get down!
The villain!
Hey, Midoriya!
Blood?
Did he get hurt already?
If he climbs too high,
he'll be out of reach of my magic.
Society is filled with fakes.
And criminals waste their power in the void.
Kara is waiting for you all.
So much noise.
This idiot insisted on his own.
I'll deal with them later.
All this...
For the sake of the highest good of the new society.
Hey, hey, hey!
What's going on?
How did he kill this kid?
And where did this kid come from?
I don't have enough words to describe it.
What the hell is going on here?
Why?
Why can't everything go the way I want it to?
Did he save the boy?
No, he took the hostage.
It's not the first time he's been killed.
Get ready for the fight!
Why are you standing there and clapping your eyes?
He's going to run away now.
How did it all come to this?
Yeah, it's taking a serious turn.
Just don't tell me...
...that he...
...was a hard worker.
Hero killer!
Wait for me!
One more lie.
I have to fix your mistakes.
I'll drown you in your own blood.
The meaning of the word hero...
...will be cleared from the false attack.
Come here.
Try to take me, you self-proclaimed.
The only one who's allowed to kill me...
...is the Almighty.
The Almighty
He...
Did he...
...lose consciousness?
After I heard...
...that the broken ribs...
...wounded his lungs.
No one was the hostage of his miracle.
But at that moment...
...and at that second...
...he was enough...
...to bring everyone down.
...to his death.
The sequel is coming.
Hero killer!
Hero killer!
The preview is here!
Just like me.
Why are you, not young Midoriya,
leading this show?
Who are you?
I'm the Almighty.
What? Who are you?
Your student, the Almighty.
Shinori, is that you?
Yes, it's me.
Who are you?
This can go on forever!
Next, the consequences of the attack
of the hero killer.
The new nickname of the young Todoroki
is Drabilka.
Without a doubt,
the Infinity is not the limit.
Plus Ultra!
