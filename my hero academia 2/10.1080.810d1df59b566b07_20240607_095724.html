        <pre>If you are somehow connected to the Almighty, then I have even more reasons to look for a battle with you.
My mother always cried as much as I remember.
Your left side is terrible.
Your right side is terrible.
Your right side is terrible.
Your right side is terrible.
Your right side is terrible.
Your left side is terrible.
Your left side is terrible.
Your left side is terrible.
Even without my father's miracle.
No, I will give up his legacy, taking the first place, and without my left side.
I do not care about your relationship with the Almighty.
I will defeat you even without my left side.
I'm sorry, but I can't lose.
I have to justify the hopes of those who supported me.
I will not give up.
Once upon a time, the plane that passed over us
I remember in a strange way
Even though there is no meaning, for some reason
On the night of the day I cried without my father
I just wanted to be strong
I was looking for the courage I needed for that
If cruel fate is determined
If it ever appears in front of me
Just for a moment, this moment
If you can breathe
I thought it would be okay
That heart
Once again
It's so dark, it's so dark
Someone in me sings
So passionately that I can't help it
I opened my eyes all the time
You laugh so that you will never be sad
The song to become such a hero
Farewell, the shadow of the pen
The story that rolls
You also want to be a hero, don't you?
Everything will be fine with you, and everything will work out
I knew it before, and now I forgot
The first fight of the second round
At this sports festival, they both showed that they are the best
Midoriya
He will attack using ice
Against
Todoroki
You can't let him attack, it won't do anything good
Like two irreconcilable rivals fighting for honor
It's time
To the fight!
Forward!
Crush!
It's so cold
Why is the wind so cold?
As I expected
He is ready to hurt himself to stop me
Wow! Midoriya blocked Todoroki's fall!
He doesn't know what kind of power the attack of the young Todoroki can be
That's why he doesn't even try to control the power of the blow
And that's all he can do against the ice at the moment
And still
Crush!
He did it again!
Damn it!
From what I know about his fighting style
I can conclude that there is no information about him
I have to come up with a plan
I have to find a gap in this
He provided support behind his back
So that he wouldn't blow up
Which once again proves the effectiveness of my approach
I have to sacrifice my hand to make this strategy work
I have to weigh everything
Think
Where is his weak spot?
I have six more attempts left
You...
Five more!
It's already started
Kirishima, you're awesome!
Respect!
Bakugo, the next swing will be between us
Let's lay down on all 100
You'll take your teeth out of your hand
Time will tell
Dude, you and Todoroki can carry out powerful attacks
Something like an explosion!
And you can carry them out non-stop
I'm not just an idiot
You don't have to overestimate me
What?
If you overwork your muscles, the muscle tissue will tear
And if you run for a long time, your breathing will collapse
I have a limit to using a miracle, like everyone else
That's why I was created a suit that allows me to make an explosion
Without hurting my body
The power of the miracle depends on the physical
And she has a limit
That makes sense
Against Todoroki, who takes everyone out with one blow
Midoriya wants to stretch the match
I'll finish everything quickly
Destroyer!
I used all my right hand fingers
Todoroki is approaching!
What happens next?
Damn!
Oh no, he's too close!
That was powerful
You're keeping me at a distance
It's not just about the miracle
His logic, skills, mobility
It's all sharpened by many years of hard work
He's already surpassed the average professional
It's not surprising, he's the son of a hard worker
Are you already out of breath?
You ran a little bit and broke your fingers
Is this your limit?
He's trembling
That's how it is
Damn!
I'm sorry
Thank you, Midoriya
Thanks to you, this man's mood is gone
Even without the miracle of my father
Who are you?
No
I will renounce his legacy
Having taken the first place without my left hand
You can't fight with your own hands anymore, can you?
It's time to finish this
Todoroki continues to attack!
It will be his final attack!
What are you looking at?
Bastard
He's broken
What is this farce for?
You're trembling, Todoroki
Todoroki
Your body is a miracle
You can't cool your body with a miracle anymore
But you could solve this problem with fire
With your left hand, right?
Everyone is showing their maximum
To become a little bit closer to your dream
To become number one
Do you want to win half of your strength?
You haven't even touched me yet
Well, come on!
Hit me with all your strength!
Damn you, Todoroki
This is not you
This mate
This bad guy
Drink from him
Good
Good
Good
Good
Midoriya, what are you up to?
With all your might?
Did that bastard come after you or something?
I'm just going crazy!
His movements.
They slowed down.
It's all because of the cold.
The limit of his strength can be compared to the amount of mana in the games.
Did he use her skills?
Close.
You don't have a single chance.
He knew I was going to go for the right leg.
This guy...
Imagine.
Microwave.
It's not going to explode.
It shouldn't.
No.
Never.
Wow!
Right in the liver!
Something interesting is going to happen.
It's going to happen.
It's going to happen.
He got him.
Even though Midoriya looks worn out.
He still went for the attack.
Why?
The ice is not that fast.
Midoriya, don't get too excited.
This is going to be a bad fight.
Midoriya's down!
Midoriya!
What do I do?
Midoriya thinks he'll recover his healing lady.
He's too weak.
He doesn't feel any pain.
Adrenaline doesn't allow it.
But these bruises...
He won't be able to take part in the next Tournament.
You can't always point out that you can't control your own miracle.
His power has fallen, but he's starting to control it.
He doesn't fight mindlessly.
Right now, it's better than what he can do to win.
That's the problem.
Even if he can recover,
in order to get through the hellish pain,
you have to be inhuman.
What's going on with them?
It's all up to you, Lucas.
He's omnipotent.
I want to be like him.
And to do that, I have to be the strongest.
Compared to you, my motivation is so insignificant.
My hands aren't listening.
Destroyer!
Destroyer!
What's wrong with you?
I want to justify their expectations.
I want to smile and answer them.
I want to be a hero.
That's all I need.
Yeah!
What?
That's why.
We're doing our best.
Everyone!
I don't know what's going on with you.
But if you want to be number one
and send your father to hell,
you have to stop making a fool of yourself.
Get up.
If you have such a small thing,
you might as well have a big mouth.
You won't even be able to hold a villain.
Please, that's enough.
He's only five years old.
He's already five.
Get out of the way, woman.
Mom?
Shut up.
I don't want to be a hero.
I don't want to be a hero.
I don't want to be a hero.
I...
I...
I don't want to be like him.
I don't want to be the one who's hurting mom.
I don't want to be a hero.
But you want to be a hero.
You want to be a hero, don't you?
So be it.
You...
If you know what you want to achieve...
That's why.
I'll win...
and surpass you.
Don't look at them.
You were created for different worlds.
Mom?
I'm going crazy.
I can't take it anymore.
Every day he becomes more and more like him.
And something...
His left side is just disgusting.
I can't stand being next to him anymore.
I can't stand being next to him anymore.
It's not going to end well.
Mom?
I...
Damn it.
This period is very important.
Where's mom?
Oh.
Since she hurt you,
I sent her to the hospital for mentally ill people.
It's all because of you.
It's you who brought her to this state.
I rejected...
the power of my father.
It's...
your power!
Yes, it is.
Children inherit miracles from their parents.
But this is not the main factor.
The most important thing is...
to accept yourself.
Accept yourself.
Accept yourself.
That's exactly why I'm saying this.
I'm here.
Got it?
But you want to be a hero, don't you?
You want to be a hero, don't you?
Well, then be one.
I knew it before,
but now I've forgotten.
You don't have to be the hostage of your genes.
You can become...
whoever you want.
Oh, it's...
What a flame!
In the battle,
I won't use my left side.
He did it.
You forced him to use his left side.
Young Midoriya,
didn't you really try to save young Dorochi?
You want to win, don't you?
Damn it!
And you help your opponent.
And who of us is still playing tricks, huh?
I want to be a hero too.
Damn it!
What?
You accepted yourself, didn't you?
That's how you hold on.
This will be your starting point.
You will surpass me
and fulfill my wish.
The hard worker decided to support his son?
Is that so?
Cool.
Why are you smiling?
With your wounds
and in such a state,
you're just crazy.
Don't blame me later.
Oh my God!
The can of his fire!
Midoriya!
If they continue like this...
His body will not stand it.
I'll get close to him
and have this final attack!
Come on, show me your best!
Thank you.
Hey!
What the hell?
Oh my God!
What happened?
If the blow is very powerful, it does not mean that it is safe, but it deserves respect.
What happened there?
What kind of class do you have?
The cold air was instantly warmed up.
And it caused an explosion?
And what was the temperature?
God, nothing is visible!
Hey, who is the winner?
Who is the winner?
Who is the winner?
Who is the winner?
Nothing is visible!
Hey, who is the winner?
Midoriya outside the arena!
Todoroki passes to the semi-final!

I'm sure you can do it, Ida.
Yeah, I can't lose after going so far.
I have to win and tell Tensei about it.
Next, Boris Ida.
Hello, mom.
Something happened to Tensei? What happened to my brother?
Endless limit.
Plus Ultra!
