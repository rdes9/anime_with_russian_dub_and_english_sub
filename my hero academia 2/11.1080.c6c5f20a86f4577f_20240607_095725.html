        <pre>Even without the miracle of my father.
No. I will renounce his legacy, taking the first place without my left side.
You want to win, trying half your strength?
You haven't even touched me yet!
You haven't even touched me yet!
Well, come on! Follow me with all your might!
What's wrong with you?
I want to justify their expectations!
I want to smile and answer them!
I want to be a hero!
That's all I need!
I renounce the power of my father.
That's your power!
I want to be a hero too!
Let's fight!
I'll get closer to him and make the final attack!
Midoriya.
Thank you.
Midoriya is outside the arena.
Todoroki is in the semi-final.

I was looking for it
If the cruel fate is determined
If someday it will appear before me
Just for a moment, this moment
If you can breathe
I thought it was okay
That heart
Once again
It's far away, it's far away
But someone in me
Someone sang
So passionately that I can't help it
I always opened my eyes
So that you will never be sad again
I laugh
A song to become such a hero
Farewell, shadow pen
Signs
The rolling story
Midoriya lost the semi-final?
He deliberately helped that guy and lost
Didn't he have a plan?
That's why he provoked him
Did he want to win or be defeated?
In any case, their strength is worthy of respect
But how can you use a miracle that will constantly hurt you?
He used it no matter what
Don't break his spirit
I started watching him from the battle of the horse
Get out of the way
You won't avoid me anymore?
Learn to control the newly acquired power
You will hurt others if you use it without thinking
You let go of your childhood grudges
And became an improved version of me
After the release, you will work with me
I will lead you on the road of the great
I didn't let go of anything
I didn't let go of anything
Such wounds just don't heal
She is still whining
But for a moment
I forgot about her
And it doesn't matter if it's good or bad
Right or wrong
I shouldn't forget it
I'll think about it
The bones in your right hand were broken
By the initial state, it can no longer be returned
I need to extract the debris so that they don't get into the joints
Come to another session
You use the methods that will drive him to the grave
And I don't like it
You're bending the stick
It's a very risky method
You shouldn't praise him for his bravery on the verge of madness
Midoriya!
How are you?
Oh, good day
Good day
It's noisy now, young people
Guys, what's going on in the arena?
They blew up the arena, so the organizers took a break to restore it
Midoriya, your match was scary
You were too bloodthirsty for the test
Stop it, don't sprinkle salt on his wound
But it's true
A mouth on a lock
I know you're worried about him, but I have to operate on him
Operate?
Yes, yes, put your feet in the handle and get out of here
But it's very dangerous
He will fully recover
Don't worry, everything will be fine
I'm sorry
I couldn't
I want you to tell me about yourself
If I didn't tell you
If I didn't motivate Todoroki
If...
You wanted to save him from loneliness
That's right
What?
Todoroki looked depressed
And I tried to reach out to him when it was not profitable for me
And yet
What's more important
I was just
powerless
I couldn't do otherwise
I'm so sorry
Yes, you can't say that you did a good job
And nothing will change if I say that you did a good job
But you know
Helping someone even when you're hurt
It's what makes us heroes
A joint acceleration
Shazaki is outside the arena
Ida wins
Ida wins
Ida wins
Ida wins
Ida wins
Ida wins
Ida wins
Ida wins
Dark Shadow
Yes
What's more important than the arena?
Takayami wins
What an easy win
Dark Shadow is strong
Are you worried about Midoriya?
She said she needed a surgeon
She's a healing lady
She can heal people like that
He's right
Well
Kiss
I've been healing you so you can walk
Thank you very much
That's what happens if you lose control over yourself
Your right hand will serve as a reminder
Ida
I won't be healing you anymore
You should think about changing your training
Otherwise this boy's life will be short
Changing my training?
All-powerful
You became a U.A. teacher to find yourself a successor, didn't you?
Yes
I gave everything I had to prepare for the sports festival
And I feel the indomitable determination of everyone
I thought someone else was supposed to be my successor
Yes
Yes, there are many capable heroes who are waiting for the great future
One of them is a great power
If the owner of the miracle, like young Todoroki, inherits it
Then together with the power of ice and flame
He will become the greatest of all the ever living
Then?
You know
I was also a wonder
A wonder? You?
It wasn't rare, but it couldn't be called ordinary
My teacher had a miracle
And he believed in me
And then he passed it on to me one by one
And made me a hero
You never told me about it
So you didn't ask
I knew you would ask one day
All-powerful, so you were also a wonder?
Yes
I was convinced of myself in you
But you surpassed me again and again
I believe that with this knife
Only you can handle it
I'm sorry
The sports festival is not over yet
Do me a favor and watch it to the end
Yes
Hello, Tensei
This is Tensei
Hello
Hello
Hello
Hello
Hello
Hello
Hello, Tensei
This is Ida
I'm on a mission right now
And I can't answer your call
Tensei
Do your best
Command A to the north
Command B to the west
Command A accepted
Command B too
What the...
There can be no doubt
It's him
I found him
This is the killer of the heroes
Bite him
What a blow!
Ha-ha!
I won't let you do that to me!
He didn't blink an eye
Looks like he's leaving not only because of the miracle
Kirishima!
Hit the jaw!
Right into her!
Yesterday the enemies are allies today
Kirishima and Kachan
So...
Ida and Takayami won the last tour
I would like to see it
I wanted to see it!
Vakuga is forced to retreat!
Kirishima continues to attack!
Kachan is defending
The power of Kirishima's miracle is in her simplicity
Midoriya!
Looks like you're doing well
I'm so glad
Yes, I'm fine
I can congratulate you, Ida
I made it to the semi-final
I analyzed your fight against Roki
This should help me
Yeah
Is your older brother Ingenium watching your performance?
I called him, but he was busy
Ah, so you called
You know, I think it's for the best
Going so far, I have to tell you about everything as number one
He is a great hero who respects the law and leads others along
I decided to become a hero to be like him
Vakuga has been attacked!
What happened?
Why did his attack work?
You kept your cover for too long, didn't you?
And if I do a couple of hits, your armor will fall apart like a plaster
I'll make you
And for dessert
Die!
I understand why you didn't want to delay our fight
Kirishima is immobile
Vakuga has won!
What kind of a moron are you?
You didn't have enough endurance, Kirishima
Vakuga is going to the semi-final
And we're going to see the consequences of the bombing
The four best have already been decided
Okay, I'm going
Deku
Midoriya, did everything go well?
Well, yes
Now I can walk
Don't you need to rest?
I want to watch the fights
Watch others make their dreams come true
The first semi-final match
Both of them are from the Heroic families
Tenya Ida from the Hero class
Against
Todoroki Shota from the Hero class
I can't resist his attack
And with the flame, he has even more opportunities for her
In this case
Let's go!
So you attack right away?
Yes
Ida is cornered
Todoroki is not going to fight him
Wow, what a high jump
Mutual
Acceleration
I have 10 seconds
Should I win now or never?
It's your hit!
He got hit hard
It was a wavey hit
I have 8 seconds left
I can do it
I'm going to push him beyond the limits
The silencers froze when he made it
During the hit
I was fighting for so long at a distance
That you forgot about my tricks, didn't you?
I tried to turn around
But it turned out to be more difficult than I thought
Ida is motionless
Todoroki wins
He passes the final without a single spark
I have to figure it out
Are you still hesitating?
How stupid
Ida
Brother
Glory
Money
They still call themselves heroes?
But you're not a hero
You're just a poor wrap
Only to him
I'll let him kill me
Only to the Almighty
Second semi-final
Bakugo vs Takayami
Bakugo can't be stopped
How did this shit get me?
What are these manners?
Takayami hasn't had any problems so far
But now it's as difficult as ever before
Takayami, what's wrong with you?
You were screaming as hard as you wanted
And now you're nervous
There must be a reason
The Dark Shadow can't attack because of the light from the explosions
He's not lucky with the enemy
This is his only weakness
Takayami can still win
I underestimated him
I don't have time to feed the Dark Shadow
If it goes on like this, I'm done
Is he trying to kidnap me?
He's moving faster and faster
Dark Shadow, grab him!
That's a turn!
Bakugo went to Takayami in the back!
Light and noise grenade
Well, that's it!
The arena is covered in smoke
What happened?
Did you know?
About the weakness of the Dark Shadow
I found out after a couple of hits
I even feel sorry for you
The result was obvious
Checkmate
I give up
Takayami gave up
Bakugo wins
The final is over
Bakugo wins!
In the final battle, the Satodoroki and Bakugo will go down!
Takayami is very upset now
I thought Takayami would win
Does that mean he can still be defeated?
He doesn't change color, does he?
I see
Bakugo had everything to win
Did you give up such a challenge?
He was just lucky with the opponent
They had weak tricks
Everything came to the show of the class's trick
Damn!
It doesn't matter who wins and who loses
The newcomers of this year are just amazing
Who will they choose from?
I wonder what the result of their confrontation will be
Watch them carefully and we won't lose anymore
Aida?
What's wrong with you?
It's my phone
Phone?
Mom?
Hello
I'm sorry, mom, I lost
I didn't have enough...
I didn't want to talk about this
I'm sorry
Tenya, please listen to me calmly
Your brother, Tensei
There was a villain and...
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry, Tensei
There was a villain and...
You didn't even notice
How your rotten society
was covered with the growth of the face of fame
To all those who call themselves heroes
I will show them their true essence
You don't need sudden movements
We are something alike
I need you
I was looking for you, hero killer
I heard that they were talking about you
and I wanted to meet you
Can you spare me some of your time?
Hero killer

Endless limit.
