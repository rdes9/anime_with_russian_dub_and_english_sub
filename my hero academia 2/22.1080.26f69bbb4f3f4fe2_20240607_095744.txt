Team Asui and Takayami, get ready for the practical part.
Get set, go!
I forgot to tell you.
We, the teachers, also have to stop you with all our strength.
Let's go!
Let's go!
Team Asui and Takayami, get ready for the practical part.
Get set, go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go, Dark Shadow!
Asui, I'll throw you!
Takayami!
It's good that we thought about it in advance.
Yeah.
They're good. Only these two could turn this around.
It's mutual understanding.
In our society, every hero must be able to establish contact.
You must not only reach synergy with your partner,
but also reach a reflective understanding with him.
And if you take into account the fact that this is an exam,
the student must cope with their weaknesses.
You're right.
I wonder what Asui and Takayami must cope with.
I didn't think that a miracle of ectoplasm could interfere with them somehow.
No, for Fumigaki, Takayami is supposed to be a problem.
What's the point?
You'll see.
And yet you avoid the battle.
However...
Ectoplasm!
A miracle of clones!
It produces ectoplasm, which turns into its clones.
At once, it can produce 30 clones.
Unexpectedly, after two or three songs in karaoke,
this number increases to 36.
Let's get started!
Thank you!
Dark Shadow!
They have no end.
However...
Takayami is about his speed,
and the range of attack allows him to keep the distance.
However, if someone comes closer,
he won't be able to do anything.
Does Takayami have such a weakness?
So why?
Ectoplasm clones that can appear from nowhere.
On the other hand, Tsuya Asui is a wonderful student,
without visible shortcomings.
However, she must support her ally,
who, as you said, has some weaknesses.
Her ability to stay calm
can morally support anyone in a critical situation.
Moral support?
Now I understand that in the USG,
she really helped us.
You're going all out, Asui.
Takayami.
That was 28.
Takayami, I see our goal.
And this...
looks like his real body.
You did well with my clones.
But what are you going to do to this?
Giant clone!
I can't create clones now,
but as long as I see you,
it will be enough.
Asui, dodge!
Only I can create clones.
And what are you going to do?
What an insidious wonder.
I can do that too.
Dark Shadow, you just have to go through the gate.
Got it!
You bastard!
He won't be able to break through the defense.
But if he reaches the goal,
we'll have a chance.
Did you take this Dark Shadow, Takayami?
This?
What?
Don't look so closely.
The teacher will notice.
However...
This is Ibrahimovic.
This is really disgusting.
Can you hold out until the end of the exam?
All I want is a hero
who can cope with all the obstacles of fate.
Dark Shadow!
Calm down.
Everything's fine.
It's all thanks to Takayami and Dark Shadow.
And their power.
If we move,
it will be our last chance to win.
So I swallowed it myself.
I can put in and take things out of my stomach.
Got it.
They put handcuffs on him.
They did it.
Dark Shadow and the Frog.
They managed to combine their powers.
Yes, what a miracle.
I'm so happy.
I'm so happy.
I'm so happy.
Takayami and the Frog passed.
Takayami and the Frog passed.
Yes, as I expected.
Team Asui Takayami passes.
It was pretty clever.
You deserve praise.
That's all thanks to me, right?
Takayami and Asui passed.
As expected.
And the place is getting smaller and smaller.
Did the Power Loader teacher do that?
Old man, what do we do?
The terrain makes our enemy feel good.
In order to minimize the damage and to beat him,
we need to find a hero,
whose skill we're going to be using against him.
That would be perfect.
In other words, we should run,
but...
On the way to the exit,
he set up a bunch of traps,
and we don't know what to do.
Even so, we're going to do it.
While we're working together.
Hmph.
Alright.
Flaming!
I don't feel so good about this.
Let's go, Odger!
Acceleration!
We're moving faster than the holes appear.
If that's the case, we'll move on.
That's interesting!
We're moving faster than the holes appear.
That's interesting!
Oh, no!
We're falling!
Do something, Tenya!
Tenya!
Turn my leg around with your tail!
Turn my leg around with your tail!
Joint rotation!
What the...
No!
Great job.
And the next team moves on.
Captain!
That was a volleys decision,
and you didn't live long enough.
You started rotating fast enough
to hook up your friends
and not hurt yourself.
Not bad, you made it.
Thank you very much.
You're both incredible.
I'm going to go through the path of
becoming a real hero.
You're so cool, Iida.
Iida!
I can't get out.
It's not cool at all.
It's our turn.
Let's go.
Yoyo and Rose,
are you excited about something?
No.
Well, given who our opponent is,
I have an idea.
Team Todoroki
and Yoyo and Rose,
the exam is almost over.
Let's get ready.
Sounded with the support of Jump Club,
Vk.com, Slash Jump Fans,
and subscribe to the channel
on Twitch,
twitch.tv, Slash Jump Club.
Yoyo and Rose,
no matter how,
just create something small.
If you can't do it,
it will let me know that Izao's teacher is close.
The famous leader of the first A class,
Shota Aizawa.
He can erase the wonder of those who see.
The effect falls when he blinks.
The result of the exam depends on
who finds the first one.
As soon as I see him, I'll disarm right away.
And you have to stay close and run through the gate.
So be close.
Something's wrong.
Hurry up and create something.
Yeah, okay.
I got it.
Yoyo and Rose, I said something small.
What is it?
Russian matryoshkas.
Got it.
Let me know if your miracle
behaves strangely.
I didn't expect less from you,
Todoroki.
What are you talking about?
You were able to develop a plan
against Izao's teacher so quickly
and was able to fit it perfectly
for the enemy.
Nothing unusual.
Nothing unusual?
As the students who passed the U.A.
on recommendation,
we started from the same place.
But as for the practical skills,
I don't stand out at all.
During the battle with the Horseman,
I just did what you said.
I lost my battle
even before I managed to do something.
Yoyo and Rose, your matryoshkas.
He's close.
I'm sorry.
If you get it,
then you need to act.
In this case,
I should just dodge
and not look down on you.
Yoyo and Rose, run!
Was that your plan?
Everything is just perfect.
In any case,
I wanted to arm you first.
Since you're an attacker.
Did you catch me?
I can still freeze and set these putas on fire.
It doesn't matter what you do.
Be careful during the descent.
Rope hedgehogs?
Are you a ninja?
To run to such a dirty trick.
Everything is not as it was then
with the murder of the heroes.
I know about the reasons and numbers of the heroes.
I was well prepared for your exam.
You've done too much for yourself.
You were quite respectful of this lady.
Maybe you should talk to her.
Talk to her?
How much more to the gate?
Maybe I can cut it off?
Is everything okay with Todoroki?
Everything is going as it should.
Can I somehow speed up?
Is everything okay?
Can I run away?
Where am I running to?
Why?
What's going on with our plan?
I want to go to the sports festival.
She doesn't feel confident.
Teacher Aizawa!
What happened to Todoroki?
Damn it!
I'm going to hit your painful points.
Who's going to stay on your feet?
I have no chance against the teacher.
What?
My charm was not erased?
Creation!
I'm sorry Todoroki!
Did she come back to the wrong side?
She allowed him to determine their fate.
Comparing herself with Todoroki,
she decided that he was better than her.
Watching Todoroki,
who has no doubt at all,
she has lost the ability to make decisions.
She acts like a 15-year-old child.
I would like to help her
to believe in herself again.
But now I have another task.
You had to discuss this in advance.
I think she wanted to say something.
Todoroki!
Todoroki!
Yoyorozu!
I'm sorry, I couldn't!
Hey, Teacher Aizawa is approaching!
Should I save Todoroki
or run?
What should I do?
What should I do?
Yoyorozu!
Do you have a plan?
I'm sorry, I had to ask.
Do you like our plan?
What are you going to do?
But your plan didn't work.
Since it's my idea.
All right, just do it!
You are one of those
who should get the best result.
When we voted for the teacher,
you got two votes, right?
One of these votes belonged to me
because I thought
you were a good fit for this role.
It's not fair.
It's not fair!
Have you given up already?
But...
Todoroki, close your eyes!
What is it?
Light grenades?
I have an idea, Todoroki!
I have a plan!
A special plan to beat Aizawa's teacher!
A special plan?
Yes, I've been thinking about it
since the very beginning.
Just tell me what to do.
The consequences of the attack on the USG.
The time of my actions
has decreased,
and the period of re-preparation has increased.
If she attacked, I know,
then I'll give her food.
Fire!
Damn!
Todoroki, we need to hide together!
The eyes of Aizawa's teacher
have become less stable.
Is it all because of the attack on the USG?
Are we going to take advantage of it?
No, we just have to get out of his sight.
It's just a matter of time.
We can win!
Time?
Get out of his sight?
Can we really do it?
Our tricks are useless.
Do what I say!
Keep trying to use the ice!
I'll catch you!
To think that we can't use the spell
is pretty self-confident.
We will have only a moment.
While Aizawa's teacher is blinking,
you are using the spell again.
And here it is!
And you will be able to use the moment
and suck it!
The ice wall you showed at the festival!
Taka!
Did they see it coming?
Not bad.
Yes, you have to hit
the weak spots of the opponent.
I blocked the wall
and at the same moment my trick came back.
Our tricks are now active.
Tell me the rest of the plan while we...
Aizawa's teacher's weapon?
Yes.
I don't know what it's made of
or how it works.
I think his self-confidence may suffer.
But I made my version
with the addition of special material.
It's still a private sector.
We have to reduce the destruction to a minimum.
And because he moves so fast,
it's almost impossible to catch him.
That's my plan.
Why is Aizawa's teacher
not pursuing them?
Most likely he's overworked.
What do you think, Todoroki?
I think our chances of winning
are much higher now
than when we were just trying to run.
Everything will be solved in a moment.
Do you agree?
Yes, everything is fine.
The gate is behind me.
I should decide their tactics
if I follow them blindly.
I have an idea!
A special plan!
What the hell?
Molokons?
I can't get rid of them
until I see them.
But that has its drawbacks.
There were mannequins on top.
We have to do only one thing.
Catapult!
Is she wrong?
Todoroki! It's time for your flame!
He aimed at me?
What?
I didn't think we could
defeat Aizawa's teacher
in an open clash.
That's why...
Did you hear about
the nickel-titanium alloy?
As it heats up,
it becomes solid again.
It's an alloy with a form memory!
That's impressive.
Everything went according to your plan.
But could it be so simple?
Honestly, I didn't expect that.
When I just wanted to launch the catapult,
I made a mistake.
Aizawa's teacher noticed it,
but he still jumped back.
Even so, he could stop me with ease.
It seems that he deliberately
allowed us to turn our plan around.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I just wanted to turn our plan around.
I just tried not to get
hit by your blow, Todoroki.
I could see you,
but Todoroki was hiding his balaclava.
I thought he would freeze me.
I can say that
he acted as pragmatically as possible,
and then hit you right in the hand.
As you said,
it was just a matter of time.
Thank you.
What happened? Are you sick?
Nothing.
If you're sick,
I know one thing.
I told you, everything's fine.
Oh, my God.
It's true that men
are soft by nature.
Todoroki's team
and Yauyurouzuo have passed.
To be continued.
To be continued.
To be continued.
To be continued.
To be continued.
To be continued.
To be continued.
To be continued.
To be continued.
To be continued.
To be continued.
To be continued.
To be continued.
To be continued.
To be continued.
To be continued.
To be continued.
The zone is in front of the gates.
We were so close to the exit!
Well, no, I won't let you escape.
The thirteenth sucks us!
I'm not very good at fighting,
but I can neutralize you.
It's almost impossible
to escape the black hole of the thirteenth here.
Yes,
they need a plan.
At least some kind.
Can some kind of miracle work endlessly?
Do you like being a joke?
We somehow got into the front row.
You know that my suit
transmits energy through my butt.
And this means
that we are not in trouble at all.
I can suck the light too.
I'll split it at the molecular level.
And this is not a joke.
What kind of idiot are you, Taoyama?
I am me.
Everyone is bad, we are just caught.
Think about how to get out of this front row.
Think!
What would Deku do in my place?
Hey!
Hold on, I'll do it right now!
You thought Midoriya would do
Izuku in your place, right?
Do you like him?
Do you like him?
Do you like him?
Do you like him?
Preview again!
The second part of the exam!
Uraraki Ohayama against the thirteenth!
Kamenari Eashida against the director!
Shouji Hagakure against the sniper!
And we have to fight the almighty
to become heroes!
I'm really excited right now!
Deku!
What is it, Uraraka?
It's so hard for me to say when you're so excited.
Well, Mineta just runs away!
Next, remove the lacquer!
Sarah is calm to sleep on something.
Endless limit!
Plus Ultra!
