        <pre>Kurogiri, get rid of them.
It's a complete set of things I hate.
Jerks.
And grubians.
All right, all right.
They took a long way to get here.
Let's at least listen to them.
Yes, and this rascal brought them.
They must be very useful.
I don't care what happens to them,
but I'll get my money and it doesn't matter how.
Let me at least introduce them.
The first is a cute old lady.
All her affairs are silenced on national television,
but she is suspected of multiple murders
related to blood loss.
I'm Toga.
Himeko Toga.
Life is so hard.
I want to create a world where I will live much easier.
I want to become just like Mr. Stein.
And I want to kill him.
So let me join the gang of villains.
I don't understand her at all.
Is she crazy?
She can support the conversation.
I'm sure she will be very useful.
Well, he hasn't committed any crimes yet,
but soon he will have to get into the killer's ideology.
It's not so easy for me.
Does this organization have a goal at all?
And don't tell me you're going to take this crazy fool.
So you're not capable of the fact
that this snot is still rolling in the gills.
Name your name.
You're an adult, aren't you?
My name is Dabi.
Are you serious?
Name a real name.
I'll name it when the time comes.
In any case, I will fulfill the will of the killer of the heroes.
Don't reveal your mittens when you're not asked.
Damn.
Everyone is so worried about this Stein.
I don't like it that way.
I'll kill you all.
Calm down, Tomura.
If you want your wish to come true,
we have to increase the number of our supporters.
It's pretty weird, but now we're in the center of attention,
so we have to act.
We shouldn't refuse them.
We need to accept them.
You have to use them.
And the ideology of that psycho too.
I'm sorry, Tomura.
Shut up.
Where are you going?
Shut up, I said.
I don't want to complain about our client,
but he's still young.
Even too young.
I thought he wanted to kill us.
He gave me a lot of nerves.
Can we give you an answer tonight?
I hope he knows what to do.
He left silently,
and that means he'll be back.
The Almighty, the killer of the heroes.
He was humiliated twice.
I'm sure he'll find an answer,
and you'll both be happy with it.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Don't use that either!
I don't want to listen to you anymore.
I only want to hear from you this whole time.
You don't need to listen to me anymore.
It's only your idea of my future,
it's not yours.
It's own recipe in my hands.
It's my fate.
It's my fate.
It's a must! It's a must!
Let's go to the bright future!
Guys, I'm waiting for you to tell me about the camp.
I'm looking forward to it.
It's still not decided. Maybe it was a test?
Enough, Midoriya.
Don't say a word, or you'll get it.
If we fail the exam, we'll miss the camp and spend the whole summer in hell.
And we didn't pass the practical part.
If you still don't understand anything, then even more stupid than us.
Calm down, it's already too much.
I don't know anything either.
Our team was pulled out by Mineta.
And I just slept.
And we still don't know how they count the points.
I feel so sorry for you, so bring us souvenirs.
A call to everyone to take their places.
Good morning.
I'm sorry you have failed the exam.
About the training camp in the forest.
They're all going.
Rescue in the last minute.
We can go too.
Really?
Yes.
You failed the practice, but everyone coped with the theory.
You failed the practice.
Kirishima, Kaminari, Ashido, Sato and Seiro.
I knew it.
Even if my team passed, it doesn't mean I got enough points.
During the exam, we were villains.
And we gave students a chance to win.
We tried to assess your ability to react to situations.
If we didn't do that, most of you wouldn't have passed.
So when you said you wanted to crush us...
It was a trick to scare you.
The training camp must increase your strength.
If you failed, you need to become stronger.
It was a lie for good.
A lie for good?
I was deceived again.
Ayoe is not so simple.
But if you deceive us twice, then our faith can shrink.
Wow, I didn't think you were such a wimp.
Yeah, I saw it coming.
But there's a fair share here.
Failure is failure.
And we prepared extra classes for you all.
And it's much worse than regular classes at school.
Well, I'm glad we're going together.
I'm glad we all went together.
A week in the camp?
How much do you need to take with you?
And I don't even have a swimming suit.
You need to buy so much.
Night vision glasses.
We're leaving tomorrow, the exams are already over.
Why not go shopping for the whole class?
Oh, great idea.
It's the first time we're all going somewhere together.
Hey, Bakugan, are you coming too?
Yeah, I'm already running around.
Are you coming with us too, Todoroki?
I'm visiting my mother on the weekend.
What kind of swindlers are you?
Just forget about it.
We're here!
In the largest mall in the prefecture.
In the mall of Kiyashi.
They don't try to sew something that would suit every person.
They have a ruler for each age and body.
You're scaring the children.
Oh, these are U8 students.
First-year students?
Oh, I saw them in the store.
Sports festival is just a cannonball.
Oh, there are still those who remember us.
Oh, there are still those who remember us.
Oh, there are still those who remember us.
Oh, there are still those who remember us.
I need a big bag.
Okay, then let's go together.
I wonder where to buy little swindlers.
I don't have shoes to go out, so I need to buy some.
Oh, I don't have any either.
In the booklet it says to buy a shoe that you don't feel sorry for.
Oh, you have to choose based on usefulness.
We all need something.
Let's all meet here later, okay?
Okay, then let's meet here at 3 o'clock.
Okay, then let's meet here at 3 o'clock.
Let's go!
Everyone ran away so quickly.
Everyone ran away so quickly.
Yeah.
And what about you, Uraraka?
I wanted to buy some weights.
And I need an insect spray.
You like it, don't you?
You like it, don't you?
Spray...
Insect spray!
Do I look like a bug?
He's making a mistake.
How else can he make a mistake?
Probably.
We came together.
I'm the only one left.
Wow!
It's a student from U.A.
Give me an autograph.
Didn't you get it at the sports festival?
Well, yeah.
Wow, U.A. is just incredible.
So many people watched us and remember us.
So many people watched us and remember us.
Listen, isn't it you who
fought with the murder of the hero in Hoso?
So cool!
Do you know so much?
Dude, I can't believe it.
I can't believe
that I saw you in such a crowded place again.
It makes me think
about fate
or destiny.
I think
we haven't seen each other since the attack
on the Heroic Academy.
Why don't we
have a cup of tea
and a sip of Midoriya?
Shigarake
Tomura!
Episode 38.
Meeting.
What's the point of murder
without a higher purpose?
Meet the killer of the heroes.
Many people think it's not my business.
No,
they don't have such thoughts.
It doesn't matter
where, why and why
someone kills.
These people keep smiling and surviving.
Oh, it's the killer of the heroes!
It's okay that we buy it.
You'll get into trouble for sure.
It's a very bad idea.
Cool!
But on the other hand,
you have fans
who are far from your initial goal.
What's wrong?
Our methods are the same.
You got rid of
what you didn't like.
But what's wrong?
What's the difference between us?
See yourself naturally.
We are old friends.
And only without stupidity.
Got it?
Calm down and get your breath back.
I want to talk to you.
That's all.
You just have to try.
It's fun.
It's so simple.
As soon as all my five fingers
touch your neck,
the skin on your throat
will rot indescribably.
You will turn into dust
less than a minute.
If you do it in a crowded place,
the heroes will catch you.
I'm sure it will be so.
But look at these people.
They can all use
their wishes.
So why are they smiling?
And all because of the law
and the rules that
imply the presence of morality in people.
Confidence in morality
flies in the air.
I can kill 20.
No.
I can kill 30
before they catch me.
You wanted to talk about it?
You catch quickly.
We have time to chat.
So let's sit down somewhere.
Oh, how I hate all this.
But most of all,
I hate the killer of the heroes.
Isn't he your accomplice?
I never said that.
But the news did it for me.
That's the problem.
Everyone only does what
they see fit.
The attack on Yue
and the outburst of Nomuhusu.
He crossed out all this.
No one looked at me at all.
Why?
No matter how proud he was,
in the end he destroyed
everything that annoyed him.
What's the difference between us?
Midoriya.
I ran away
because of the excitement.
I put Deku in an awkward position.
I shouldn't have left him alone.
Yes, I have to come back
and apologize.
Do I have to come back?
No, not like that.
I never wanted to
go shopping with him.
At first I thought
he was cool and wanted to be a hero
just like me.
I have to come back.
No, it's not like that.
What kind of nonsense is this?
What's the difference?
I can't
understand your motives.
I don't agree with the
motives,
but I can understand
his motives,
because for him and for me
it all started
with the Almighty.
It's all for
creating a better world.
At least
I was saved that time.
At least
he didn't destroy everything
just because he wanted to.
The game is over.
Shouldn't we leave?
He didn't give up
unlike you.
Maybe the methods
he used were criminal,
but he tried to spread
his idea.
That's what I think.
Just like a stone
from the soul.
I think I understand everything.
I understand why
he takes me out of myself.
Just like you.
Now I understand.
It's all the fault of the Almighty.
Exactly.
I found myself in a world
where everyone is responsible for their own words.
Why did I worry so long?
They smile
because the Almighty
does the same thing.
It's all because
this bastard
smiles all the time.
As if he can save everyone.
I'm so glad
that I was able to talk to you.
It's just great.
Thank you, Midoriya.
I don't need anything else.
Don't resist.
Did you want to die?
You don't care
how many people can die?
How ironic.
Hero killer.
You were my enemy,
but you spared me,
and now I will put your ideals
and beliefs
in the foundation of my future plan.
Deku?
Is he your friend?
No.
Come on, quickly.
Put your hands away.
What are you doing?
Shut up!
So you're here with a friend.
I'm sorry.
Well, I'm going.
You'll follow me,
but you'll hurt others.
Deku!
Wait!
Tomura Shigaraki!
Shigaraki?
What do you want?
All for one!
Who knows?
You should be more careful,
because when we meet again,
I'm going to kill you.
What's the purpose of a murder
without conviction?
I had ideals
and convictions from the very beginning,
hero killer.
Just like before.
But now
my actions will be based only on them.
To create a world
without the Almighty
and show all the fragility
of the current order.
And now
I can call it my goal.
The only one who is allowed
to kill me
is the Almighty.
Everything
is because of the Almighty.
Uraraka told me
about what happened
and the mall was temporarily closed.
The heroes and the police
carried out independent investigations.
But Tomura Shigaraki
was never found.
That day I was brought
to the police station
and I talked to Sukauchi
about the investigation
of the crime league
from the beginning.
From what I heard,
I conclude that this is not a single group,
but the main part of it
wants to defeat the Almighty.
In any case, thank you, Midoriya.
You're always welcome.
I would like to detain him.
Come on, everything is fine.
You did everything right
when yours and the lives of others
were hanging on the hair.
Many would panic and be scared.
It's not just because of your endurance.
Young Midoriya!
Sukauchi!
Almighty?
Why?
I have a couple of personal questions to him.
Thank God.
I'm glad you didn't get hurt.
Sorry, I couldn't save you.
No.
It's all right, Almighty.
Is something wrong?
Even you can't save
someone's life sometimes?
Yes.
And quite often.
Someone can be wounded
or on the verge of life and death.
It's strange,
but I'm a human too.
I can't save everyone.
There's one more reason
to never be sad.
So the symbol of justice
will be able to settle in the hearts
of people, heroes, and villains forever.
His concern is what Shigaraki said.
It's very similar to Klebito.
He never retreated
and always fought until the end of victory.
Well, we chatted a bit.
Someone came after you.
Izuku!
Mom?
Izuku!
I can't take it anymore!
My heart can't take it!
I'm sorry, it's all right.
I'm all right.
Don't cry.
The police and the heroes
will take good care of you.
Sansa, take them home.
Yes, sir.
It looks like
it was an accidental meeting,
but the probability
that it could happen again
is extremely high.
We will continue to closely monitor
their activities,
but the school should also react
to what is happening.
The brighter the light, the more the shadow.
You have to think about
leaving the UAE.
I taught a little more than
three months ago.
That's why I say
it's not yours.
Let's remember
what he is like now.
Yes.
Now.
Zukauchi,
I'm counting on you.
Yes.
From the time of the entrance test
and practical training,
the attack of the League of Criminals
and the sports festival,
the internship,
the HOS incident
and the final exams,
a lot has happened
during the first semester.
It's time for summer holidays.
But that doesn't mean
it's time to have fun.
We have to be ready
to give our best
to the enemy
and to become
real heroes.
We don't have time
to fool around.
You look
pretty happy, Master.
Is it because
the League of Criminals
is on the move?
No.
It's not like that, Doctor.
Tomura Shigaraki
has finally achieved his goal.
And the League of Criminals
needs people who
will be able to
help them.
You know,
the League of Criminals
needs people who
will be able to help them.
I'll help him
solve all the problems.
If he asks for help,
I'll help him.
I've already prepared everything.
Now he's ready
to become my successor.
The end!
See you next season!
