        <pre>The world began to be inhabited by superhumans, and about 80% of people were with these miracles.
In a world full of chaos, the profession that everyone dreamed of and that everyone respected became prestigious.
Righteous heroes fight against villains and save people.
Yes, this story is about how I became the greatest hero.

The next challenge is the Battle of the Horseman.
42 students will take part in it.
Izuku Midoriya, now your head costs 10 million points.
Everyone in this arena has a chance to return to the game.
Everyone in this arena has a chance to return to the game.
Not only Bakugo and Todoroki see the opponent in you.
This time the victory will be mine.
Uraraka.
On the spot.
Hatsume.
Takayami.
I'm here.
I'm counting on you.
Yes, I know.
Takayami.
Call me Takayami.
Takayami.
Call me Tsu.
Kachan.
Where are you going?
Damn it.
Takayami.
Takayami.
I'm taking your badge.
Episode 18. Battle of the Horseman.
Your plan seemed to me to be a failure, so I joined you.
And where did you lose your badge?
I don't know.
Now we have nothing to lose.
Shoji, turn on the berserk mode.
We'll beat them like a stick.
I thought there would be no conflict until the last stage of the festival.
He seems to have a high opinion of you, Midoriya.
There's not much time left.
We continue to maneuver.
Ida.
Full forward.
Yes.
Yaoirozu, prepare the insulator and the guide.
Yes.
Kaminaru, you...
Yes, yes, I'll do everything in the best possible way.
Look, Bobo.
We don't have a single group on our tail.
Let's check your shadow for strength.
Chaotic discharge.
1,300,000 volts.
Kaminaru.
Less than six minutes left.
We have nowhere to retreat.
I'm sorry, I didn't want to.
What was that?
It's easy on the road.
I disengaged a good half of the participants.
He used the electricity of Kaminaru, and then froze them.
It was expected.
He took into account how the participants coped with the obstacles.
Slightly marked.
And it won't be unnecessary.
Damn!
What? You took mine too?
What's wrong with Rance?
Backpack, he still needs to be modified.
Damn, the pressure is rising. We can't get away.
I'll hold them.
Yaoirozu!
Oh, come on.
We're going to have a hard time with her magic.
No.
It's worse with Kaminaru.
My strength level is low now.
But during the day, it's easier for me to control my magic.
Exactly!
You'll become our key defensive figure.
And you can't worry about attacks.
That's why...
Interesting.
My attack skill is very good.
Interesting.
My attack skill is getting stronger in the dark of the night.
But it's harder for me to control it.
But in contrast to that, during the day it's more effective.
But the power of the attack is significantly reduced.
Did you know that I would be useless in the attack?
But you still called me into the team.
Even in such a difficult situation, you don't give up.
Great.
I trust you with my power.
I'll use it with my mind, Midoriya.
I see.
Kaminaru's units are twinkling during charge.
And while we're fighting them,
our attacks won't work.
The shadow is absolutely useless.
I'm a pacifist.
Midoriya's team is cornered!
The attacking force is crushed.
Do they know about it?
I don't think so.
Only Kodo knows about my weakness.
And he keeps his mouth shut.
Well, we have to take advantage of this.
The stakes are made.
We'll keep these 10 million at any cost.
The slingshots for the class are too predictable.
We're surrounded!
What did you yell, you jerk?
Come on, give it to me, I'll tear it to pieces.
You're famous, aren't you?
Sacrificing the sedentary villain.
Will you tell me in person
how the villains attack you
with such an enviable frequency every year?
Kirishima.
Change of plan.
Monoma, don't provoke him.
Don't go down to his level.
Yeah, yeah, I behaved like a bad hero.
Didn't you hear?
And the villains who fell from the hands of the villains?
What did they want to do together?
Baku, cool down.
If you don't calm down, our balls will burn with him.
Kirishima, push the gas.
Now!
My calmness is at its limit.
As you know, you are our captain.
Go!
Die!
Die!
Wow, that's cool.
It's mine.
Baku, does he have the same charm?
Bite!
You have such interesting charms,
but mine is still better.
What? And mine?
Another one?
No.
This grub copies them.
Apple.
Nate Monoma.
The copy charm.
Within five minutes after contact,
he can use this charm.
He is not able to use two at once.
You don't need to have 7.5 in your head to understand.
Bondo, you're getting into a fight.
Monoma, we need to go.
With this score, we have a place in the four leaders.
Follow them.
It's hard.
I can't move.
Wait, calm down.
I'll dissolve everything now.
Faster.
We have no glasses from the word at all.
Oh, just don't be angry at me.
You provoked us first, remember?
What did you say in your speech?
Let me think.
I don't know.
What did you say in your speech?
Let me think.
I don't know.
That's enough for you.
Take a rest.
I will be number one.
Be the first.
I will not only be the first.
I will be the only one in this arena.
One minute left.
Todoroki has prepared the soil.
And he already has 10 million in his pocket.
I thought so five minutes ago.
But Midoriya managed to survive.
In this ice kingdom.
Hold on.
Hold on like this.
He sees you through.
And you go through.
He's holding on to the left side of me.
He bit me.
If I take advantage of the ice now, I can hit Ido.
And if he continues in the same spirit, I will quickly breathe out.
And you, Kayami, can block Kaminari's discharges.
One more minute.
Damn you.
Guys, we have less than a minute.
After that, I will be useless.
I'm counting on you.
Ido?
Hold on tight.
Todoroki, you have to grab her.
Reactive.
Turbo acceleration.
What?
What happened? It was so fast.
Ido, if you could move so fast, why didn't you move during the first round?
What was that?
I can reach the peak speed by accelerating the rotation of my turbines.
But after that, my engines will quickly stall.
It was my secret weapon.
I told you, Midoriya.
This time the victory will be mine.
The situation has changed.
It was a risky escape.
Todoroki gets knocked out by the leaders, and Midoriya is left with nothing.
Follow him.
No chance against Kaminari.
Should I try to knock out the others?
No.
I have no idea about the others.
There is only one option here.
Great.
We will return her deck.
We will definitely return it.
Uraraka?
I will definitely become a hero and make money.
I want my parents to live in wealth.
Exactly.
Maybe we should unite the assets, Mr. Tsargar.
These are not only my glasses.
I trust you with my strength.
And now I am responsible for these three.
And their dreams.
To be continued...
There are less than a minute left.
Todoroki has four ties.
He dropped Midoriya from the first place.
That one was dodging not so much.
Are the four teams going further determined?
The second place?
We overdid it a little.
We just have to wait.
They are afraid to stand.
Stand, I told you.
God, you are so annoying.
You are so annoying.
Bakugan is not the only one.
Tsuburaba.
Blow it up.
Yes.
Tsuburaba Kosei.
A miracle of solid air.
He is able to make the air solid.
His area depends on the volume of the lungs.
Invisible barrier.
All for you.
He took two ties.
With these ties, Bakugan's team breaks out in the top three.
Even now, the intrigue is preserved.
Oh, this young man.
Tsunutori.
Damn.
It's okay.
We haven't lost yet.
Kendo is frozen and can't move.
Yes, while we protect this bandage.
Let's go.
I told you to warn me about this.
But now we can go further.
Not yet.
What?
I didn't come here for this.
Victory or death.
Monova.
The B-class tactics were good.
But he didn't take into account one thing.
I finally got my thoughts in order.
Go ahead.
First, blondie.
Damn.
Eyes to the face, tape.
I'm a Sera, by the way.
Mima.
raccoon eyes.
Splash the solution along the way of our investigation.
My name is Mima Ashido.
Young Bakugan.
You act instinctively.
You know very well, don't you?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
You know very well, don't you?
Those who strive for the top
and those who enjoy the little
are completely different.
He couldn't predict Bakugan's unbearability.
He is merciless.
Bakugan will easily go further.
He is still a perfectionist.
Only a few seconds left.
It's time to find some way.
This is the first time I've used a miracle on a human.
Everything is fine.
I'm not going to beat him.
I'm using the air pressure.
I'll get rid of the opponent's defense.
My left.
What am I doing?
It hurts, but it's not broken.
He turned them inside out to hide the points,
but the 10 million he took
must be on top.
This is it!
Got it?
I got it!
Only 17 seconds left!
Wait a minute.
That's not our flag.
He tricked us.
By the way, we changed the position of the flags.
You were naive, Midoriya.
Then hold your hands in your hands.
Just a little bit more.
Midoriya's team couldn't get their leadership back.
70 points.
That's not enough.
Time is running out.
I'm going to beat him.
Time is running out.
Let's start the countdown.
Takayami!
Kaminari!
Damn it!
Bakugo!
What?
Uraraka!
I got it!
Youruzu!
Where are the 10 million?
I'm going to beat you!
This jerk again!
Time is running out!
The horse race is over!
Bakugo!
Are you okay?
Damn it!
And here are the four best!
First place!
Todoroki's team!
We walked on the blade.
I didn't expect such a victory.
I'm sorry.
I let you down.
It's not like that.
You were our key to success.
Second place!
Bakugo's team!
Damn, that wasn't enough.
Are you sure you're talking about second place?
I'm fine with it.
He's screaming out of happiness, I guess.
Third place!
Tetsute's team!
Wait, what?
Where did Shinsu's team come from?
Where did you get so many points?
Thank you for your help.
Deco?
I'm really sorry.
Really?
After your first attack, Todoroki was obviously worried.
I wanted to get our 10 million back.
Well, we're happy with the small amount.
I grabbed one.
He kept the bandage on his head the least.
Midoriya,
it's all thanks to your last attack.
I like Todoroki.
Fourth place!
In fourth place, Midoriya's team!
First four teams
make it
to the finals!
I'm not going to use the flame anymore.
I promised myself,
but when I was cornered,
I couldn't hold it.
But I'm not going to let my old man down anymore.
Final part!
After lunch break!
We'll hear you again!
Hey, wipe your head.
Let's go have lunch.
I'd better go to sleep.
What happened?
Our glasses just evaporated.
Maybe this is our punishment?
For being so mean.
My bandage is gone!
What the hell?
I lost.
Congratulations, Mina.
Well, I was used as an antifreeze,
if not for Todoroki.
Don't think I'd be in the team.
Hey, you didn't tell me about this super-punch!
It's not fair!
What's going on here?
I just didn't use it.
I wanted to beat Midoriya at any cost.
That's more like it.
By the way, where's Midoriya?
Where are you, Deku?
So, what did you want to talk about?
Yo!
Long time no see.
Come on, let's go have some tea.
All-powerful.
The sequel is coming.
Let's go!
Let's go!
The sports festival of the UAE.
The second round of the first year has come to an end.
To participate in the final competition,
16 heroes were selected.
Izuku Midoriya.
Izuku Midoriya.
Izuku Midoriya.
Izuku Midoriya.
Izuku Midoriya.
Izuku Midoriya.
Izuku Midoriya.
Izuku Midoriya.
Izuku!
I'm so glad you deserve it!
But...
Take care of yourself!
This is the preview.
Midoriya, the All-Powerful is watching you, isn't he?
I try not to think about it,
but I'll beat you.
Todoroki, why did you go so far?
It doesn't matter who you come with.
It's too cold for you.
I have to climb higher than you.
Even if so, I can't lose.
Next, the one who was born with a golden spoon in his mouth.
Class A girls will cheer us up.
Endless limit!
Plus Ultra!
