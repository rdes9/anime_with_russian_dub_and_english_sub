        <pre>Even though not for long, thank you for watching me.
There's nothing to thank me for.
I did everything I had to do.
No, only because of your instructions, new ideas and sparring.
I managed to resist the hero killer.
Ouch, it hurts!
Against a hero killer who wasn't serious.
Well, I think it's still better than if you put 100% of your strength into a blow.
And then you missed.
Only your hand got hurt. Am I right?
In the last moment you crossed the threshold of 5%.
You still have a lot to learn.
After all, you easily lose control over yourself.
You have to keep your mind clear.
I'm sure you already know that.
But if you want to become great like the Almighty, then you still have a long way to go.
Yes!
Okay, see you later, Shket.
Uh, can I ask you one more question?
I couldn't pick a moment.
And I thought it would be rude on my part.
Come on, I want to eat my teyaki.
Knowing that you are very strong and even trained the Almighty,
I can't understand why the name of Grant Arina is unknown to anyone.
Is there a reason for this?
Ah, well, that's because there's nothing interesting in the work of a hero.
What?
I had a goal, and for its achievement, I had to use my reason freely.
That's why I got a license.
You should hear this story from Toshi.
That is, from the Almighty.
You will hear more from him.
The Almighty?
That's all. Bye, kid.
Yes!
Thank you and sorry for everything.
The greatest hero, huh?
You are completely different from him.
Both outside and inside.
And yet he is the same as you are, Shinori.
The guy chosen by my best friend.
And the one who was chosen by the heir of one for all.
Guy!
And who are you going to be, huh?
Again?
I'm Izuku Midoriya.
What?
I don't know them.
Deku!
Let's watch him together, Shinori.
Until the day he becomes a legend.
Until the moment Deku's name is not a symbol of the world.

He's back!
Wow, you had to fight the villains?
I'm so jealous of you!
I just helped evacuate people.
So I didn't participate in the battle.
But it's still cool!
Well, I just did what I did, I went to patrol.
I also participated in the capture of the smugglers from the neighboring country.
It's so cool!
And what about you, Ochako?
How was the week?
Very informative.
Ochako woke up again?
She was an intern at a war hero?
Such changes in just one week.
Changes?
It's not like that, Kaminaru.
All the women are devils.
They just hide their true essence.
What have you been through, Lady of the Mountain?
I had a good time.
But those who changed the most,
these three.
Yes, yes, the killer of the heroes!
I'm glad you guys got out of there alive.
I was very worried too.
I heard that you were saved by a laborer.
That's cool!
What was expected from hero number two.
Yes, he saved us.
Yeah.
I saw in the news that the killer of the heroes was associated with the League of Villains.
I was shocked by one thought that he could attack us in the park.
Ojiro, you saw that video, didn't you?
He was so scary.
Video? Are you talking about the killer of the heroes?
Yes.
His will was unwavering, and the ideals were clearly formulated.
I thought he was really cool.
Kaminaru!
What?
Oh, sorry.
No, it's okay.
He was a man of strong beliefs.
And I understand why many people think he's cool.
But he chose Karo as his tool.
It doesn't matter what he thinks.
It's impossible to justify this part.
And in order not to let people fall into the abyss of despair...
I'll go my way, hero!
I'm Ayumu!
Oh, Ida!
Ida, the lesson will start soon!
Take your places!
He's so loud.
It's all because you've messed him up, Kaminaru.
Yeah, my bad.
Until I become a real hero,
my left hand will remain like this.
You're cool, Ida.
Ida-kun!
So, I'm here.
Well, it's time to start.
We'll have a basic hero training.
Long time no see, boys and girls.
How are you doing?
This time the training will be difficult.
Since you've just returned from the internship,
we've decided to make you happy with a life-saving sprint.
And these competitions
are not supposed to be held in the USG complex.
Oh, this complex is intended for a new kind of training.
Do you remember what I was talking about?
Yes!
I was talking about the sprint.
It's the gamma training field
where the factory buildings form a kind of labyrinth.
Form a group of five people.
The sprint will be held for each group separately.
When I give a signal for help,
you can all start your run to the center.
You have to find out who will save me first.
The damage to the structure needs to be reduced to a minimum.
Stop poking at me.
Okay, the first group, get in position.
Iida hasn't fully recovered yet.
He shouldn't participate.
The most mobile class representatives are gathered in this group.
It seems that Midoriya is in an unfavorable position.
Yes, to be honest, I still don't know.
And each of his actions ends with a terrible injury.
What do you think, who will win?
I think Sarah will be the first.
But Odger shouldn't fall behind either.
I think it will be Ashido.
She is in very good shape.
Deku will be the last.
I still think it will be Ida,
even if he is not in the best shape.
Okay, let's get started.
Start!
Did you see that?
In such places, it is necessary to gain height.
And that means that Sarah is in the best shape.
This place is really made for me.
I'm going to be the first.
I'm going to be the first.
I'm going to be the first.
I'm going to be the first.
I'm going to be the first.
I'm going to be the first.
This is just the perfect training.
Wow! Midoriya!
What about his movements?
It can't be!
If you look closely, then these movements ...
Wow!
He jumps just like ...
These are my movements!
While I was doing my internship.
He again.
Midoriya is jumping?
His bones have already grown?
Calm down.
I can do it.
Calm down, don't cross the line.
Be focused and calm.
What?
Finish!
Thank you and congratulations!
Thank you!
Midoriya, how are you?
Are you okay?
I just landed on an unstable surface.
I still have to take into account the landing site.
I still have a lot to learn.
Yuneser is the first again.
But if you compare it to the beginning of the year, then your control of your senses has improved.
Continue in the same spirit and prepare for the final exam.
Yes, sir!
The first group can leave the obstacle lane.
The second group is on the start.
You surprised me.
I didn't believe my eyes.
When the class is over, come to me.
Yes.
The time has come and I have to tell you.
About me and one of them all.
Sounded with the support of Jump Club.
The site of the group is in VK.com.
And also subscribe to the channel on Twitch.
Yes, training was what I needed.
For the first time in my training, I lost weight.
I have to work on my mobility.
You need to collect more information about the location.
Then I will have to be at the tail.
I envy guys like you and Yuneser.
I wonder what he wanted.
It's a little scary.
Hey, Midoriya.
Look what I found.
Here, here.
Look at the poster as in the run from Shoushenko.
Apparently this is the legacy of the predecessors.
There behind the wall.
Well, you know.
Women's locker room.
Enough of Mineta.
Viewing is prohibited.
The existence of my little Mineta is also prohibited.
Yauyu Rose melons.
Taliashino.
Flying panties of Hagakura.
Juicy body of Uraraki.
Asui.
And her surprisingly big boobs.
Magiro headphones.
Strength and accuracy in the cup give a great offensive potential.
Thank you, Kyouko.
What a jerk.
Let's do it ourselves.
He didn't say anything about me.
My eye.
My beautiful eye.
Let me in.
Sit down.
He has changed.
You had to go through a lot.
I'm sorry I wasn't there.
You have nothing to apologize for, all-powerful.
What really matters is what you meant by the history of your miracle.
I heard that the killer of the hero licked a drop of your blood.
Yes, that's right.
His miracle paralyzes a person if he drinks his blood.
But what is it for?
Remember what I told you when I transferred my strength?
Will you eat it?
No, not this.
I said that my DNA should be eaten for transfer.
Just don't say that the killer of the heroes now has one for all.
No, that's not true.
I thought you could worry about this, but it looks like you forgot everything.
One for all is not transferred to another person until the carrier wishes for it.
You can't take him by force, but you can forcefully transfer something in the spirit.
It's just a gift and nothing more.
Where are you from?
This is a special miracle.
And its origin is appropriate.
One for all came from one miracle that existed in the past.
A miracle that existed in the past?
And the name of this miracle is all for one.
The ability that allowed people to master miracles and transfer them to other people.
All for one person?
It all started when miracles only began to appear, and society was not yet ready to change.
With the appearance of the miracle, the concept of a normal person suddenly began to crack.
The law ceased to have power.
Civilization ceased to progress.
The world turned to hell.
If there were no superpowers, we would have already conquered the stars.
Someone very famous said that.
You're right.
It was at this time that the one who united people appeared.
I'm sure you've heard about him.
He took the miracle and, gaining power, his influence spread.
He controlled people like pawns.
They did everything he wanted.
Very soon he became the leader of all the villains, and then crushed Japan under himself.
I've read about something like this on the Internet.
Isn't this an invention?
This is not written in history books.
History silences the fact of the existence of such individuals.
If a person gains power, he is looking for a place where he could use it.
But how is this connected with one for all?
I already said that all for one could transmit miracles, right?
He gave power to those whom he trusted and forced to obey.
Only the human body is not always able to withstand several miracles.
And if it does not withstand, then the person becomes a free doll, just like a gnome.
But there were also those whose miracles were mixed and mutated into something bigger.
He had an incredible younger brother.
He was weak and sick, but he had a strong sense of justice.
It was painful for him to look at his older brother, and he resisted him.
He forcibly passed a miracle to his younger brother, which can accumulate power.
Did he do it out of kindness, or did he want to be subdued unknowingly?
It can't be!
It was considered a miracle, but there was still power in it.
The power that neither the surroundings nor he himself could notice.
He had a useless miracle that could transmit itself to another.
And in the end, these two miracles were mixed.
This is the mystery of the origin of one for all.
How ironic.
Justice always comes from evil.
Wait!
I understood how it appeared!
But what about that villain from the past?
Why is that now?
He can take other people's miracles.
He needed the one that would allow him not to grow old.
So he had to steal such an immortal symbol of evil.
With the difference in power and in the existing social order,
the defeated younger brother decided to entrust his miracle to the future generations.
He believed that his power would accumulate, and one day it would be enough to defeat his older brother.
And I was the one who did it.
That's what it seemed to me.
But he survived and began to act again.
But this time he leads the villainous alliance.
One for all.
It is intended to defeat everyone for one.
One day you will have to face the great evil.
I'm afraid it's too much for you, Noah.
I'm ready for anything!
I'll do anything you ask me to do!
As long as you're here, I can do anything!
I feel it!
Tell him, Almighty,
you have to.
Everything is wrong, young Midoriya.
I...
Thank you.
I'm sorry, Midoriya, my boy.
Most likely, I...
...won't be able to be by your side that day.
To be continued!
To be continued!
To be continued!
So, the summer vacation is over.
But we can't let you rest for a whole month.
Just don't say it!
During the summer vacation, you will go to the summer camp.
I knew it!
Hooray!

What the hell?
Girls, do your best!
The All-Powerful told me about very important things.
But my life hasn't changed at all.
And what could have changed?
But why didn't the All-Powerful tell anything about himself?
He didn't say anything about himself.
The Killer of the Heroes
I didn't think he would be enough.
And so everything went as I expected.
Those who want chaos and those who share his interests
and choose the League of Villains as a guide to fulfill their wishes,
the Tumor of Shigaraki will become their connecting link.
It seems to me that if you interfered, things would have gone much faster.
Well, if so, quickly cure me, doctor.
I would have had hyperregeneration five years ago.
And now it is useless, because my wounds have been tightened.
The leader of the Alliance of Villains?
I wonder if he is capable of doing this.
Everything is going as it should.
I put him in such a position to raise my successor in him.
He was born for this.
You can rejoice, All-Powerful.
Rejoice in this fleeting world.
And here is the preview.
The last exam has already begun.
How would you know what would happen on the practical test?
Not a joke, it seems that we will fight against robots again.
And it will be easy.
Pasha, yes, I think the task will be changed.
Yeah, the students are divided into pairs.
And they fight against the teacher?
Against the pro?
What the hell, we can't beat them.
Next, preparation for the final exam.
It seems that I have problems with the theoretical part.
Infinity is not the limit.
Plus Ultra!
