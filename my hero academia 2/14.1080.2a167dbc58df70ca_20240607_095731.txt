Do you want it or not, but you will have to go through the heroic practice.
You received an offer from the internship.
The name of the person who invited you is Grant Arina.
He was a U.A. teacher for about a year.
And he was my class leader.
My name is Midori Aizuku.
I'm from U.A.
Nice to meet you.
Dead!
Actually, I'm alive.
He's alive!
Dead!
Dead!
The End
Oh my god!
I dropped a sausage with ketchup and fell down.
I easily believed in his death.
Who are you?
I'm Izuku Midori from U.A.
What are you saying?
I'm Izuku Midori.
Who is he?
Damn it!
He's a teacher of the Almighty.
I knew he was far from a hammer.
But not so much.
I want to eat something.
Eat?
Oh, it's Shinori.
No, that's not my name.
I'm sorry, I have to go and make a call.
I need to tell the Almighty about the condition of his grandfather.
What are you doing?
I'm not the only one who uses it.
I need to understand how well you control it.
What happened to him suddenly?
Oh, not a bad costume.
Put it on and act.
It's...
Who are you?
It's all very bad.
I need to hurry.
And in the shortest time I can learn to control my magic.
The Almighty has not so much time left.
That's why I don't have time to deal with you.
I'm sorry.
Well, then...
Oh, no!
Oh, no!
Come on, you need to show me your power, you coward!
Episode 27. The Appearance of the Great Grand Arena.
I've been watching the sports festival on TV.
You used your power so senselessly.
And he is called the strongest and symbol of the world, but as a teacher, he is just awful.
Well, boys, maybe we'll start?
He uses the same phrases.
There can be no doubt. This is the teacher of the Almighty.
It hurts to look at how you use one of them all.
I'll teach you everything.
Well, now put on the costume.
I'm all excited.
Instruction. Dear Izuku Midoriya.
Repairing your costume, our team decided to change its design and structure.
We hope you understand.
Now he's even cooler.
They made corrections without my consent.
I wonder if everyone is doing their business like Hatsume.
It's time to test the costume that my mother sewed.
I'm ready.
Well, then attack.
Can I really?
I still don't know how to use them.
There's nowhere to turn here.
There may be a fire or something worse.
Your body may not stand it.
You're so talkative.
I'm starting to get out of myself.
We're going to fight here.
You haven't felt my real power yet.
I can't believe that the ninth carrier of one of them all turned out to be so green.
The Almighty is still so helpless.
He's too fast.
What kind of a miracle does he have?
No, it's not like that.
In a situation where there is no shelter and opportunities to escape,
instead of following his movements, I just have to stop him.
The costume.
The main thing is not to break it.
You can't let that happen.
He's already passed me twice.
Then?
You analyze and you guess.
Strike!
Oh, you're too stuck.
You're too focused on the outsider.
That's why it all ended like that.
I thought it was enough.
Like I said,
the way you used one of them all at the tournament,
you should have already understood.
But your sense of respect for the Almighty
and your sense of duty
is like a chain.
A chain?
Yes, you need to get stronger.
But your enemies won't wait for your transformation.
One of them is nothing special.
And what am I supposed to do?
You'll have to find out for yourself.
I'll go get some food.
And you stay here.
What?
My admiration for the Almighty
has become my shield.
We often just wait for a call from a client,
but lately the host has been restless.
The street patrols are called to detain criminals.
That's right.
I can't believe the younger brother of Ingenium
came to my agency.
I'm sure you got an invitation
from the more famous heroes.
A hero's killer.
So far and so close,
but still unreachable.
Maybe I'm doing it in vain,
but even so.
My brother will be exiled.
I can't forgive him.
I see.
So you attacked him.
And you want me to become one of you?
Yes, you have a lot of experience
in the criminal business.
What's your goal?
To kill the Almighty first.
Actually, I want to destroy everything
that I don't like.
Including these little bastards.
I was a fool.
If you could get me interested in it.
Most of all, I hate people like you.
Do you want me to stoop to your childish tricks?
What's the point of crushing everyone
without an analysis?
The hero's killer, Stein.
You brought this man here
to provide the host
with the desire to destroy
the tomb of Ushigaraki Rostam.
However, this...
Master, should I stop them?
It's all right.
If I tell him everything,
it won't make sense.
He still has to grow above himself.
Motivate him.
That's what it means to train.
My respect for the Almighty
has turned into a spear.
Even knowing this,
my head is a mess.
I thought of one of them
as something special.
And it's stinging me.
How do you even understand
that it's stinging me?
What can make me more flexible?
Flexible?
I got it!
I thought of my pritchard
as a special move or strike.
I saw it up close,
but I didn't notice it before.
It's all right.
It's a part of my body.
I have to perceive it easier.
It was all on the surface.
He has a deep mind.
I realized that at the sports festival.
You found yourself a worthy prey.
Isn't that right, Toshinori?
Isn't that right, Almighty?
Sounded by Gem Club.
VK.com, VK.com, GemFans.
Let's be honest.
I don't like you.
What?
You chose my agency
only because
I'm one of the five best heroes.
I don't know anything.
I got an invitation.
I always invited good students.
We haven't had anyone like you for a long time.
I watched you at the festival.
You mastered your pritchard well.
And you use it as a pro.
You are incredibly talented
and ready for the full-fledged work of a hero.
But you have one fatal flaw.
You believe that you are the strongest
and you try to prove it with all your might.
You have an unusual character.
Uncle, I didn't come here
for sweet things.
To deal with a scoundrel like you
is part of my heroic duties.
A villain and a hero are two sides of the same coin.
I'll show you
what a hero does to a hero.
What's going on?
Isn't it obvious?
I make an exemplary hero out of you.
As you say,
you look,
express emotions,
moral values.
There is a lot to be done
in this week.
I'll beat you up
with all this.
Tetsu-Tetsu!
Kirishima!
Why are you here?
We were able to take you both.
Let's get rid of the ghost.
Attention!
I saw your battle at the sports festival.
I like you.
There are nuances in our work,
so don't rely on pure strength.
I'll teach you
all the subtleties of the heroic craft.
Didn't expect less from you?
So brave!
I'm not done yet!
I'm sorry.
I'll teach you in a good manner too.
Thank you!
But first I'll tell you
that professionals get a salary
from the state,
being civil servants,
but there are also its features.
Therefore, we are a little different
from ordinary clerks.
As for our duties...
We mainly patrol the streets.
If something happens,
we immediately run to the scene.
We can survive anywhere.
We, in short,
provide information about our activities
to the government departments
and get paid for the work done.
Something like that.
He has such a cute accent.
Heroes are allowed to work.
When it was legalized,
it caused a violent reaction.
But everything worked out
because of our popularity
and needs in our services.
Now I'm shooting in advertising.
Don't go too far.
I hoped to get more
practical experience.
You can't avoid it
even if you want to become a professional.
She still complained about me.
I'm absorbing all her experience.
She will give her all.
We can only watch you.
Do you know why I chose you?
Well, because
we have the same qualifications.
Yes, but it's not that easy.
That's not all.
You're just cute.
The hero must always be ready.
Especially when he's on patrol.
Yes,
it's harder than practice in class.
The hero must be able to entertain himself
when he has nothing to do.
Got it?
Yes, yes.
Am I a maid?
Yes, you are.
I've been waiting for you, Shota.
Have you decided
to follow the path of greatness?
I'm not going to follow
the path of greatness.
I'll go my own way.
Well,
get ready.
We're moving out.
Where?
I'll show you
what a hero's life is like.
Day one. Night.
Z! Z!
He's asleep, isn't he?
He checked me on the first day.
There was nothing
about the hero's activities.
He fell asleep right after
he came back from the store.
Grant Arena.
I didn't find any information about him.
He was a U.A. teacher.
His identity is hidden.
I have to accept
everything and think about it
as my own wonder.
For a coach, using a wonder
is something natural.
I still can't act intuitively.
If I could use at least
5% of it,
I could easily do something similar.
Aizawa and Kirishima
told me about it.
If I own my wonder,
there will be nothing impossible.
First, I have to learn to act instinctively.
Okay, it's just a matter of time.
Even with 5%,
it won't be a problem.
I just have to jump and push back.
It should work.
I have to control it.
But it was expected.
Kirishima!
I have to control my legs
and not forget about my arms.
It means that for the second jump
I have to do both arms and legs.
A momentary delay
and everything can end badly.
I don't have time
to think for a long time.
Okay, one more time!
I have to strengthen my arms!
I have to act faster!
Faster!
Even faster!
What's that?
Let's go!
It's some kind of a psycho!
Yeah.
Come on!
Good morning!
How are you?
I've been praying too much
with self-development.
I tried to digest everything
but it didn't work.
I still have to learn and learn.
It's not wise.
It's the most difficult thing.
I'm not your assistant.
The Almighty had a different approach.
He could use
the power of the very beginning.
His trainings were special.
In general, I had to
understand his body.
The school life of the Almighty?
How did it happen?
Oh, that.
I would call it
the education of the postpartan.
That's why he's afraid of him.
I didn't have the right
to be inferior
because my late friend
entrusted me with it.
Has the Almighty's predecessor
died?
Huh?
Delivery!
I'll open it.
So you didn't tell him
about the seventh successor,
Toshinori.
Thank you for your work!
A micro-vibration?
Well, the previous one broke
under unknown circumstances.
I ordered a new one.
Okay, let's warm up the taiyaki.
I didn't buy them in vain.
Let's go.
Taiyaki for breakfast?
I like sweets.
Use one of them instinctively.
Roughly speaking,
I have to catch the essence of the miracle
that others have been training for more than 15 years.
Time doesn't wait for anyone.
I have to learn to control
5% of my strength
and keep training.
Oh, the most delicious!
Pour it while it's hot!
My time is limited.
What should I do?
What's wrong, kid?
Just have a meal of delicious
hot taiyaki and...
Oh, it's icy!
How? It can't be!
I warmed them up in the microwave!
Are you crazy?
You warmed up everything on a big plate!
If you load it like that,
it won't rotate and only one side will warm up.
Are you crazy?
You haven't used the equipment for a long time.
Oh, well, ours never rotated at all.
I'm sorry.
Here it is!
Grand Arena!
This...
This taiyaki!
It's me!
Are you crazy or what?
No, I didn't mean that!
I finally got it!
Until today, I was busy
using my magic.
Only when I needed it.
As if pulling the lever.
And my reaction
was slowly slowing down.
After all, I had to distract myself.
I had to activate it from the very beginning.
I can imagine the warmth
all over my body!
You're an exemplary boy.
All over my body
and continuously
to the upper limit of 5%!
It's very boring
to imagine the microwave, isn't it?
All-powerful!
It's all right!
Can you move?
I don't know.
Do you want to try?
Yes!
Of course!
Let's continue.
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
The moment have come
to say the saying!
Shigaraki Tomura?!
You have been�
I don't have anything left.
Now this is my section until the end of the season.
All-powerful, help me!
Next, Midoriya and Shigaraki.
The League of Villains is ready to cling to your throat.
I will defeat everyone.
Be it a hero or a killer of heroes.
Go away!
I don't want to.
Please!
No.
