        <pre>My movements!
While I was playing around with the door,
while I was doing my internship,
again,
I don't know
if you were able to master your magic,
but you chose your opponent by accident.
I don't need a half-finished result,
like at a sports festival.
For future festivals,
our skills will be evaluated,
and we will find out who is the best of us.
My victory will be unconditional,
and I will beat you.
I won't forget
the time we were together.
I will decorate my dreams
with my regrets,
with my regrets,
with my regrets,
with my regrets,
with my regrets,
with my regrets,
with my regrets,
with my regrets,
with my regrets,
with my regrets,
with my regrets.
We're in the same team.
I have to say...
Kachan!
During the exam, we have to face the teachers.
So we have to figure out if we should run or fight.
In our case, fighting is pointless, since our opponent is the All-Powerful.
I think it's a bad idea.
Wait, Kachan!
Stop chasing me!
If we keep going the same way, we'll meet the All-Powerful.
We have to go the other way.
Why do we have to run?
It'll only be better if we beat him right away.
We shouldn't get into an open confrontation.
We're going to beat him.
And then we're going to make a decisive blow.
It's still hard for us to communicate with Kachan.
But now I have to think about something else.
Do you even understand who the All-Powerful is?
Even with the All-Powerful, he's invincible!
Just shut up.
It's all good now, but no one allowed you to talk.
It annoys me.
Teamwork doesn't smell good here.
Do they even know who their opponent is?
What?
Well...
It's time to get started.
Wait, Kachan!
I'm saying this because I want us to pass the test.
Kachan, listen to me!
I told you I didn't need you!
Stop yelling!
That's why we can't talk normally.
Who cares about the integrity of the city?
What was that?
What the hell?
What kind of fear is that?
If you thought of the battle as an exam,
I'd be sorry.
I'm angry with you.
I'm angry with you.
I'm angry with you.
I'm angry with you.
Poor you.
I'm the villain.
Come on!
Show me your best.
You're not thinking as straight, and now you need to go!
And show me the rest!
Kachan!
Speedable grenade!
surplus,éŒ¯
If you didn't do it, then I'd be happy to do it anyway!
If I grab someone by the face, the enemy tries to take my hand away.
But this guy really wants to beat me.
With such weak blows, he can only dream about it.
And now...
You are no exception, young Midoriya.
Are you throwing an ally and trying to get away?
Why did I immediately remember the killer of the heroes?
That's how it's not done.
Get out of the way!
One wants to defeat the Almighty.
The other only thinks about running away.
The latter are most likely to admire them too much.
For Midoriya Izuku, the Almighty is like a god.
On the other hand, I don't know this boy well.
His grades and sports festival showed that he is incredibly talented.
I don't understand why he is in such a hurry.
Kachan!
On the way.
I told you not to get along with him.
Shut up.
I will win.
This is what it means to be a hero.
Wow!
The Almighty is so cool!
Then you should run away.
Let me go.
Don't touch me.
Yeah, here's a present for those who want to run away.
Kachan!
Look!
Did you see that?
The Almighty is just incredibly strong.
You thought he wouldn't stand up against the four of them, didn't you?
See?
See?
He could.
He dodged, then hit.
Or it was a trick, and then BAM!
See?
He won.
It doesn't matter what kind of drag he got into.
It doesn't matter what kind of drag he got into.
It doesn't matter what kind of drag he got into.
It doesn't matter what kind of drag he got into.
Victory is always after him.
You're such an idiot.
But you're right.
It doesn't matter what, but you're always...
You're always trying to win.
And I admire you for that.
I know the reason for your anger.
It's because of the rampant growth of the young Midoriya.
But you know that the growth rate of characters
level 1 and 50 isn't equal.
You have potential for growth.
You understand that, don't you?
See?
You still have a place to grow.
And I'm not talking about strength.
Shut up, Almighty.
If I get help from this waste...
If I get help from this waste...
I'd rather lose.
I see.
Well, don't regret it later.
Damn it!
Don't even try to yell!
Don't even try to yell!
I didn't think the young Midoriya would get in the way.
I've weakened my defense.
And these iron bars are damn heavy.
You bastard, put me down!
It's okay.
I told you to let me go!
Kachan.
I don't think we can really beat the Almighty.
Don't even think about running away.
What?
But before you give up, try to work with me.
Don't say you agree with the defeat.
You, it's you only because you never give up.
It's you, isn't it?
You're just a freshman.
You should apologize to the seniors.
We'll tell everything to Yuchan.
And he's super strong.
We'll remind you of that tomorrow.
I didn't do anything.
It was you who hit me.
Cool, Kachan.
You fought with two fours and won.
The coolest hero always wins.
Always wins.
You've been saying that since you were a kid.
And how can you give up?
Kachan.
I won't repeat it twice, you bastard.
You can't run away and hide against his crazy speed.
And you can't avoid a fight here.
But we have no chance in the battle.
Only not with the Almighty.
Shut up or I'll kill you.
I'll kill you.
He doesn't want to move with his power.
I thought about it before.
So...
Where's the young Midoriya?
He's nowhere to be seen.
Does that mean he's headed to the exit?
Where are you looking at?
Behind, then.
You're pissing me off.
Who would cooperate?
With someone like you.
Daku!
We'll show him everything we've got.
We have to get rid of him and then retreat.
I got it.
Go!
I'm sorry, Almighty.
My shoulder.
My shoulder!
Kachan.
And you're using this on a regular basis?
Idiot, run!
Yeah!
Don't you dare try to stop me!
I'm telling you!
Yeah, they caught me.
Something in between the fight and the escape.
Pretty good for improvisation.
They also led to no damage in the city.
I'm fighting where I've already destroyed everything.
I think I taught them that during the first fight.
There you go.
They're both smart enough.
But if they're together, it all goes to hell.
Envy.
Hatred.
Pursuit.
Poverty.
Rejection.
Pride.
From what I've heard,
they both have different opinions about each other.
And they can't cooperate anymore.
You can't fix that with an ambulance.
But I'm sure that their efforts today
will bring them a huge result in the future.
All right, then.
Your teacher will show you what he's made of.
Sounded with the support of the Gym Club.
The goal of the VK group is vk.com slash gymfans.
And subscribe to the Twitch channel, twitch.tv slash gym club.
We're almost there.
Almost at the gate.
They look kind of weird.
But if one of us gets past them, we'll win.
Damn, we ran into him somewhere in the middle of the way, didn't we?
What the hell?
It doesn't look like the All-Powerful is following us.
Just don't tell me that we knocked him out.
Didn't you say that he's invincible, didn't you?
We wouldn't have knocked him out anyway.
When he catches up with us,
I'll have to use the second glove.
Yeah, yeah.
What's next?
Why are you so surprised?
He's too fast.
Considering the weight of the load,
my speed was unparalleled.
Well, now it's time to die, hero.
Who are you talking to?
Awesome, boys.
You united and met me in a single front.
However, the two of you...
...were determined to be a pair.
What an incredible speed.
His endurance and power are also incredible.
It's pure physical strength.
I remember fighting him.
And it's true...
...that he's the greatest man in the world.
The strongest hero.
Damn it.
What's wrong, young Midoriya?
You decided to avoid using the maximum firepower
after going through the gate.
It was a decent plan.
But now the gloves of the young Obaku are destroyed.
So is your maximum firepower.
It's over.
Shut up!
Damn it.
I'll send you on a flight.
I don't like it.
But this is the only way to win.
Wait!
Die!
Die?
Are you serious, Kachan?
But for now, my goal is the almighty air.
The goal is...
I'm taking a Hampshire blow.
As much as I can.
Don't be so naive, heroes.
With gloves, I could use a miracle
without the risk of health.
It was so stupid on my part.
After all, you can only win the almighty
by putting everything you have on the computer.
An explosion like at a sports festival.
Again.
Run!
Deco, faster!
My spine!
I can still move.
Are you tired already?
Move, damn it!
I will move, overcoming pain.
If I go to the gates,
the almighty will try to intercept me.
It will be an advantage for Kachan.
It's time, young Bakugan.
I'm sorry,
but as a teacher,
I can't let you risk your health.
Faster!
Run!
Damn it!
I'm breaking.
And I will continue to break myself.
I'm ready to step over the wall.
I'm ready.
I will not accept the fact
that you are invincible.
Never!
Kachan!
I won't let you!
In times when you are scared or anxious,
you need to meet with a smile on your face.
Step back.
The almighty will try to stop you.
Step back!
The almighty!
Hit!
Yanya!
It seems he is unconscious.
I'm sorry, Kachan.
I'm such a human.
He managed to pass through the gates.
He hit me with all his might.
Probably.
You were like this from the very beginning.
You can't do anything.
You save those who need help.
And in times of need,
there is no wall that can hold you back.
Yes,
this is the warmth of people
that I belong to.
The Bakugo team has passed.
The practical part of Class 1A has been completed.
Kisses.
Thank you very much.
The almighty, can't you hold yourself back at all?
If you hit harder, I wouldn't be able to cure them.
Especially Midori's back.
It's in a terrible state.
Bakugo will be sleeping for some time.
You two need to rest.
Got it.
Thank you.
You've gotten stronger since our first meeting.
I hardly recognize you, Midori.
And this young man too.
Young Bakugo.
You were able to smile in front of the wall of crime.
Yes.
I'm sure you can both become even stronger.
A lot has happened.
Some have learned their weaknesses,
and took a new step towards tomorrow.
Others realized that they needed a hero.
Some were hindered by the high walls.
Some realized their own joy.
And some moved on to their dreams.
With such mixed feelings, our exams are over.
Tomura Shigaraki.
Shigaraki Tomura.
Are you interested in these boys, Midori and Izuku?
Shigaraki-san.
They've been talking about you lately.
I heard you're preparing something big.
Who are they?
They are...
Who are they?
They are...
So it's you.
I saw you on the photo, but I didn't think you were such a freak.
Wow, assistant.
Are you a friend of the Great Stein's pie?
I want to join you too.
To the League of Villains.
They started acting again.
And every time they go up, they come back even stronger.
To be continued.
To be continued.
To be continued.
To be continued.
To be continued.
To be continued.
To be continued.
To be continued.
To be continued.
To be continued.
To be continued.
To be continued.
To be continued.
To be continued.
To be continued.
And here's a preview.
I met someone when I went to the mall with everyone.
Tell me his name.
It was...
Tom Roshigaraki.
What's the difference between me and the killer and the hero?
Aren't our goals the same?
But all the looks are directed at him, not at me.
Tell me why, Midoriya.
Next meeting.
Yeah, I think I get it.
It's all the Almighty's fault.
Infinity is the limit, plus Ultra!
