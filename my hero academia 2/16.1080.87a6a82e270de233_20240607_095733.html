There's no need to regret
It's a must, it's a must
To the bright future that's already been cut off
Please calm down
Take your seats
The danger has passed
We are waiting for the arrival of the heroes
Excuse me
I'm leaving
Hey, wait, it's dangerous
They look different
But their similarity is obvious
It could be Brother No
But why is he here?
I don't have time for this
I have to show what I've learned
One for all
Full coverage
Everything's fine, I can handle it
GranTarino
I hope everything's going to be fine
Episode 29
Hero killer vs. UA students
It's a villain!
Where are the heroes?
How old am I?
How old have I not fought with such a demand?
You should be put in your legal place
I will not allow you to disobey
He's fast, but...
And I'm not a finger
He attacks without a fight
Stop it, you're small
I was looking for a hero killer
But this bug was on my way
I don't know you, old man
But let me figure it out
Are you kidding me?
Why are you here?
Isn't it obvious?
Because I'm a hero
Most likely, people are running from danger
But what about the creature that looked like Nomo?
If it has the power comparable to the power of Nomo...
Not only GranTarino, but the whole city is in danger
Ida is working here
I have to help him
What should I do?
Think...
What are my further actions?
Tenya!
Tenya!
What...?
I can't believe it
what is going on here?
Manual, the fire flags
Got it
This voice
He's a hero
and he has Sir Citness
This is his Stajeroid Cid!
Tanya, why did you disappear at such a moment?
He disappeared? At this time?
Is our Cid capable of such a thing?
Hey, guy, run away!
Go away!
I'm sorry!
We will detain them!
And you should have done your legs!
Where is Tanya?
This can not be!
He would never have escaped in such a situation!
Hussu is a creature that looks like Nomu.
Ida and Hussu are the killers of the heroes.
Just do not tell me!
What the hell is wrong with these guys?
What kind of power is this?
Take care!
Well, we got caught!
What do they need?
These monsters!
Nomu is just great!
Are you going to take part in the battle?
Are you stupid?
I'm wounded.
That's why I captured these big guys.
Master, how many Nomu are ready for battle?
They are not as strong as our first experimental sample.
And now I have six.
Give them to me.
Why?
Because I do not trust the killers of the heroes.
I can destroy the unwanted.
Right, Master?
You are absolutely right.
However, now I can give you only three.
I hope you will learn a lot.
With the first rays of the sun, the world will forget about you!
Killer of the heroes!
A child in a suit.
Who are you?
I am the younger brother of the hero you attacked.
The younger brother of my idol.
I came to stop you.
Will you take my name?
You will remember me until the end of your miserable life.
Gengenium!
This is the hero who will punish you!
I see.
Well, now die.
You're done!
So he had a brother.
I left him alive to spread rumors.
You are weak.
And you are weak.
You are both weak.
Because you are a fake.
Shut up!
All his lower part is paralyzed because of the spine injury.
He can no longer be a hero.
Tensei saved a lot of people.
And he led a lot of people.
And now...
You had no reason to do this to him.
Tensei, I'm proud of you.
You became independent at such a young age.
You had so many followers.
He never took the easy way.
Father, they are not my followers.
It's the other way around.
I'm powerless without their support.
I have to work hard to gain their trust.
I'm not very talented.
But I shouldn't disgrace our family and my name.
I'm glad I can help so many people.
He became a hero for me.
He was a great hero.
He gave me a dream.
I won't forgive you.
I'll kill you.
First, save him.
Before you take care of your skin, save others.
Don't take advantage of it for personal purposes.
When you were angry, you wanted to satisfy your egoistic desires.
That's why you went as far as possible from the high rank of the hero.
That's why you're going to die here.
I can't move.
Goodbye.
You will become a brick that I lay at the foundation of the best world.
Shut your mouth!
Wow, you admire me?
Ida, so I'm not that hopeless.
It doesn't matter what you say.
You're still the villain who hurt my brother.
Hit!
Mi...
Midoriya?
I came to save you, Ida.
Ida!
I thought a lot about it.
And there is no proof of my theory.
But it doesn't matter anymore.
After all, I can't stop.
In the city where the killer of the heroes appeared, the confrontation with NOMO began.
And only I realize the complexity of the situation.
The League of Villains and the killer of the heroes are somehow connected.
Doesn't it mean that the killer of the heroes is also in the city?
Ida didn't fight at the front line, and that means he found the killer of the heroes.
Bingo!
This guy...
He was in one of the pictures in Shigaraki.
Midoriya, why?
They said on TV that 60% of the victims of the killer of the heroes were found in deserted places.
And that's why I started to comb the outskirts near the Heroic agencies.
I had to check each of them.
Can you move?
We need to get out of here.
We need to get out of here.
We can't help you.
I can't.
My body is forged.
From the moment he stabbed me.
Most likely, this is his trick.
As expected on TV.
He activates his trick through stabbing?
There's someone else there.
If only Ida was here, I could have taken him out.
Midoriya, don't get involved.
You can't handle him.
What are you talking about?
Your friend came to save you.
Isn't that nice?
But I have to kill this boy.
And if you get into a fight, then of course you can survive.
What do you say to that?
The killer's eyes sparkle with a weak white flame.
He's different from those who attacked the USG.
These are the killer's eyes.
I have no proof.
Even if it's just an assumption.
I have to do everything to make them believe me.
I'll protect these two.
And I'll win enough time.
And I'll distract the killer.
Enough!
Go away.
I told you.
These are just my arguments.
It's none of your business.
If everything is as you say, then the heroes are just useless.
There are a lot of things I would like to talk about.
But we still have time.
Even the Almighty told me.
Stabbing someone else's business is the basis of the hero's profession.
What?
Great.
I'll shorten the distance.
I'm defenseless at short distances.
A wise decision.
No!
If he touches you, everything is under control.
He's gone?
No.
Five percent Detroit punch!
This is a move.
He copies Bagoga.
It worked.
Full coverage works.
I can fight.
What?
My body!
He touched me?
Such a small cut completely paralyzed me.
Are you going to do it?
No.
I understand.
It's all blood.
It was weak.
You can't fool me.
You wanted to attack the blind zone and get me out of the game in one hit.
I read it in your movements.
It's not worth it.
But you deserve to live.
You're different from the two of them.
Damn it!
Stop!
Stop!
It's all a mess.
Looks like you're going to get a lot of benefits from me.
Midoriya, try to be more accurate.
I was late because of you.
You're on the road, and you're there too.
Why are you here?
And why are you using your left side?
Why?
It's me.
I immediately realized that something happened.
When you just sent everyone your location.
You're not one of those who would do it without a reason.
So you got into trouble.
Don't worry.
The pros will be here soon too.
It's hot.
There will be more guests soon.
It looks exactly like I imagined.
I won't let you kill them.
Todoroki!
Don't let him hurt you!
He can control the body of the enemy if he drinks his blood.
So he won us!
He drinks the blood of the victim to support the effect of paralysis.
That's why he uses so many blades.
Then I'll keep my distance.
Damn!
You have worthy friends.
Ingenious!
Sword?
He threw it in the same second as the knife.
It was close.
Strong.
Why are you...
Why?
Please stop.
I inherited my brother's name.
I'm the one who should do it.
And this guy is mine.
You inherited?
Sounds strange.
The Ingenium I knew never made such a face.
You had a lot of family problems too.
Todoroki!
Covering the field of vision for a faster enemy?
What an idiotic plan!
How do you know?
And you're pretty good.
From above!
Midoriya!
For some reason I can move!
Is the time of action over?
It can't be!
He hit him with the last one!
I can't move!
I can't move!
I can't move!
I hit him with the last one!
And I'm still paralyzed!
So the first blood group...
To Midoriya!
He needs the blood of the victim to move it.
But from me, the first one had an effect.
There are several reasons for this.
The effect weakens the three paralysis of many people.
It also depends on its duration.
It is also possible that everything depends on the human blood group.
The blood group?
I have the third one.
I have the second one.
So the blood group...
That's right.
The killer is the hero!
He is the spot!
The miracle of blood clots!
Try the human blood.
He can move it up to eight minutes.
The effect weakens starting from the third, fourth, second, and ends with the first.
Even knowing his miracle, we are in an unfavorable position.
We need to hurry and get them out of here.
Yes.
But he's too fast, even for me.
We will be open.
We must avoid an open collision with him.
Todoroki, you've lost a lot of blood.
I'll distract him, and you'll attack from behind.
It's pretty risky.
But we have no other choice.
The two of us must protect them.
So the two of us have to help each other.
Ida, I've been worried about you since your brother was attacked.
Because I know the face of a person who has gone through anger and pain.
And I also know that such people have a hazy mind.
That day, I told her about what happened and poured my soul into it.
She was crying and apologizing, but she forgave me with a smile on her face.
She wanted me to move forward and not look back.
This will make her happy and free from the burden of guilt.
If I hadn't changed, I would never have chosen my father's office for internship.
I didn't forgive him.
And I'm not going to.
I went to him because this old bastard is the second hero on the planet.
And I can learn a lot from him.
Be ready, we're going.
Where? Why?
If everything is as I think, then the hero killer will reappear in HOS.
We will go to HOS to shake the world.
Yes, sir.
Yes, he has a nasty nature.
But it doesn't change the fact that I have to take a lot from him.
Everything was so simple.
But this simplicity was so difficult to consider.
This is your strength and a lot more.
Just a few words.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Just a few words.
It's them.
First, save this guy.
I came to save you, Ida.
The two of us have to protect them.
I'll kill you.
His movements became sharper.
Midoriya!
Please stop.
I'm already...
If you want to stop us, then get up.
The only thing I can tell you...
Be the one you want to see yourself.
Ingenium is the hero who will punish you.
