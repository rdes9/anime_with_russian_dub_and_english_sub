The world began to be inhabited by superhumans.
And about 80% of the people were with these reasons.
In a world full of chaos.
A profession that everyone dreamed of and that everyone respected and became prestigious.
The right heroes fight the villains and save the world.
Yes, this story is about how I became the greatest hero.
YouTube
That's why I was looking for the courage I needed
As the cruel fate is determined
As it will be chosen before me one day
Just for a moment, this moment, if I can breathe
I thought it would be okay, that heart
Once again, it's so dark, it's so dark
But someone inside me sings
So passionately that I don't know what to do
I opened my eyes all the time
So that you will never be sad again
A song to become such a hero
Goodbye, the pin of the shadow
The story that rolls around
And now I am responsible for these three
Their dreams
He kept the bandage on his head the least
Midoriya, it's all thanks to your last attack
In the fourth place of Midoriya's team
The first four teams go to the final part
Episode 19, born with a golden spoon on board
The final will begin after the lunch break
We'll hear more
Damn, I'm hungry
Where to eat?
Hurry up and eat
So, what did you want to talk about?
If we don't hurry
Then he won't be able to breathe in the canteen
It's...
He's different from Kachan
He only presses me with his presence
I couldn't
And I didn't keep my promise
He didn't use it
Even when it was needed as never before
His left side
Neither Ida, nor Kaminaris Yaoi Rose
Neither Takayami Surorakai
Couldn't see it
At that moment I realized
That I was discouraged
After all, only I saw all the power of the Almighty
What do you want to say to that?
I wanted to say that your aura is very similar to him
Midoriya, you...
Are you the illegitimate son of the Almighty?
Inevitable son?
The Almighty is watching over you
I see
So, that's what he's talking about
So what?
No, it's not like that
The illegitimate son would be the same
So you probably won't believe me
But I swear it's not like that
In fact, I want to ask you something
Why did you say that?
You said it's not like that
So there's some connection between you
That you can't talk about
My father is a hard worker
He's always been hero number two
And if you're connected with hero number one
Then I have to beat you
Hey
Long time no see
Let's go have some tea
Almighty
We haven't talked for 10 years, have we?
I thought I'd say hello when I saw you
I see, now you're happy
Leave me
I'm not going to drink tea here
What's this nonsense? Get off
Why are you so cold?
Your son, young Shota, is doing great without your fire
You've taught him well
What do you want to say about that?
I just want to know about
How did you raise such a fighter?
That's what I told you
Your theft of an eternal child
Takes me out of myself
Well, I'm sorry
And now wind it up
I'll make a hero out of him
Who will surpass you
That's why I sent him to UA
What are you talking about?
Although he behaves like a rebel
It's age
But he will surpass you
And I will contribute to that
My father will do everything to improve his situation
He made his name his unwavering will
And that's why the Almighty was always at his side
And since he couldn't surpass him
He came up with a plan
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
Did you hear about marriage for the sake of a miracle?
After the appearance of a miracle
Such marriages entered into fashion
After the second or third generation
The choice of a partner was only in the power of a miracle
Which he will be able to pass on to his descendants
And marriages were in force
And this system was on fire from the very beginning
Such an entrepreneurial person as my father
Easily achieved the position of the parents of my mother
And took under his power her miracle
He is obsessed with the idea of ​​creating a hero
Which will surpass the Almighty
To hell with him
I will never be a weapon in the hands of this freak
As much as I remember
My mother always cried
Your left side is terrible
She said and splashed boiling water into me
I strive to defeat you from my own beliefs
And I'm not going to use the miracle of this moron
No
I keep the victory here
And I'll show that I'm giving up on him
I was just shocked
He is completely different
Although our goals are the same
But we are so different
If you don't want to talk about how you are connected with the Almighty
Then so be it
I will defeat you using only my right side
I'm sorry I took your time
If it were a comic book
He would be a hero
What kind of prehistory would he have?
What can I oppose him?
I
All this time I used the help of others
And now too
I'm standing here
Thanks to all those who helped me
Everything is fine
Why?
Because I'm here
Can I give him a point?
I will support you no matter what
Heroes just don't get it
We went through the first obstacle
On the way, Daku
Let's unite, Tsar of the Mountain
He kept the bandage on his head the least
You can become a hero
To save people
With a smile on their face
The Almighty
I want to be like him
And I have to be strong enough to become number one
Maybe this motive is empty compared to yours
But
I can't lose
Not only for myself
But also for all those who helped me
That's why I accept your challenge
And as an answer
I will win the confrontation
The End
So, the break is over
And it's time for the final matches
But before the edge
There's good news for those who didn't pass
It's a sports festival
We have prepared a competition
In which the former can take part
We even invited real charleaders from America
To cheer you up
What?
What are they doing?
What happened, Aklas?
Is it some kind of gift for the male audience?
Mineta, Kaminari, did you deceive us?
During the break
I'm Oirozu, Jiro
What do you want?
I know that you're old and all that
But the organizers said that you should support the remaining participants
I didn't hear anything about it
You may not believe us
But Aizawa, the teacher, told us about it
I thought you could forget about it
So I remembered
Why am I always caught in their trap?
I used my magic to create costumes
Real idiots
Why not?
We have nothing to do anyway
Great, let's break away
What?
Glent, do you like Toro?
Great, let's enjoy the battles in the final
16 people from 4 teams take part in it
The battles are held in 1v1 format
1v1 battle, huh?
I'm going up on the stage I've been watching every year
Did you have a tournament last year?
There's always a difference, but in the end it all comes down to 1v1 battles
Last year there were also battles on the swords
So, the pairs will be determined by the draw
After the draw we will have an entertaining part and start
Each of the 16 finalists can decide whether to participate or not
I'm sure you won't mind having a rest
So, let's start with the first place
I'm sorry
I refuse to participate
Hojira, why?
The chance to prove yourself is rare
I don't remember what happened at the horse battle
I think it's because of that guy
If I remember correctly, Hojira was in the team with...
I know, the chance is rare
And it's stupid to refuse him
Hojira, but...
Everyone put so much effort into this battle
And I can't stand on the same level with you
I don't know what happened
Don't worry about it
I'll just do my best on the last test
I'm not that different either
It happens
No, it's completely different
It's a matter of honor
I just can't
And by the way, why are you wearing a cheerleader suit?
I'm not Rengeki Shoda from B-Class
I also refuse to participate
Regardless of my abilities
Don't you think that your system is not developed?
People who didn't do anything for the victory shouldn't be in the finals
What's wrong with them?
They've completely lost
What an unexpected turn of events
And what will Mrs. Ponch say?
A sincere confession, right?
I like it!
I accept Shoda and Hojira's refusal!
She didn't think for a long time
And I'm not going to refuse
And that means that the place of two winners will be taken by the Kendo team
Here it is
The place of our team, which miraculously got to the fifth place
We give it to the other
Right?
The team that fought to the end and showed itself
It was the Tetsu-Tetsu team, right?
Kendo?
I'm not doing this because of our friendship
It will be more correct
Guys, you...
So, Tetsu-Tetsu and Shiozaki get to 16 finalists
And here is our net
Here it is!
Again! That's too much!
I'm going all out
I'm counting on you
Merci!
You're not very lucky with your opponent
It's the other way around
If I win this game, we'll fight in the second round
But before that...
Who is Shinzo?
It's you, Midoriya Izuku
This student...
Depending on the results, our classes should change
Class B
I can't wait to start the match
I...
Midoriya!
Ojiro, what happened?
Don't talk to him
We'll meet earlier than I expected
Come on, Midoriya
I'll finish you off with these very hands
What?
Who's that?
You're Ida, right?
Yeah, it's me
Great!
Actually...
It's all great, but we have a festival here
It's time to light up!
Great!
The first test is the move for items
Does anyone have a bag?
A cat, a notebook
Anybody, give me a cat!
Give me a notebook, please!
This is a game of good and evil!
Damn, they took all these children's competitions seriously
These jumps out of the class are too difficult
Monomo!
Are you coming with me?
What is it?
A stubborn person
Genna, I'm not as stubborn as you think
Nothing, it will go down anyway
We were told that we can relax
But we didn't have time for that
Someone was developing a strategy
Someone was trying to come up with ideas
Someone was getting ready for battle
Someone was trying to understand their feelings
The others were just trying to calm down
And while everyone was getting ready for the battle
It was time for her to begin
So, almost everything is ready
Thank you, Cementos!
Hey, people, are you ready?
After so many tests, the moment that everyone has been waiting for has come
It all depends on you
In life, you will often encounter this
You understand it, don't you?
Will, skills, transparency and experience
Put it all together, you'll make it
Hey!
Sorry, I'm late, but...
But you were able to reduce the power of one for all
All-powerful?
No, I'm not sure yet
I keep remembering how I attacked that villain back then
And if I don't concentrate, I'll break all my bones
I'm not sure if I can do it
And if I don't concentrate, I'll break all my bones
You saw it yourself
In my current state
Even if I can control it
My power increases a little bit
Well, judging by the scale from 1 to 100
Now you can control about 5% of your power
Only 5%?
Now I'm sure I've only been here once
You're lucky
You just have to do everything you can
And you don't have to do any shit
You don't want to be a hero who will be remembered by a sad face, do you?
Moments when you're full of fear and anxiety
Should meet with a smile on your face
You've already declared yourself
So don't hit your face in the dirt
Straighten your chest and don't forget
I'm watching you
Mommy
Attention, everyone
The final battle begins
So the first battle
He's all right with the rankings, but something's wrong with his face
Midoriya Izo you from the class of heroes
Against
Sorry, but he's nothing different
Hitoshi Shintsu from the class of general student
The rules are simple
If your opponent is outside of the arena
Either he is immobile, or he will say, I give up, you won!
Fight as you want, the healing lady is already waiting for you in the lazerete.
Your moral principles can be left out of the arena.
Of course, killing is prohibited.
This is unacceptable!
Heroes do not know mercy only when they deal with villains.
I will interrupt the match if something goes wrong.
I give up. Stop the word, right?
This test is intended to test the strength of your spirit.
If you look at the future confidently, there is no place for fear here.
Ready?
This monkey is still carrying some kind of nonsense.
The battle begins!
He threw such a chance into the trash.
What an idiot.
What did you say?
My victory.
Oh, damn, I warned him!
Hey, hey, hey, what happened?
This is the first match, and there are already so many emotions!
Midoriya, wake up, the match has already begun!
He stands like a digger!
The continuation follows.

So, this is the preview!
The final match of Midoriya.
Why did you say that so suddenly?
I wanted to tell you about the abilities of the B-class Shinsa.
I wanted to tell you about the abilities of the B-class Shinsa.
I wanted to tell you about your first opponent.
Hojira, you are so mad at me, why?
I just wanted to get into the preview.
I just wanted to get into the preview.
You are so honest!
Next, victory or death!
The voices of those who came will be heard in the stadium to support us.
The voices of those who came will be heard in the stadium to support us.
Endless limit plus Ultra!
