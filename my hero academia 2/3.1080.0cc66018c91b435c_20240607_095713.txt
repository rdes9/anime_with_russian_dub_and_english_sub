The world began to be inhabited by superhumans, and about 80% of people were with these miracles.
In a world full of chaos, a profession that everyone dreamed of and that everyone respected, it became prestigious.
Righteous heroes fight villains and save people.
Yes, this story is about how I became the greatest hero.
My Heroic Academy, Season 2
The Heroic Academy
Midoriya, I will defeat you.
Students from other classes rush to victory, no matter what.
I will not back down for anything.
I will also put everything on the line.
The Heroic Academy
Episode 16. The Way of Their Own Miracles
And this is the U.A. Sports Festival, the scene for the first years.
First round, running with obstacles.
There are no rules in this race, except one.
You can't go beyond the track, like in rat races.
We switch to our cameras, installed on the robots around the track.
So, will these birds be able to break through the robots from the fields?
If they can, it will be a great task for the future.
Now my old man is watching me.
He stopped them!
There is a passage between the legs!
I would not stand there. I froze them in an unstable position.
They will fall.
The road from Class 1A! He was the first to pass the obstacle!
Oh, my God, someone is under the rubble!
Will it not kill him?
It's dangerous for the future!
I will not back down!
I will not back down!
I will not back down!
I will not back down!
I will not back down!
I will not back down!
I will not back down!
I will not back down!
Will it not kill him?
It's dangerous for the future!
I will not back down!
Kirishima got out of Class 1A!
It's unbelievable!
I swear to God!
You destroyed this machine in time!
Someone could have died!
Kirishima Eijiro!
With a miracle of a spell!
His body becomes super-hard!
With the most powerful spear!
Or the most powerful shield!
Damn it!
It consists of complete idiots!
Tessu-Tessu from Class B was barely crushed!
It's madness!
Anyone would have died in my place!
Tessu-Tessu, miracle of steel!
His body can be covered with steel!
And this is his main defense of the main weapon!
And similar miracles!
I've had enough!
Kirishima Eijiro!
Wait, little one!
They are crazy!
Could you not worry about them being crushed?
Maybe we should unite forces to break through?
Bakugo!
Do you think I'll let you go far?
Bakugo from Class 1A!
He decided to jump over them!
But...
I knew it!
You can't back down with your character!
You can't back down with your character!
But you should maneuver!
It's time to ride the windmill!
Seru-Hanta, miracle of tape!
The tape comes out of his elbows!
He can wrap it back!
Or cut it off to wrap the enemies in it!
Let's land!
That's right!
Takayami Fumigaki!
Miracle, dark shadow!
A shadow monster lives inside him!
And he can materialize it!
As expected!
Many of those who have overcome the obstacle
are studying in Class A.
It's not because
other classes' students are weak.
It's just that
Class A students don't sit still.
They touched the terrifying world.
What awaits them during the attack on UAE?
Launch!
Now they know what fear is.
They made it
and chose to stay alive.
And the experience that they got
from the attack on UAE
is the same as the experience
they had from Class A.
It's the same experience
they had from Class A.
It's the same experience
they had from Class A.
And the experience they had from Class A
is the same as the experience
they had from Class A.
At the early stages,
I can't rely on one for all.
It's a metal plate
of that robot!
These robots capture
the target and chase it.
They gain speed.
And then...
They can't stop!
I can move!
I can move!
A good shield
will come out of this thing!
How convenient!
A rose?
How about two fingers?
Be open!
It was so easy
to deal with these robots.
It's not surprising
that they were recommended.
During the entrance exam,
they should have been avoided.
And now we tell them
to get rid of them.
But what are these pieces of metal?
They have holes all over the body.
I want you to declare
the world about yourself!
It will be
pure madness.
I don't care about anything.
Everything or nothing.
Hey!
The first test was empty!
What do you say about the second?
You will fall and you will lose!
If you don't want to fall, then crawl!
After all, this is a canyon!
When did they manage to build all this?
Tsuya? Kwa?
Kwa?
And this is a praised rope?
And it's fast!
Gloss!
This is my chance to get famous!
Now my tools will be in the center of attention!
Watch out for Japanese companies!
A hook-cat!
And levitating boots!
Support course?
What? And you could take a suit in the race?
In the course of heroes,
training battles are held, right?
So that everything is fair,
we were allowed to take the equipment
that we developed ourselves.
At least we were told so.
For the support faculty!
This is a chance to show our potential
with a bump from local corporations.
So watch
and I hope I will be noticed
by a large company!
These are my super cute
tools!
Amazing!
Annoying!
We need a victory!
What kind of double standards?
Cool!
A lot of people try
hard to get the way to the final!
Yes, Sotrigolov?
And what are these idiots waiting for?
What did you expect from the leader?
He easily overcomes the canyon!
It looks like he's on fire.
It's hard to get up, huh?
Damn it!
Brother is looking at me, that's for sure!
I can't stay in the fools!
This is not cool!
The guy in the first place is stronger than the others.
And his charm is abnormally strong.
And he is also adorned with an athletic body
and a sharp mind.
That's right!
By the way, he is the son of a fire hero,
a hard worker!
Come on!
Does he have the blood of the strongest hero
after the almighty?
They will all fight,
as long as he becomes their partner!
The leaders are already far ahead,
but there are still a bunch of dark horses behind!
We have not yet announced how many people will pass,
so press the button!
We are smoothly moving on to the last test!
To be honest,
this is a minefield!
Look!
You have a mine right in front of your eyes!
So look at both of them
and move your legs!
Well, these mines are not very dangerous,
they will not kill,
but it is not a sin to get wet from these little ones!
It all depends on you!
The leaders are already there?
Faster!
Faster!
I see.
And this obstacle creates the biggest problems for the leaders.
Play in public!
I'm sick of this!
You fool!
You crossed the wrong person's path!
The fight for the leadership has begun!
Admit it,
this is the turn you have been waiting for so long!
And the other participants do not lag behind!
However,
the leaders are slowing each other down!
Will they be able to withstand the test in time?
They are too far!
But still, I have not lost yet!
Thank you for the idea!
Katchan!
A powerful explosion at the entrance to the field!
Is something wrong?
What?
Is he doing it on purpose?
Or...
Midori is rushing forward
because of the class!
Using the explosive wave!
These mines...
These are ordinary pressure mines.
They are not so powerful.
But if you step on them,
you will immediately lose your pace.
I will spend a lot of time!
I do not want to get hit.
I'd better slow down and pass them without touching them.
And it is also not an option to jump carelessly.
The further you go, the more
mines you have under your feet.
No one can avoid them!
Look carefully!
Look at the places
that are avoided!
People, as always,
will be careful at the entrance to the field.
There are still a few mines left.
Everything will be fine.
I wonder what he is doing.
Bakugo and Todoroki are still in the lead!
They will soon cross the finish line!
Great!
Thank you for the idea, Katchan!
Explosive turbo acceleration!
This is...
Midori from the class
flies forward at full speed!
He is already in the lead!
Everything is going according to plan!
But I was shocked with such power!
And...
How can I land?
I will not give up!
I will not give up!
I will not give up!
Deku!
Don't you dare overtake me!
You will give an advantage to those
who are behind you.
But I will take care of them later.
The two who were in the lead
stopped interfering with each other
and are pursuing Midori!
They now have a common opponent
and there is no time to waste!
The race is not over yet!
What are you talking about?
Damn!
I'm losing speed at this pace!
They will overtake me!
I will lose a lot of time
and I will not be able to fight for the lead!
Damn!
I can't retreat!
I have only one chance
when these two are in the right position!
Don't let go!
If I can't get the lead back,
then I can't let you go either!
Midori immediately blocked the path
of the pursuers!
Do you see this?
He also cleared the road from the mines!
Look at your head!
Your class is just something!
Why are you torturing them there?
Nothing like that.
They themselves stimulate
the development of each other.
This is the UA Sports Festival!
The arena of the first years!
Are you ignoring me?
I can't imagine that things
will take such a turn!
And the first one who returned to the stadium
is none other than...
Izuku Midoriya!
Izuku!
Hey, it's that guy!
Definitely!
He was there a year ago!
That guy...
Sports Festival is a place
where they have to fight
for the place under the sun,
where they have to step over others.
Modern heroes live
at the expense of their popularity,
and their main desire
is self-improvement.
You are a hero
in the depths of your soul,
that you live for the sake of saving others.
That's why you are here.
That's why you are here.
That's why you are here.
I was here,
to save others.
That's why I chose you.
However...
It was your weakness.
My doubts were baseless!
Sorry!
You should stop being such awork out!
What do you think?
For starters,
Midoriya's popularity will rise,
however he still hasn't shown
If you think about it, how are you going to sell it? What do you think?
Let's discuss it.
He doesn't have a good appearance.
If he was talented or particularly attractive, we could somehow outplay it.
But the absence of a base is alarming.
Ha, management course.
The same as always.
Management course!
They have no benefit from participating in the festival.
Now they sharpen their skills by trading.
They have a lot of time.
Again.
Damn.
Damn you.
Here are the others.
One after the other, they cross the finish line.
Results, we will announce later.
But for now, take a rest. You deserve it.
Neko, you are great.
Hurray.
Congratulations.
You're great.
I'm so jealous.
No, I'm just...
I was just lucky.
I did what I thought was effective.
It's pure luck.
And it was Vera's blow.
The real test is yet to come.
I didn't sign up for this.
I ate the fish and made it to the finish line.
I'm just a genius.
I hate you.
The first round is over.
Here are your results.
WeExciting
The first 42 places get a chance to go further.
I'm sorry, but don't be upset.
You'll also have a chance to show your true self.
The qualifiers continue.
The press is not happy with themselves.
Get out on all 100.
Well, second round.
I already know what will happen.
Well, I did not miss the pre-battle mandrake.
And this...
The battle is over?
I do not like this.
Is this a team competition and what are the rules?
I will explain now.
You collect a team of two to four participants.
This is compared to a normal battle of human wheelchairs.
With one difference.
The distribution of points is based on the results of the previous test.
As well as on the entrance exam.
It was easy to predict.
The number of points for the combat unit of the wheelchairs depends on the number of people who are outside.
Ah, I got it.
Actually, I'm explaining here.
Shut up!
Yes, you are right.
The number of points is calculated from the end.
The 42nd place gets 5 points.
The 41st place gets 10 points.
Well, for the first place...
10 million!
What?
10 million?
Ten, huh?
In general, in your place, I would hunt for him.
And you will get to the top despite the place in the race.
That's right.
Welcome to the game for survival.
We have given everyone a chance to win.
The continuation follows.
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
She's having the momentum!
Let's talk about the next episode, Deku.
Round 2. The battle is over.
Four people are formed in this game, but...
No one wants to play this game!
Deku, are you alone?
Deku, you're lonely, aren't you?
She said it twice!
Next! Strategy, strategy, strategy!
Don't let your tears run out like a stream!
Go away already!
Plus Ultra!
