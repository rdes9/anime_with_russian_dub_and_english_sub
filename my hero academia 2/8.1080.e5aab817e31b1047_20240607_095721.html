Sorry for the wait!
Because of the stormy participant, the arena was covered with ice.
But now we are ready to start!
The killer from B-class!
Believe me, she can do a lot!
Shouzaki from B-class!
The killer from B-class!
Believe me, she can do a lot!
Shouzaki from B-class
against這個call for action!
Den-Ki Kamenari from the character class!
Episode 21 Battle of the Protan Wars
What a thrilling battle!
So...
Sorry for theから
What were you going to do?
I wanna win without killing
I didn't come here to do something like that.
I didn't come here to control the Shiai Aito.
I-I-I'm sorry!
I wanted to go to the U.A. academy not for any selfish reasons.
I just wanted to save innocent people from trouble.
Yes, yes, I'm sorry!
My mistake, I'm sorry!
Thank you for your understanding.
Are there people in B-class who are not separated by tact?
She's pretty cute, but at the same time...
She's clearly not weak.
Should I fight her with all my might or not?
She's just a concentration of grace and cuteness.
There's no such thing as cuteness.
I have to get to her somehow.
Okay.
In any case, let's get started!
Do you want to go to the cafe after the match?
I'll treat you if you beat me.
I'm not going to...
I'm not going to!
All-encompassing discharge!
1,300,000 volts!
The match is over!
There's no show!
Shazaki makes it to the quarterfinals!
I did everything I could.
I'm going to beat you!
I'm going to beat you!
I'm going to beat you!
I'm going to beat you!
I'm going to beat you!
Shouzaki Ibarra, the wonder of the Terni.
The Terni on her head is well stretched.
For growth, you need water and sunlight.
The speed of their growth is amazing.
In general, she is not in danger of baldness.
Great!
Good job, Shouzaki!
Oh, damn.
Didn't expect it?
It's not for you to grow raspberries in the garden.
He's so fast.
He needed a little more than a second to be defeated.
He's so fast.
He's so fast.
It was a little more than a second.
You should be stronger than us.
What went wrong?
Sorry, guys.
And what was it?
Kamae-san, Kamae-san!
She was created to become a great hero of support.
Yes, I would not be a tree, but ...
She is straight.
And it only paints.
Hey, enough of that.
Shiozaki couldn't do anything with her putas, could he?
Her lozze absorbed all of Shiozaki's electricity.
Yeah, he didn't even have a chance.
Plus, she can control them at a distance.
Yeah, she's a complete Shiozaki's antipode.
It happens that the spell is ineffective, but even so, you have to keep fighting.
The Kaminaria spell is in the strong category, and Shiozaki was fourth in the entrance exam.
The lozze is very similar to the tree that the Kamui controls.
Such spells are very strong.
And the main question is how to resist them?
It's almost impossible to reduce the distance without getting hit by her lozze.
You have to cut them off or be damn strong.
To avoid this, she's always behind your back.
So, the match is just over, and you're already thinking of a strategy against her?
No, it's kind of my hobby.
And now I have the opportunity to learn about the other miracles.
Yeah, I already know everything about our classmates.
And about your zero-gravity field.
Deku, you've always been so cool, but at this festival you surprise me again and again.
So, it's time for the fourth match.
The festival of youth continues.
Through the
I forgot about it!
Aoyama was wearing a belt, so I thought it was allowed.
So he submitted an application.
I apologize.
I was touched by her sportsmanship.
Even though I was in the support class, she said that we were equal once we got here.
She wanted to equalize our chances, and she gave me all this.
I couldn't ignore her spirit.
Oh, youth!
Use it for your health.
You'd live according to the use of equipment, wouldn't you?
If so, why not?
Stop, Hatsume is not one of those who will say that.
Really?
All right, all right, let's get started already.
These accelerators are just a miracle, aren't they?
Microphone?
But why?
I even grabbed the speakers.
Don't you think your legs are getting lighter?
That's what happened to me.
But I...
I can get back at anything, because I've got a remote control.
And now the business sharks have arrived.
They're looking at me.
I can see them.
Hatsume Mei.
Binocular miracle.
She can see at a distance five meters.
She can see at a distance five meters.
She can see at a distance five meters.
She can see at a distance five kilometers.
I've got a remote control even on my back.
Nothing will go away from my sight.
What were you thinking?
Iida was able to turn at such a high speed.
It's all thanks to my wonderful car mechanic.
What kind of a bazaar is this?
I should have gone on sale.
You don't have to worry about trifles.
The car mechanic is equipped with a 32-axis gyroscope.
You can't fall, I guarantee you.
Only if you want to.
What about an honest battle?
Oh, pay attention to how I steam.
There are generators and electromagnetic induction in the boot.
Even gravity is weak here.
Just land and I'll give you a ride.
What the hell?
It's a grid-mode.
Both of them fit up to five grids.
Who invented all this?
It's me, Hatsume Mei.
And for everyone it should be obvious that I have no equal.
Hatsume Mei, Hatsume Mei, Hatsume Mei.
She will give the forum to politicians.
So, we have something.
Does she have anything else?
Ten minutes later.
Phew, I imagined everything I could.
My PR campaign is over.
The end.
Hatsume went beyond the arena.
Ida goes on.
You lied to me.
Sorry, but that's the way it is.
I hate you.
Ida is very naive.
She told them whatever she wanted and said everything.
Hatsume can be not only honest, but also punchy.
If it comes to work.
Cool.
And we move on to the fifth fight.
He carries the belt, but all his strength is still in the ass.
Yuga Oyama from the class of heroes.
Banjo, guys.
Against.
What to expect from these terrifying horns.
Mina Ashida from the class of heroes.
And how is the portfolio with the opponent?
I'll tickle you with my laser.
Mina, go ahead.
Aoyama, set it on fire.
Win her.
Yes, so that the clothes are torn off.
Cheap dwarf.
In the match of Aoyama against Ashida,
given their miracles,
Aoyama will keep a distance and shoot from the laser.
Most likely, the result of the match will depend on how Ashida will turn away from Aoyama's attack and will hit in return.
I'm not lucky.
There is no cover in the arena.
So she is in an unfavorable position.
And we continue.
Fight.
Bird eats worm.
This is the law.
We were in the same team.
So I know everything about your magic.
It concerns me too.
What distinguishes us is that we are on the test of endurance.
If I hold the laser for more than a second, my stomach starts to hurt.
You told me about your weaknesses.
You are stubborn.
My stomach.
Like this.
Oh no, my precious belt.
And pants.
I will cut you with my crown uppercut.
Aoyama is defeated.
Ashida goes on.
Aoyama is knocked out.
The victory of Ashida is indisputable.
Nina, you are great.
If Aoyama and Ashida had changed their abilities...
How would I give you a ball?
As I expected, Ashida won.
But her physical capabilities were higher than expected.
She was 9th during the test of our magic.
And there were guys there.
She has great physical data.
And this is not due to her magic.
You can't lose minutes.
Next is the match number 6.
Hey, stop beating Bakusha.
He attacks and defends.
Night war accompanied by a dark shadow.
Takayama Fumigaki from the class of heroes.
Against...
All-creating hero.
She has a recommendation letter.
Her talents are highly appreciated.
Yaoi Rose from the class of heroes.
Midoriya, what do you think about this confrontation?
Time will show.
Time?
Everything is as the commentator said.
My opponent is Takayama.
He can attack while defending.
In addition to everything, his shadow is very fast.
Most likely he will make a warning blow.
You can't do anything with an ordinary shield here.
You need time to create something effective.
Go to hell!
Dark shadow attacks.
Got it!
I need a shield.
And now a weapon.
I can't concentrate.
No!
He stopped attacking.
Now!
Yaoi Rose!
Outside the arena!
Takayama goes further.
An incredible victory!
His opponent is completely defeated.
Dark shadow Takayama!
What can be better?
How so?
I was completely helpless.
Absolutely.
Takayama is very cool.
I can't believe he was able to push her out.
His attacks came to her shield.
Didn't he want to hurt her?
It was too easy for him.
She's really broken now.
Doki-doki! Moving on!
In the next match, two strong fighters will clash.
Hard and sparkling steel!
Tetsu-Tetsu from the B-class!
Yes, like this!
Against!
An incredibly strong incineration!
Kirishima Eijiro from the B-class!
Why? We were introduced the same way!
Go, Tetsu-Tetsu!
Win like Ibarra did!
Who allowed you to sleep?
So, fight!
Fight! Start!
Room number two.
Well done, Iida.
Oh, Uraraka.
What's wrong with you? Your eyebrows came out of control!
Eyebrows?
Ah, it's all because of nerves.
Now eyebrows don't listen.
Oh, I see.
Your opponent is Bakugo, right?
Yes, and I'm really scared.
But you know, seeing what's happening, especially you, Iida...
Me?
Uraraka!
Deku!
Why are you here?
Don't you want to watch the fights?
Most of them are over.
And now Kirishima is fighting against a student from the B-class.
Iida!
I don't feel pain at all!
Same as I do!
Then...
Soon...
You know, I don't think Bakugo will fight against a girl with all his might.
No, it's his style.
Everyone wants to take the first place to make their dreams come true.
It's not about rock climbing.
No one will hold back.
Uraraka, you've helped me a lot.
That's why I have to help you.
I've developed a strategy against rock climbing.
The sketch is approximate, but it should work.
Oh, isn't that great, Uraraka?
You did it!
Thank you, Deku.
But...
I can do it myself.
Deku, you're amazing.
You're really versatile.
During the battle of the Horseman, I thought I had to unite with my friends.
But now I realize that it was you who made this decision.
That's why when Iida said she was making her own decision,
I was ashamed of myself.
Uraraka...
That's why I don't need your help.
Everyone is determined to win and do everything they can.
And that means we're all rivals, right?
So...
Our meeting is supposed to take place in the final!
No!
Tetsu Tetsu and Kirishima's confrontation!
It was a tough fight, but he won!
No one!
It's a draw!
After they come to their senses,
we'll choose the winner with a simple challenge.
They have the same abilities, don't they?
I like enthusiasts like them.
They're one of those who can inspire.
While we're waiting for Kirishima and Tetsu Tetsu to make their corrections,
we'll have the next match.
I'm a bit worried about the next match's contestant.
Damn, I don't want to watch this.
Uraraka...
Do your best.
The last match of the first round!
The middle school star!
But he didn't make it!
Kazuki Bakugo from the class of heroes!
Against...
I'm going to cheer for her.
Ochaku Uraraka from the class of heroes!
The battle begins!
Stand up!
Timing and working with the sound of the Praxinus.
Text read by Jam.
Let's hear it again.
The final match of the first round!
The final match of the first round!
The final match of the first round!
The final match of the first round!
The final match of the first round!
The final match of the first round!
The final match of the first round!
The final match of the first round!
The final match of the first round!
The final match of the first round!
The final match of the first round!
The final match of the first round!
The final match of the first round!
I will show you all I've got!
I'll grab your hand!
You'll be okay!
I'm not alone anymore!
I will never give up!
I will cry,
treat you good.
Oh something exactly!
Didn't you forget about the preview?
Uraraka, I feel confident in your words!
After the first fight with Kachan, she will pass!
But I will do it!
In order to become a hero and help my family!
Deku, let's meet in the final!
Yes, good luck, Uraraka!
Next, Bakugo vs. Uraraka!
Meteorites that rain will fall from the sky!
I will show you the way to victory!
Infinity is not the limit!
Plus Ultra!
