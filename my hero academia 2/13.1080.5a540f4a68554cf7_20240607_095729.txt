After the festival, we were given a few days to heal our wounds, and today our classes will start again.
That's what I thought, but...
Dude! Hey, dude! Midori from the class of heroes!
You did well at the festival.
And almost won. Did you get into the top 8? Cool!
He's smaller than I thought.
He reminds me of my youth.
And he tries his best.
Don't give up, hero!
Thank you?
Thank you!
Thank you!
The end
It's so early in the morning, I'm already tired.
Good morning, Midori!
Iida!
Why are you wearing a coat and boots?
Why are you walking so slowly?
You'll be late!
Late? I have five minutes before the bell rings!
The students are supposed to be at the class in 10 minutes!
Iida, it's...
If you're a brother, he's fine now.
I'm sorry I bothered you.
Episode 26. The choice of hero names.
Everything looked completely different on TV.
On the way to school, I met a bunch of people.
Like me.
I was very embarrassed when they looked at me.
Hagakura, I thought you were used to it.
Some of the best classmates started to console me.
Don't worry.
In one day we became so famous.
QA is just something.
Good morning.
Good morning!
Kiru!
Teacher Aizawa, did you take off your bandages?
I'm so glad!
The healing lady was taking care of my treatment seriously.
More importantly, this is our special class hour today.
Finally!
Special?
Some kind of victory?
I hope not.
I'm bad at the hero code and the rules in general.
Hero names.
You will choose your pseudonyms.
This is cool!
This is directly related to the training.
Usually, the practice takes place in the second or third year.
When the students are experienced enough to become assistants.
In other words, what they invite to the first year
shows their interest in your future.
After graduation, you can only dream of such luxury.
Adults are so self-satisfied.
That is, we must show ourselves from the best side.
That's right.
Now I will show the list of those invited to the internship.
The number of invitations.
Todoroki, Bakugo, Toyama, Ida, Kaminarie, Yaoyorozu, Kirishima, Uraraka, Seru.
In previous episodes, the number of invitations to the first year
was more even.
And now it's spinning around these two.
Such a big trip!
They just can't see my potential.
Todoroki is the first, Bakugo is the second.
At the festival, everything was the other way around.
Some people are scared to invite a dude
who was taken to the stage in chains.
What are they scared of?
You're cool, Todoroki.
Most likely, my father tried.
Wow!
We were invited!
Yes, yes!
Midoriya, you didn't get a single one.
They were scared of your fighting style.
I see.
Whether you want it or not,
you are interested.
And you will have an internship with the heroes.
An internship?
Yes.
In USG, you have already gained
a real combat experience with villains.
But you still need to practice a lot
and watch how professionals work.
That's why you need hero names.
I didn't expect it to be so fun.
Hero names can always be changed.
But take this seriously.
Because then it will be Morocco.
Many hero names of students
become famous and eventually
become fixed for professionals.
Midnight!
Yes, something like that.
It's a complete miracle
that you don't choose something stupid.
This job is not for me.
The choice of Aizawa Shota.
Aiz, haven't you decided
on a hero name yet?
I don't want to be in the news,
so I don't care.
Okay, then...
You will be the head.
As you wish.
When you choose a name,
you must clearly imagine the image
that will be created in the future.
In short, call yourself presentable.
For example, All-Powerful.
All-Powerful.
My hero name.
The name I want to see myself in the future.
Okay, show me your names.
We have to show them.
I'm a little worried.
Okay.
The name of the twinkling hero.
I can't stop blinking.
What does it mean that I can't not shine?
A whole sentence.
You need to shorten it.
Take me away and correct it at first.
You're right, mademoiselle.
It's still too long.
Decide if you're French or English.
Okay, I'm next.
My hero name.
The Queen of Strangers.
Sit down, two.
Do you want to associate with a nasty creature?
Better not.
Damn.
It's stupid.
The first names were very stupid.
Are we competing in stupidity?
Then can I be next?
Yes, come on, Tsu.
I thought about it when I was younger.
The hero of rainy days.
Froppy.
So cute.
Very friendly.
I like it.
This is a great example of a name that everyone will like.
Froppy!
Froppy!
Froppy!
Froppy!
Thank you, Froppy.
You returned a friendly atmosphere.
I want it too.
The hero of the Red Buntary.
Red Buntary?
You give respect to Alma Buntary.
Yes, it's a little old-fashioned,
but I strive for a reputation that Alma Buntary has.
If you take this name,
expectations for you will be higher.
I'm ready for everything.
Kirishima is cool.
See you with the Almighty.
What? Your hero name?
Yes, I can not choose.
Let's see.
Great Humanity,
Mighty Boy,
All-Powerful Young.
Young!
All-Powerful Boy,
Captain All-Powerful,
Super-Mega-Hero.
Super!
Super!
I came up with thousands of similar names.
But now, being under his care and given by his power,
I see the difference between us.
That's why I can not take such a name.
Guys, I haven't come up with anything yet.
Maybe I can help you.
What about Ervest Atupi?
It's like Kimingui who wrote Goodbye Weapon.
Sounds smart.
Cool.
No, even knowing that you are strong.
Yes.
You are still stupid.
Jira, stop making fun of me.
Hero, what do you hear?
Headphone.
Well done.
Next.
Hero of Tentacle.
Tentacle.
Sounds smart,
but you should think about the variations of the sound.
Wrapping Hero,
Cellophane.
Cute and simple.
Well done.
Hero of martial arts,
Tailman.
Name associated with the peculiarities of the body.
Sweet Hero,
Sugar Man.
So sweet.
Pinky.
Cute, pink,
and throw.
Electrozoom,
Electricity,
Power,
Electricity plus Inazuma.
Do not slow down.
Invisible Hero,
Invisible Girl.
Just great.
Continue in the same spirit.
I hope that I will not be ashamed of this name.
Re-creating Heroine.
Creative, creative.
What?
Your name?
Are you sure?
Yes.
Hero of absolute darkness,
Tsukuyomi.
God of the night.
Freshly torn Hero,
Watermelon juice.
Popsova and drinkable.
Friendly Hero,
Anima.
Cute.
King of Explosive Killer.
It will not go.
What the hell?
Maybe the Explosive?
Shut the fuck up.
Okay, my turn.
I thought only up to ...
Ura Viti.
Sounds stylish.
Everything is doing better than I expected.
All that remains is Bakugo,
Ida
and Midoriya, right?
Tenya.
I'm not sure if I should tell you about it.
But I don't feel my legs at all.
What?
It can't be.
The story of Ingenium
ends here.
No.
There are still so many people who are hoping for you.
You can't do that.
I know, I think so too.
That's why
now they are under your control.
Now they are under your care.
Will you take this name?
I'm still ...
You took your name too.
Midoriya, are you ready?
Yes.
There is no other way out.
Midoriya?
Are you sure about that?
It can hold on to you.
Yes,
I didn't like it either.
But one person changed my opinion
and made an indelible impression on me.
It made me happy.
I am no longer Deku,
from the word useless.
Now I am Deku, who is capable of everything.
This is my hero name.
Deku.
Oh, there are still offers for the first years.
Oh, another one.
For whom?
For Midoriya.
Really?
From whom?
From him!
KILLER EXPLOSION!
It's still bad.
Everyone has decided on the hero names.
And it's time to talk about the internship.
It will last a week.
Those who received a lot of invitations,
I will give out the full list of agencies.
So the choice is yours.
For those who did not receive the invitation,
we will have to choose from 40 national agencies
that we work with.
They all have different spheres of activity.
For example, 13th is engaged in saving civilians
and localization of disasters.
They fight villains.
Choose wisely.
Yes!
I want to fight crime.
I work with water cataclysms.
I hope I can.
I'm waiting for your answer after the weekend.
We only have two days?
Yes, don't be stupid.
Everyone is free.
Heroic agency of the hard worker.
Hey, have you already decided where you will go to intern?
I'll go to the great Kansha.
Nineta, have you got dirty ants again in the grapes stuck?
Of course not!
You took a pretty high place.
It's strange that you were not invited.
Well, don't listen!
Deku, have you already decided?
There are only 40 agencies.
They look for heroes and break them into groups.
This is a new kind of art!
Sorry, I just thought about it.
You choose so carefully.
Well, I've already decided where I'm going.
Really?
And where?
To the gunhead's office.
This is a combat agency.
And you're going there?
Yes, I got an invitation from them.
Really?
And I always thought you didn't want to fight.
Yes, of course.
After the battle with Bakugou, I realized...
...that the stronger I become, the wider my abilities will become.
I will not achieve the goal I set if I show my weaknesses.
I see.
Yes.
But I'm more interested.
Why are you shaking?
Oh, you mean...
This is an air chair.
An air chair?
Don't tell me you've been standing like this all the time!
It can't be!
It looks more like torture!
What are you talking about?
Due to an isometric reduction of muscles, you can train without moving!
Shut up!
I can't stop at what I've achieved.
And you have to learn how to control your magic.
You can't catch anyone if you chase two rabbits.
Ndeko, let's go home together.
Yeah.
Ida, come with us.
What?
He's already decided where to go for his internship.
And he went to the teacher's.
I'm here in an extravagant position!
Something happened?
Why are you in such a hurry?
Let's go to a couple of words.
Okay.
You've received an offer for an internship.
What?
Really?
Yes.
The name of the person who invited you is Grant Arena.
He was a teacher of Yoi for about a year.
He was my class leader.
He knows about One for All.
That's why he decided to hire you.
Someone so incredible?
Wait.
Someone else knows about One for All?
Grant Arena was my good friend and teacher.
He hasn't been a hero for a long time.
So I forgot about him.
Maybe it's because I wrote to him about you?
Or because I'm a bad teacher?
If he came so far and invited you under the name of a hero,
it's very, very scary.
Don't shake your legs!
The Almighty is shaking from fear.
I have to train you.
But this is a great opportunity.
Go and enjoy the training.
How scared is he?
Go!
An internship, right?
Yes, a few have already been decided.
This is an important event.
You need to choose carefully.
Some third-graders still wish to have their choice.
That's right.
Ida wants to go to the agency.
I'm sure he was called the best of the best.
The agency of the hero Hoso.
It can't be.
Wow, you got an invitation?
That's cool.
Well, yes.
Ida.
Did Ida leave without us?
Yes.
After the sports festival,
news reported that his brother was attacked.
Heroine Genium was injured in the Hoso area of Tokyo.
The unknown has already killed 17 heroes.
And wounded another 23.
This hero's killer's name is Stein.
If you take this, he's fine now.
I'm sorry I bothered you.
Ida didn't tell me anything.
Later I was surprised when I found out
that he was going to join the Hoso
where his brother was injured.
But we couldn't talk to him.
This continued until the beginning of the internship.
Everyone took their costumes.
Remember, it is forbidden to wear them on the street.
It is forbidden to wear them on the street.
It is forbidden to lose them too.
Got it.
Don't hold back your words, Ashina.
Got it.
Don't forget to behave well
with all the heroes on the internship.
That's it, enough of you. Good luck.
Thank you.
I can't wait.
Ida!
If you feel lonely, you can talk to us.
We are friends.
Yes.
At that moment, I should have been more persistent.
Because I still regret
what happened that day.
The continuation follows.
To be continued...
To be continued...
To be continued...
The hero who is even afraid of the Almighty?
Gran Tareena.
I've never heard of him,
but I'm sure he's very strong.
He just has to be strong.
I came at the address.
My name is Midoriya Izuku.
I'm from the U.A.
Nice to meet you.
He's dead!
Actually, I'm alive.
He's alive!
Here's the preview.
At the internship, I will train with a person
who was the mentor of the Almighty,
Gran Tareena.
But here's the thing.
Who are you, son?
Midoriya Izuku from the U.A.
I'll be training with you for a week.
Who are you?
I just introduced myself.
Toshinori?
No, that's not my name.
What do they call you?
We don't have a dialogue.
We need to do something.
Next, the appearance of the great Gran Tareena.
Infinity and limit!
Plus Ultra!
