When I saw this guy, I thought, I can't beat him!
Damn! Damn! Damn!
Deku, you go there too!
I just... I just started!
Do you hear me? I swear I'll be number one!
Midoriya, I'll beat you.
I promise I'll be number one!
You bastard, don't get into trouble!
It's not over!
What?
We'll take the first place, no matter what!
Die!
Light and noisy grenade!
Bakugo wins!
The final battle will be between Todoroki and Bakugo!
The final battle will be between Todoroki and Bakugo!

The final battle will be between Todoroki and Bakugo!
The final battle will be between Todoroki and Bakugo!
The final battle will be between Todoroki and Bakugo!
The final battle will be between Todoroki and Bakugo!
The final battle will be between Todoroki and Bakugo!
Room number two.
Something's on the left side.
She's scaring me.
Come on, get me out of here!
This is your power!
Where's the beginning?
I didn't even think about it before the battle with Midori.
Mom, I'm...
What?
What the hell did you forget?
This is the room...
What?
This is the second room?
What's going on?
It looks like I'm in the wrong room.
What kind of attitude is that to the enemy?
Hello, I'm talking to you.
Where are you?
Two icebergs!
Funny.
What?
Midori has already criticized me for this.
This guy only does what helps others understand themselves.
Are you childhood friends?
What was he like when you were kids?
In your eyes!
There's a request for help!
Are you okay?
Can you stand?
This damn bastard!
Who the hell cares about him?
I don't care about his life.
Like your family.
This is all bullshit.
Just use your left hand in the fight and don't move.
I can handle it.
I'll give him a tooth.
I'll put him in the dirt.
And I'll conquer another peak.
What?
This is the final fight of the U.A. Sports Festival.
Now the champions of the first years will be determined.
Let's start the preparatory part.
Shodaroki Shota from the class of heroes.
Against...
Katsuki Bakugai from the class of heroes.
And we start!
You're screwed!
Tadaroki immediately moves on to the offensive.
He doesn't want to get into the close fight.
Has the winner already decided?
No, it doesn't look like his Machsero.
He did it to avoid Bakugai's possible maneuvers.
What's that sound?
Is that Bakugai?
What?
He broke free just blowing everything up?
That's not normal.
The stronger the miracle,
the less accurate it is.
You're attacking.
He ignores his right side.
Wow!
Are you underestimating me?
Idiot!
He uses ice to avoid flying beyond the arena.
It looks funny.
Use it.
Use it, Shota!
Enough fooling around.
I'm not strong enough for you.
The way he grabbed Tadaroki by the hand
and the way he guessed the moment for the explosion,
he's a very observant.
In the battle, his strong sides are revealed.
Oh, I get it.
Tadaroki is also good,
but his attacks are too straight.
After the fight with Midori, he's not his own.
Bastard!
I'll show you what I've got!
Bastard!
I'll show you what happens to those
who underestimate me.
You're a dead man.
My championship must be indisputable.
And I won't accept it,
knowing that there is garbage
that doesn't put me in anything.
It makes no sense if I don't surpass Deku.
If you don't want to win,
then why the hell did you get on my way?
What did you forget?
Me too.
I want to be a hero.
Forgive me, Bakugan.
After the battle with Midori,
I'm not sure
if I was right or wrong.
Tadaroki!
Believe in yourself
and in my faith in you!
Midori!
Damn you!
Yes, yes!
Go on!
If you want to win,
do your best!
The Artillery Hall!
The Artillery Hall!
The Artillery Hall!
He combined a powerful explosion
with a seductive movement,
just like in the battle with Uraraka.
It's just an incredible technique.
It looks like Tadaroki
didn't use the flame
like in the match with Midori.
And he wins!
What?
Didn't you release the flame?
Hey.
Hello.
What's going on?
What's going on?
What's going on?
What's going on?
What's going on?
What's up?
Don't get me wrong.
I told you
I didn't want this victory!
I don't give a damn
about that 1st place battle.
That....
Tadaroki is outside the arena! Bakugo wins!
The sports festival is coming to an end!
And the champion of the first year is...
Katsuki Bakugo from the class of heroes!
Katsuki Bakugo from the class of heroes!
The sports festival is coming to an end!
And the champion of the first year is...
Katsuki Bakugo from the class of heroes!
Wow! What the hell is this?
He woke up and started crushing everything.
Well, you know...
He's still in the first place.
If you put your finger in it, it will bite off your hand.
Ida takes the third place together with Takayami.
But he had to leave due to family circumstances.
Thank you for your understanding.
What the hell?
Everything is so bad. Ida wanted to win so badly.
Yeah.
Uraraka. Midoriya.
It all happened so suddenly and I have to go.
The villain attacked my brother.
Your brother? Ningenium?
Yes.
How is he?
I don't know the details, so I have to go to him.
He is a hero who obeys the rules and helps the weak.
I decided to become a hero because I want to be like him.
Ningenium.
Please.
Let him be fine.
And now we will give medals.
And no one else will give them.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
It's the All-Mighty!
I brought medals!
It's the All-Mighty!
I'm sorry I interrupted you.
These first years are so lucky.
The number one hero watched them.
And now, All-Mighty, give medals to our first years.
Congratulations, young Takayami.
You are very strong.
You are very kind.
You must be able to fight against any enemy and not rely entirely on a miracle.
If you increase your strength, you will become much more dangerous in battle.
Yes.
Young Todoroki.
Congratulations.
Did you have a strong reason not to use your left side?
The battle with Midoriya changed something in me.
And I don't know what to do.
I think I understand why he interested you.
I wanted to become a hero like you.
But I will never achieve this alone.
That's why I have to change.
There is still something.
There is a completely different person in front of me.
You have already changed.
I'm sure you will find what you are looking for.
Yes.
And now, young Bakugan.
Are you serious?
Did you hit him on the cheek?
Well done for keeping your promise.
Well done.
All-Mighty.
This is the first place.
I didn't do it for nothing.
Let the whole world know about it.
I don't care.
This victory smells like a stand-up.
What a wonderful face.
Ladushki.
Society will always follow you.
And his opinion will change with every appearance of yours.
And the face.
Will you take the medal?
Let her be your scar, so you don't forget.
I refuse.
She didn't give up on me.
Come on, why are you like a little one?
I told you to hand her over to Lombard.
And so it will go.
And here are our three winners.
But you know what?
Each of you could dress up on this pedestal.
To do this, you need to compete, grow above yourself and strive for more.
The new generation has already declared themselves.
And in conclusion, I say.
Repeat after me.
Three and four.
Plus Ultra.
Thank you for everything.
What?
All-Mighty, you were supposed to say plus Ultra.
I thought it was worth thanking everyone.
Come on.
You can call your opponent a friend.
I could beat myself.
But on that day it was something obvious.
You're all good.
There will be no classes tomorrow and the day after tomorrow.
I'm sure that the pro, who watched the festival, is already watching you.
We'll discuss all this after your return.
Have a good rest and get ready for school.
Yes!
And then the usual environment began to change.
It will start to change little by little from here.
Don't run in the corridors!
Mom!
Tenya!
What's wrong with Tensei?
Tensei!
Speak quietly and put on a mask.
He is no longer under anesthesia and came to consciousness.
But he is still weak.
Let's start the operation two minutes later and it would be too late.
Tenya!
Mom!
Tensei!
Brother!
You are a good little brother, Tenya.
You were equal to me.
Tenya, I'm sorry.
There is no older brother.
Tensei!
What? Where are you going?
To the hospital.
What? What for?
Wait a minute, didn't you tell your father about this?
Yes.
Why do you want to visit Mom after so many years?
I'll be back soon.
At first he banged, and then ...
It was cool! Just fantastic!
Babah! Bdeish!
Awesome!
Yeah!
Mom!
Mom!
I'm going crazy!
I can't take it anymore!
Every day the children become more and more like him!
Ashota!
His left side is just disgusting!
I can't be near him anymore!
This good will not end!
My very existence put pressure on her.
And I couldn't visit her.
She's still here.
Because of me.
Because of my father.
To become a hero.
Despite everything and doing everything he can.
Everything is fine.
You can become who you want.
I have to talk to them.
To become a hero.
I have so much to discuss with her.
Mom!
Even if she doesn't want it.
I'll save her anyway.
This will be the beginning of my path.
This is what I am.
The continuation follows.
To be continued...
To be continued...
This movie will not end.
This movie will not end.
I'll eat something normal for lunch.
Well...
Oh, Mochi.
What?
The door is not locked?
Ochako!
We're here!
Dad! Mom!
What are you doing here?
To celebrate the end of the festival.
When we saw how you tried, we immediately decided to come.
What? What about work?
We got on the high-speed train!
I'm so happy!
You should have told me!
Seven times? Isn't that crazy?
Well, yes.
I lost consciousness seven times, it seems.
And closer to the last two, I cried out all the moisture.
It seems that you had a harder time than I had.
But in fact, that's the way it is.
I suddenly found out that you have a miracle, and yet so traumatic.
It's just a miracle!
Science does not know the other examples of this phenomenon!
And I have a miracle!
And I'm so happy, Izuku!
I support you, but it doesn't make my heart any easier.
Yes.
I will do what I have to do.
But it made my mom worry.
And to become a great hero, I have to become a hero.
I won't worry about my loved ones, knowing that I can handle everything.
What can I say?
I'm here.
Izuku, let's watch the recordings.
They are in full HD.
I'll watch it later.
Die!
Damn you, iceman!
Katsuki, stop yelling, go to sleep!
It seems that this is a preview.
In the next lesson, we will have to choose our hero names.
Hero names are given for internship.
It will be cool.
Your name should reflect who you want to become.
I already know mine.
But I have no right to do this with my current abilities.
Hurry up.
Yeah.
Next, the choice of hero names.
Many of the classes have already chosen a name for themselves.
Many?
Infinity is not the limit.
Plus Ultra!
Thanks for watching!
