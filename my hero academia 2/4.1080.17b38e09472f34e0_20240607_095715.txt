The world began to be inhabited by superhumans, and about 80% of the people were with these miracles.
In a world full of chaos, a profession that everyone dreamed of, which everyone respected and became prestigious.
Righteous heroes fight against villains and save the world.
Yes, this story is about how I became the greatest hero.
In the world, the heroes will continue to make lives different from the past.
In a world full of chaos, a profession that everyone respected and became prestigious.
The world began to be inhabited by superhumans, and about 80% of the people were with these miracles.
In a world full of chaos, a profession that everyone respected and became prestigious.
But for some reason, I just wanted to be strong on the night of the day when I cried without regret
That's why I was looking for the courage I needed
As cruel fate is destined
And someday it will appear before me
Just for a moment, this moment, if I can breathe
I thought it would be okay
Once again, it's so dark, it's so dark
But inside me, someone is singing
So passionately that I can't help it
Always, I opened my eyes
So that you will never be sad again
A song to become such a hero
Farewell to the shadow of the pen
And the rolling story
The UAE Sports Festival is not far away
By joining the Hero Agency
You will gain more experience and become popular
UAE Festival, where are the heroes?
No, the whole country is closely watching the big events
That's why I brought you here to talk
The next all-powerful, young symbol of the world
Izuku Midoriya
I want you to tell the world about yourself
This is the UAE Sports Festival, the first-year scene
The first round of running with obstacles
Who could imagine that things would take such a turn?
And the first one who returned to the stadium
This is no one else but...
Izuku Midoriya!
Here I am!
The second stage of the UAE Sports Festival is...
The Battle of the Horses
42 students take part in it
The first places will suffer
You will feel it more than once
That's what it means
This is Ultra
Izuku Midoriya, who came to the finish first, was rated at 10 million
What can you do?
Are you crazy?
I'm not in a junior high school, and they look at me differently
I climbed to the top only because of luck
Even so...
You understood everything quickly, didn't you?
Even if so...
Now I have even more burden on my shoulders
Right, all-powerful?
Episode 17 Strategy, strategy, strategy
Now I will explain the rules of the game
The competition lasts 15 minutes
The number of team points is equal to the number of points of its participants
And the riders will wear a bandage with this value on the forehead
The teams must tear off the bandages from the enemies and get as many as possible
The bandages can only be tied above the neck
The more bandages you get, the more difficult it will be for you
And perhaps the most important thing is that even if you lose the bandage or your structure is broken, you can still return to the game
And that means...
There are 42 participants in a team of 10-12 horsemen
They will be on the field all the time
And it will be hot
If you give points to the opponent, you can have more space for maneuver
We can not know without worry
We have to wait for the start of the mine
Of course, the use is allowed
But this is still a battle of horsemen
If you deliberately interfere with the course of the match, you will be disqualified and you will immediately leave the field
Damn it
You have 15 minutes to create a team
The time has started
15?
The final amount of points does not matter to me
The ones I want to be in the team with
It's her and him
That person
At the festival, everything is done to prepare them for the role of the hero
To evaluate their abilities and preparation
What are you talking about?
In our world, in order to earn bread
You need to have an iron grip
And press the nails of others
That was the essence of the race with obstacles
The worst of such actions
Oh, you're small
You were happy
On the other hand
There are many situations when you need to cooperate with the enemies in business
Oh, just like in the battle of the horsemen
Victory for you becomes victory and for others
It is important to understand each other and to combine with each other
You need to set priorities
Training with a partner
And general training with the participation of many agencies
They are engaged in the fact that in the future it will become a routine for them
They have a hard time
Come to me
Hey, Bakugo, come to me
You will be in my team, right?
Wait, what kind of a miracle do you have?
Get angry
Class B miracle, half trouble
He does not pay attention to us
He has a terrible character
But he earned 200 points
And with such a miracle, his popularity is quite explainable
Hello, garage
Todoroki has already completed the composition
Bakugo, come with me to the team
Hair and smoke
My name is Kirishima, by the way
Could you remember?
You have the same hairstyle
Well, will you be a rider?
And who will stand in the head of our wedge?
Who?
Someone with a huge ego
No, idiot
Although yes, I am with my
Shoji
Shoji
I wanted to unite with the girls, but I was sent
Take me to myself
I am small and I can not be the basis of the wheel
And no one wants me to be a rider
With your size and tentacles
You will hide me from everything, right?
Yes?
Yes, after all?
It looks like a plan, Mineta
As I thought
Everyone unites with classmates
Because they are not familiar with the miracles of others
You need to act quickly
Well, what to do?
Everyone will avoid me
This is Ojiro
Sorry dude
As I thought, no one wants to keep the points during the match
The points should be gained at the end
Unlike Todoroki and Kachan, I did not use a miracle
They do not know my power
Deku
Unite
Uraraka
Are you satisfied?
Everyone will chase after my 10 million
If we avoid the rest, we will win
You overestimate me, Uraraka
Come on
For me, it's better to be in a team with friends
What happened to your face?
Nothing
You shine so brightly that I can't look straight at you
I also wanted to be with you in the team
Thank you
It's better to be in a team of people with whom you are short-legged, right?
To the point
I have a plan
You are present in it and
Another person
Iida
Iida
With you in the lead, Iida
We will get a great base for the cavalry
And the ability of Uraraka will make us super mobile
Our maneuverability will increase
Got it
We need a physically strong rider
But I don't know who yet
So we can avoid the attack of the rest with an enviable ease
I didn't expect less from you, Midori
But I have to refuse
I'm being followed by a series of defeats
You are a good friend
But following you, I get lost
I will follow my own way
Not only Bakugo and Todoroki see you as an opponent
This time the victory will be mine
Iida
It has already begun
Each of them is my enemy
Of course
Now I am in the first place
We are not playing a game here
As I thought
You stand out
Maybe we will unite, Mr. Tsar of the mountains
Too close
Who are you?
My name is Hatsume Mei, from the support faculty
Oh, that strange jumping
I don't know you, but uniting with you is not easy
Well, straightforwardness
If I unite with you, then in this competition my role will not be episodic
And this is a great opportunity to demonstrate my super straights with a big bump
I really want this
My inventions are worthy of this
Hey, wait
Straightness, bumps
What are you talking about?
I offer mutually beneficial cooperation
She did not lead with her ears
The support faculty develops gadgets that allow you to enhance miracles
I have so many of them that you will find something useful
Oh, you were interested in this
It is designed according to the image and likeness of the backpack
Well, with my branded modifications, of course
This is like the steaming hero of the fighter, right?
I love him
Really?
Yes, his office was not far from my house
That's how they are already discussing the strategy
I will not darken, the refusal of Ida was a blow under the belt
But with Hatsume and Uraraka
We need the fourth
Everyone has already broken up into groups
No, everything is fine
Our chain does not have enough power
And they should become ...
Deco?
You!
Everyone is looking at the A class
Well, what would it be?
As Tetsuo Tetsuo said, in the A class, there are those who have known the empty bell
Don't you think so?
The whole difference between us leads to that connection with the villains
How can we, the B class, arrange such a situation?
Let's point out to these assholes from the A class in their place
Everyone
The beginning of the competition is coming
Wake up, wipe your head
15 minutes of preparation, the team is almost over
12 wheelers have already lined up in the battle order
Quite interesting teams have formed
I want to hear your battle cry
The bloody battle of U.A. has come
It's time to start
Yes
Uraraka
On the spot
Hatsume
Takayami
I'm here
I'm counting on you
Sounded with the support of the Jam Club
The site of the VK.com group is vk.com slash jamfans
The reason why I chose you all is in our best balance
Kamenari, you will be on the left
Set the uninvited guests on fire
Yao and Rose, you are on the right
You will provide us with active protective coating
Iida, you will be at the front with your magic
And you will be carrying fire and ice in your hands?
No
In the battle
I don't use fire
Great, the teams are ready
Are you ready?
There's no doubt about it
Tessho Tessho
We act mercilessly
Yes
Let's start
Reverse countdown
Three
All of us
Two
Only one goal
One
Start
In fact, this is a fight for 10 million
Midoriya, I'm going after your bandage
Not a slow attack
This is the fate of the walking jackpot
Fate?
Command, Midoriya
Command
Of course
Push the gas and roll over
You can't escape
What the...
Are we drowning?
Is this the miracle of that guy?
Great
Bad
We can't get out
Uraraka, Hatsume, turn around
Is he flying?
Damn it, the support faculty
Follow him
Jira
I know
Takayami
Great job
Shadow, keep an eye on our blind area
Yes, sir
Here you go
Yes
Wow, that's cool
The element of protection we needed
You're just created for defense at medium distances
You're just amazing, Takayami
You're the one who did all this
Let's land
Uraraka makes us weightless
The only weight that needs to be taken into account is the weight of the equipment and clothes
Well, how do you like my straight basses?
They're great, aren't they?
Greatness is also an indicator
They're amazing, Hatsume
Really?
Actually, it's all thanks to my weightlessness
Follow them
Come on, Jiro, the time of revenge has come
Wait, Hagakure, where's your bandage?
When could this have happened?
We're getting as much as we can
Two minutes have passed since the beginning of the competition
How did the epic battle begin?
The battle for the bandage is in full swing
You can close your eyes and aim for lower places
Battle?
No, it's pure water robbery
Shoji?
What?
You?
But it's a team battle
We're getting closer, and we'll be rubbed into powder
What?
What's wrong, Uraraka?
I'm stuck
It's Mineta
Where did it come from?
From the pyramid, Midoriya
Midoriya!
Pyramids are allowed too?
Yes
I didn't expect anything, Midoriya
I'm tired
Shoji, you're strong
Call me father
Mineta's team used the difference in size perfectly
This is the formation of the pharaoh
Midoriya, get out of the way
No
My boots are over
I'm sorry, but we've increased the burst
Kachan
Where are we going?
Damn
Takayami
Takayami
He's out of his wheel
Everything's fine
It's a clear selection
Everything's fine
The rider can't touch the ground
Thank you, Uraraka
It's hard to control
Yes, I know
Such landings are ineffective
The air is our way
We're turning on the survival mode
The ground manoeuvres with Uraraka and Takayami
We have to stand up
All attention is focused on Midoriya's team
The A-class is not slacking
Their skills are impressive
These guys are well-prepared for the A-class
Even watching their clashes is fun
One collision with the villains gave them such a push to development
Let's check the position on the points
It's been seven minutes
The leaders' board is on the board
What?
What?
How could this happen?
All the A-classes except Midoriya are at the bottom
What happened to Bakug?
Two fingers on the ground
A-class
We're out
What did you say?
Give it to me, I'll tear you to pieces
As soon as the first round was announced
it became clear that many would be tied at the foot
Taking into account that there are about 40 people left
we were just holding on in this range
And from behind we watched you and studied your miracles
Think about it
A healthy man would like to stay at the gallery
Did you do this to all the A-classes?
Well, we didn't agree on it
But the idea was good
They're coming
In order not to fight for the temporary leadership
you were like a horse without a driver
And while I'm in the shade, you're swimming in the rays of fame, aren't you?
The victim is a sedentary villain
Will you tell me about it?
How do villains attack you?
With an enviable periodicity of a year
Kirishima, change of plan
Before Deku
I'll knock out all the crap out of these B-classes
Did the B-class have such a well-developed strategy?
They want to put themselves in the best light
By humiliating the A-class
It turns out that they need not only me
Our priority remains maneuvers
Less than half the time left
I think we'll have to sweat
The second half of this ruthless derby begins
The B-class unexpectedly takes the leading positions
Whose head is the cherished bandana?
On my name
The continuation follows
Translation worked with subtitles into a helicopter
Sounded specially for the project Anidap.com
Timing and work with the sound of the Fraxinus
Tech-Cital Jam, we'll hear more
I'm going against the wind
Why am I the only one?
I hated being beautiful
Everything is connected
This is the moment
I have to keep running
I can't get closer to the dream
I just look up
I can't find the answer
Now I want to prove
That we are here
I'll overcome it no matter how many times I cry
I'll hold your hand
It's okay
I'm not alone
I'm not alone
I'll never give up my heart
Scream
Scream
Scream
Scream
Scream
I won't run away anymore
I'll grab it
My name is Tenya Iida
I represent Aklas
And I'm responsible for the announcement
Let's talk about the next episode
I'll crush you
Out of extreme
Your wheelbarrow will not stand
I will not disgrace the name of the hero family Tenya
I will be as strong as my brother Tensei
Again these thoughts of his to the ear
Next, the start of the battle of the wheelbarrow
The motors of Iida work to the fullest
Infinity is not the limit
Plus Ultra
