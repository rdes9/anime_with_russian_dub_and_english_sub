        <pre>The world began to be inhabited by superhumans.
And about 80% of people were with these miracles.
The world was full of chaos.
The profession that everyone dreamed of and that everyone respected became prestigious.
Right heroes fight against villains and save people.
Yes, this story is about how I became the greatest hero.
I'm quite happy...
That's why I was looking for the courage I needed
If cruel fate is determined
If it ever appears in front of me
Just for a moment, this moment, if I can breathe
I thought it would be okay, that heart
Once again, it's so dark, it's so dark
But someone inside me is singing
So passionately that I can't help it
I opened my eyes all the time
So that you won't be sad again
A song to become such a hero
Goodbye, the pin of the shadow
The story is rolling
I will definitely become a hero and make a lot of money
To help my parents
Deku, you are amazing
You are really versatile
During the battle of the horse, I thought that I needed to unite with my friends
But now I realize that it was you who was the reason for such a decision
That's why when Aida told us about her decision
I was ashamed of myself
Uraraka
Everyone is determined to win and do everything they can
This means that we are all rivals, right?
Thus
Our meeting should take place in the final
Episode 22 Bakugo vs. Uraraka
The last fight of the first round
The star of the middle school
But he didn't come out
Katsuki Bakugo from the class of heroes
Against
I will cheer for her
Achako Uraraka from the class of heroes
Round face, is it you who makes things fly?
Round face?
If you want to wait, do it now
Have mercy, don't wait
Midoriya
What strategy did you develop for Uraraka to fight Bakugo?
It was not something definite
Katsuki is strong
In the close combat, it will be difficult to break through his defense
And the more he moves, the more he sweats
Which makes his trunks even stronger
His mobility is also high
But if Uraraka
Will make him invincible
This will give her a direct way to the quarterfinals
This is her only chance
That's why
The only thing that remains for her
Come on!
Start!
Attack
The draw will not suit me
Great!
She just needs to touch him and he will fly beyond the arena
Bakugo will not let her reduce the distance
Kachan will not dodge
He just counterattacks
Die
Kachan
He usually starts an attack with his right hand
Like this
Here
If I can dodge
Uraraka
He burned her
Even against a girl, Bakugo does not know mercy
It's bad
I knew about it, but I did not have time to react
It's time to finish with you
Do not underestimate me
She made her costume weightless and distracted him
Great
If I can use the spell
He immediately reacted
He does not care about such a reaction as he does
Uraraka activates the spell only when it comes to the goal
It will be difficult for her to deal with Bakugo's reflexes
Too slow
Get
I can not watch this
Bakugo, do not tell me that you beat her because you see an opponent in her
I have not finished yet
Uraraka continues to attack continuously
But looking at this
Uraraka
Her tactics did not work and now she is in confusion
What a fool
I can not watch this
Get
I can not watch this
Get
I can not watch this
Get
Man, maybe you can stop this
It is inhuman
I can not watch this
Hey how can you call yourself a hero
Ochame Love
What difference does it make you if you have such a great power
To do not torture her and kick her outside the arena
Achame Love
Stop triste–ª
What are you doing?
Who said anything about cheating?
How old are you to be a pro?
If you feel sorry for her,
then go home.
This is not a place for a woman.
Go home and think about changing your profession.
Aizawa's teacher?
Bakugo is careful
because he knows the strength of his opponent
that he has come so far.
He wants to win.
He wants to win.
He wants to win.
He wants to win.
He won't risk it one more time
for your sake.
That's not all.
This fool
hasn't died yet.
I think the time has come.
Thank you, Bakugo.
Why didn't you give up on me?
What?
Bakugo is helpless here.
And for a pro,
who has been trying to get him out of here
for the longest time,
she was leaning forward
during the attack
and forcing Bakugo to attack the ground
by collecting shards.
Then she narrowed his field of vision
with endless attacks
distracting him from the main thing.
I will win!
Feeling the meteorite rain?
You should've noticed.
She decided to go through such a madness
with all of these shards.
Even if Bakugo tries to flight out,
he'll still keep attacking.
At this point,
I will narrow my field of vision
and...
and win.
I'll keep moving forward like a deck.
I will keep moving forward like a deck.
I will keep moving forward like a deck.
I will keep moving forward like a deck.
Take us further to the Deco stage!
We have to get out of here!
And you always have some kind of plan.
With one hit.
Bakugasharakhnil as it should be!
In a second, the whole plan of Uraraki turned into nothing.
It was close.
That's it, I've reached my limit.
And he wants to get drunk.
Uraraka...
Even if that's the case...
Okay, I've finally become serious, Uraraka!
If it was Deku...
He wouldn't give up!
Uraraka can't move!
My body doesn't listen to me.
Uraraka...
She's already reached her limit.
I can still...
still...
I can!
When I grow up, I'll help you and Mom!
Thank you, Uchako.
But like your father, I'll be happier if you fulfill your dream.
When it happens, take us to Hawaii.
I'll become a hero!
Dad!
Uraraka can't fight anymore!
Bakugasharakhnil passes to the second round!
Take her to the hospital.
Yes, sir.
The eighth fight of the first round was...
Poor Uraraka.
Oh, right, Bakugasharakhnil passes further, hurray!
If you do something, do it with conscience.
Listen, everybody!
Watch your emotions.
The first round is over!
We'll be back after a short break!
Room of expectation number two.
Our meeting is supposed to take place in the final!
Uraraka.
Kachan?
What the hell are you doing here? Get out of here!
Well, actually, I'm the next one.
I wanted to sit in the waiting room.
And, yeah, congrats on your victory and all that.
See you.
That was your idea?
That's a clever plan.
You just want to get me out of here, don't you?
No.
It was all Uraraka's idea while she was getting ready for the fight with you.
You're obviously mad because Uraraka...
got you around your finger.
Hey, Bakugasharakhnil!
Was it hard to make that face?
What can I say?
You were a great villain, Bakugosharakhnil.
Let's go all out and catch the silence.
Dude, how did you get your hand up against such a fragile girl?
I'm not even capable of that.
You're the one who blew up the fireplace.
You know what, Tsu?
And where is she fragile?
There we go, I lost.
I thought I was going to make it to the very end.
Uraraka, how are you? How are your wounds?
Ah, the nurse pinched me, I'm fine.
She didn't use her maximum to not hurt me.
So I have a couple of scratches left.
Damn it, Bakugasharakhnil is a beast!
He didn't give me a chance.
I need to work harder.
How are you?
Come on, it's all in a bunch.
Better than I expected.
Dad.
You're always looking into the future.
And I can't let you lose again.
It's...
The draw of the draw!
Kirishima versus Tetsu-Tetsu!
The winner goes to the quarterfinals!
Tetsu-Tetsu!
And Kirishima wins!
He goes on!
The last trip to the next round is a draw!
My reserve of strength.
I should have eaten more iron.
You were cool, man.
They're so young.
The names of the participants in the quarterfinals are determined.
You can start.
Already?
See you later.
I'm sorry, Deku.
You couldn't prepare for the fight.
No, it's okay.
I'll cheer for you. Good luck.
Thank you.
I'm sorry I dropped it, Dad.
It's okay.
I'm sorry I called you during the tournament.
We saw your performance.
You almost did it.
Our daughter is just amazing.
I didn't do anything.
And it's not amazing.
In the end, I burned out.
And I didn't have a plan.
I didn't do anything.
I didn't do anything.
And it's not amazing.
In the end, I burned out.
And I didn't have a plan.
I didn't do anything.
Dad, my legs are just worn out.
Really?
I can't go that deep.
But even if you lost,
it doesn't cancel the fact that you were close to victory, right?
Next year, everything will work out.
The further you go, the more you will show the potential employer.
One fight is impossible to assess your abilities.
Why are you in such a hurry?
But I want to help you as soon as possible.
Ochako, everything will be fine.
It's okay if you don't hurry.
As I said,
our daughter will become a great hero.
I understood it right away.
Of course, she feels bad.
Even so,
I can't do anything for her.
Instead of this...
I will root for you.
Good luck!
She's encouraging me again.
Come on!
Oh!
Oh!
Where are you?
What are you doing here?
Why are you here?
I saw your fight.
You have a great charm.
Such a gust of wind,
and you just moved your finger.
If you talk about pure strength,
then you can give a cigarette to the Almighty.
What are you...
What do you want to say?
I have to go.
Does the employer know about one for all?
No, based on his words, it is clear that he does not know anything.
In any case, I can't talk about it at every step.
The Almighty must win Shoto.
His match against you will serve as a good training.
So try a little bit.
Even without the miracle of my father?
No.
I will give up his legacy,
taking the first place without my left side.
That's what I wanted to say.
I'm sorry to disappoint you,
I'm not the Almighty.
It's obvious, isn't it?
It's not you.
The Almighty is watching over you, isn't it?
Todoroki.
The Almighty must win Shoto.
Midoriya.
Remember that.
I will make him a hero who will surpass you one day.
They haven't started yet?
I came to see.
What's wrong with your eyes?
You need to go to the medical center.
I've already been there.
It's something else.
Something else?
In this case, I'm glad that you feel better.
Instead of regretting,
you should be inspired by the Nihilist battle.
Yeah.
What's right is right.
Thank you for waiting.
The first fight of the second round
promises to be hot.
The student who loudly declared himself
and left after a small iceberg.
Todoroki Shoto from the class of heroes.
And this guy hardly passed the first round.
What will he show us this time?
Midoriya Izuku from the class of heroes.
Here we are.
Todoroki.
Takayami.
What do you think about this match?
It depends on whether Midoriya can reduce the distance.
Yes.
What can Deku do against the ice?
What are you going to do, Riku?
Look carefully.
Tomura Shigaraki.
They may become a threat one day.
Are you kidding me again?
Izuku.
They both tried to save you, right?
Yes.
And for some reason it seems to me
that these two are very similar to each other.
At this sports festival,
they both showed that they are the best.
They are like two irreconcilable rivals
who fight for honor.
And now Midoriya against Todoroki.
Fight!
The continuation follows.
Scream!
Scream!
Scream!
I won't run away anymore.
Ah!
I will catch you!
Here is the preview!
My match against Todoroki
has finally begun.
I'll break up with you quickly.
Is it true that his right side is incredibly strong?
I told you
I completely refuse
to use this old overlord.
I'm your enemy.
What?
Next, Todoroki Shotanachalo.
He will remember the words that he once forgot.
Endless limit.
Plus Ultra!
