It all started in China, in the city of Tsingtsing.
According to the news, a shining child was born.
From that moment, superpowers began to appear all over the world.
And time went by, and the reason was never found.
The world began to be inhabited by superhumans.
And about 80% of people were with these miracles.
In a world of complete chaos.
The profession that everyone dreamed of and that everyone respected became prestigious.
And this profession...
Now everything is fine.
Why?
Because I'm here.
He's so cool!
When I get my miracle, I'll be like him!
But...
I'm sorry, Izuku.
I'm so sorry.
I was born without a miracle.
I was useless.
Even if I wanted to be like him, I couldn't.
That's right.
I have to give up my dream.
But my hand...
...continued to desperately hold on to it.
And thank you to the people who taught and supported me.
And thanks to them, I'm here now.
And my dream comes true.
There is always a place for failure.
I'll say it again.
This story is about...
...how I became the greatest hero!
My Heroic Academy Season 2

We continue the report on yesterday's incident in the UA training complex,
where students of the Heroic Course were attacked by unknown people.
The attackers called themselves the League of Villains,
and intended to kill the All-Powerful,
who had been a teacher in the UA since the spring of this year.
The police arrested 72 villains,
but the location of their leader is still unknown.
Greetings.
It seems the summer is not over yet.
You will receive this letter, being in good health.
Since the spring, I became a teacher at the UA School,
and decided to raise a new generation.
I thought of finding someone worthy of future students
to pass on my strength to him and help him in his quest to become a hero.
However, before I took the position of a teacher,
I met one young man.
Even without a reason,
he rushed forward where professional heroes, including me, doubted.
He used only what he had with him to resolve the situation.
He didn't even have a clear plan, but he still ran.
That day I had a feeling that it was he who taught me a lesson,
a lesson on what a hero should be like to be called a hero.
That's why I told him,
you can become a hero.
I offered to pass on my strength to him.
The strength that develops with one person
and that goes from one person to another and so on.
The accumulation of strength that merges with the voices of everyone
who needs it and has a brave heart,
one for all.
The young man took my strength without a doubt
and trained to be taken to a hero course at the senior school of the UA.
Although he fought with his new-found wonder,
he made the most effort to make it his truth.
I'm proud of him.
I don't like to boast,
but I don't regret at all that I passed on to him one for all.
However, I am still inexperienced as a teacher.
There will come a day when I will bother you, my mentor.
I will count on you when this time comes.
Take care of yourself.
Times are changing.
I will continue to inform you of what is happening.
Sincerely yours.
The guy is known as Toshinori, right?
Episode 1.
This is the thought of Chako.
The police are studying the data about the group called the League of Criminals.
And there is no one registered under the name of Shigaraki.
In his years with a miracle that allows him to destroy everything he touches,
the same with the villain Kuragiri
with teleportation gates.
They use fake names,
these people with unregistered miracles
who are the waste of society.
You mean we don't know anything?
We have to hurry.
As soon as their leader gets a wound from Shigaraki,
they will try again.
And it will be terrible.
Their leader, right?
What is all-powerful?
It was a bold attack that ordinary people would not have survived.
Even if they were warned.
They appeared suddenly,
and with such statements.
They not only showed their strength,
but they boasted about the NOMO miracle.
And when it didn't go according to his plan,
he changed his mind.
Well, in eliminating this incident with miracles,
I also put my hand, but...
Even so,
it's stupid to refuse such an advantage as an unknown miracle
when you fight the heroes.
They made wild statements,
so indisputable,
boasting about what he has.
He thought that everything would go according to his plan.
Considering what I saw when he attacked,
his portrait looks like this.
As if he did not get rid of the feeling of impunity.
A child in the body of a man.
A child with power?
Maybe he was not taught to use miracles
as children in elementary school.
But what does this have to do with the case?
That day, USJ arrested 72 criminals.
All of them were small cats
who hid in the alleyways.
But the question is,
how did they agree to go after their infantile leader?
In a world full of heroes,
the criminals, forced to hide,
can get to a banal robbery.
So it is.
Many do not know how to use their miracle.
It worries me.
But thanks to the heroes,
we can devote ourselves to the investigation.
We will expand the search engine
to effectively assist in the arrest of criminals.
That person,
in some sense,
he is our student.
He has a place to grow.
If there is someone who is trying
to grow evil in him ...
I do not think he will succeed.
The next day,
after the attack of the criminal league on USJ,
the school was temporarily closed.
But I could not leave it like that.
Have you seen this?
He has already saved hundreds of people!
This is incredible!
Not even 10 minutes have passed!
Just super!
He is laughing!
Now everything is fine!
Why?
Because I am here!
What I am striving for
seems unreachable.
During the attack on USJ,
the criminals played with us
full of anger and strength.
We only interfered
with the teacher Aizawa
and 13th.
In order to resist evil,
I must make the power
obtained from the Almighty
one for all
more than just mine.
After all, we are fighting
with time.
Because I inherited it.
Izuku!
What?
Dinner is ready.
Thank you,
I'll be right back.
Today we have fried pork cutlets.
Hey, did you watch
yesterday's news?
Well, yes.
We were all on the screen for a second.
Did you see?
I did not pay attention at all.
It's true.
It's hard to stand out
when you are invisible, right?
Well, dude, all the channels
made this topic during the day.
I was surprised.
Do you want to blame them?
The course of heroes,
who do not know what would happen
if the teachers did not come on time.
Enough, sir,
just thinking about it, I'm sweating.
Shut up already,
stop whining.
Well, dude, the Almighty was really cool.
He scattered all these super-strong villains.
Yes, his power is amazing.
Guys,
the morning meeting begins.
Stop talking and take your places.
We are already all in our places,
and you are not.
Come on, do not worry.
Tsu, who
will teach?
Well, Aizawa
should be in the hospital,
recovering from wounds.
What?
Good morning.
Teacher Aizawa, you came back so quickly.
You are too professional.
Are you okay, Teacher Aizawa?
Can his condition be called okay?
My self-esteem is not your concern.
More importantly, the battle is not over yet.
The battle?
Really?
Villains again?
The sports festival is coming
very soon.
This is an ordinary school
event.
Sounded with the support of the Gym Club,
the site of the VK group
vk.com slash gymfans.
Sports festival!
This is a super cool event!
Wait a minute.
Is it normal that the sports festival
is held immediately after the attack of the villains?
What if they attack again,
or something else?
Probably, the management of the UAE
wants to show that our management system
is as hard as a rock.
The security will be strengthened
five times compared to that year.
In addition, our festival is
a big event.
It cannot be canceled because of a bunch of villains.
Well, that's a good reason,
isn't it? It's just a sports festival.
Mineta, have you ever seen
a sports festival in UAE?
Of course I have.
But I didn't mean it.
Our sports festival is not
the biggest in Japan.
In the past, Olympic Games
were called a sport festival,
and the whole country participated in them.
As you know, due to the population reduction,
games are experiencing
bad times.
And now for Japan, which took part
in the Olympic Games,
the UAE festival took place.
Of course, all the strongest heroes
will watch it.
To notice the newcomers.
I know!
After the release, the usual thing is
to join the agency.
After that, many become addicted
and turn into eternal mercenaries.
You look like Kaminari
and you will be the same.
After all, you are stupid.
By joining the famous
Hero Agency, you will get more experience
and become popular.
The time is limited.
If you want to become a pro,
your path lies on this event.
One chance a year.
And only three places.
Not a single beginner
hero can miss it.
Therefore, do not postpone
your training.
Yes, sir!
The meeting is over.
Lunch time.
Despite what happened,
I am very inspired.
If we burn there
and show ourselves,
then we will take the first step
to become a pro.
For this reason, it was worth entering the UAE.
We are not given so many chances,
we cannot miss them.
Ojiro, I'm very nervous.
I need to stand out at the festival.
Yes, the pro will not notice you
if you do not put yourself on all 100.
Oh my God, what should I do?
To stand out for me
is like breathing.
So the scouts cannot pass by me.
Am I right?
Yes, sir!
You are lucky, Shouji.
Your musculature stands out
by itself.
There is no point in that,
if I do not show what I am capable of.
I think you stand out too.
Everyone is so interested.
Aren't you?
We came here to become heroes.
Their enthusiasm is understandable.
Iida, you have a unique
manifestation of enthusiasm.
It's strange.
Midoriya, do you feel the same?
Of course.
But something ...
Iida!
Let's stand out at all 100!
Uraraka, your face!
What happened?
You are very serious,
aren't you?
Listen, everyone!
I will try my best!
Yes!
I will show everyone what I am capable of!
Oh, what happened?
You filled the whole space with yourself.
If you think about it,
I never asked Uraraka ...
Uraraka, what?
Why did you decide to enter the UA
and become a professional hero?
Well, because ...
For money?
Do you want to become a hero for money?
If you speak a simple language,
then yes.
Sorry, this is such a reason.
You two have such incredible motivation,
even somehow awkward.
Why?
Is the desire to live a long and happy life
already not worthy of admiration?
Right, although unexpectedly.
My family owns a construction company,
but we don't have a job at all,
so we are poor.
They usually don't talk about this.
Construction ...
If she gets a license,
will her miracle lead to a cost reduction?
She can raise any materials
and will not need any equipment.
Exactly!
When I was little, I talked about this father,
but ...
Do you want to work for us?
Yeah, when I grow up,
I want to help you and mom!
I appreciate this, Ochako.
But as your father,
I would like you to achieve your dreams.
When this happens,
can you take us to Hawaii?
Dad!
I will definitely become a hero
and make money
to help my parents!
Bravo!
Bravo, Uraraka!
Bravo!
Bravo, bravo, bravo!
She not only wants to become a hero,
but also considers life reality.
Young Midoriya, are you here?
Almighty?
Something happened?
Lunch!
Do you want to eat together?
He's like a maid!
What do you think?
With pleasure!
I wonder what's going on.
I wonder what he needs from Deco.
I heard that when
they attacked the Almighty
during the USJ incident,
he rushed to the rescue.
Exactly!
Do you remember what Asu said
on the bus?
You have power just like the Almighty.
They have very similar miracles.
He could like the Almighty.
He's incredible!
Almighty and Midoriya's language.
About 50 minutes?
Yeah.
That's my limit of strength.
I overdid it.
But he was a strong opponent.
And it hurt.
I can hold
the increased form
for about 90 minutes.
About that...
I'm sorry.
You shouldn't apologize.
God, we really look alike.
Here, have some tea.
Thank you.
More importantly, it's a sports festival.
You still can't control
everything, can you?
What are you going to do?
There was an incident
when I hit the attacker
and it didn't work.
Oh yeah, you mentioned it.
Was there something strange?
Strange?
The biggest difference
is that
one of the things I used
was...
my black hole.
I can suck everything
and turn it into dust.
This power
can easily kill.
It was the first time
I tried to use
the power of a human.
Hmm, I guess you managed
to subconsciously slow down the hit.
In any case,
it's a success.
I'm glad for you.
Now drink.
Speaking of purity,
I haven't been a symbol
of the world for a long time.
It's not that long.
It can't be.
And the villains
started to crawl out.
There are some
who are starting to notice it.
I entrusted you with my power
to make you my successor.
I want to be like you.
I want to be like you!
I want to be like you!
I want to be like you!
And become a great hero like you!
Save people with a fearless smile!
Do you still want that?
It should be in the past.
Really?
Of course.
Then it's time to show you.
The Yui Sports Festival
where professional heroes...
No, the whole country
is watching you closely
for big events.
That's why I brought you here
to talk about
the next all-powerful
young symbol of the world
Izuku Midoriya.
I want you
to tell the world about yourself!
I want you to tell the world about yourself!
Next.
Translation is done with the subtitles
in the helicopter.
It was made specifically for the project
called Amphraxinus.
Thank you for listening.
See you soon!
