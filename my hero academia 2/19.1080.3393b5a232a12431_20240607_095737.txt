After the event in Hose, two days have passed, and five days have passed since the beginning of our internship.
My wounds have not healed yet, so I had to stay in bed.
The news went around the clock, reporting about the hero's killer.
After we defeated him, the hard worker intervened and took it all on himself.
His story was agreed with the police.
As the head of police said, we were not presented with a reward.
And our wounds were written off for practice during the internship.
The night Aida received the results of the examination, he went out and went home.
From the road that suffered the least, I will continue my internship.
Hard worker?
I want to get out of this opportunity as much as I can.
In addition, they said that he defeated the hero's killer.
I want to listen to his story.
You won't get into your pocket for words, if it's about the hard worker, right, Todoroki?
I'm sure everyone's talking about it.

Episode 32.
Everyone's internship.
The villains, inspired by the recent incident in Hoseau, will begin to act.
The villains, inspired by the recent incident in Hoseau, will begin to act.
Be vigilant, even in the patrol.
Yes, I got it.
I have one question.
The patrols are called to scare off the villains from committing crimes.
But they have another function.
If we see a villain, we'll take him out right away.
No.
Oh, it's the best jeans. Good luck at work.
The answer is to show yourself to the public.
To calm the population.
To build a trusting relationship between heroes and citizens.
Is this a visit to politeness?
Oh, I saw him on TV.
This sports festival again?
He was caught by the villains, and he was ready to cry.
Why did you scream there?
Have you forgotten what I taught you?
Be gentle. Be gentle.
I got it.
I wasn't caught by the villains then.
I aimed at him and developed a plan.
There was no chance that I would lose.
I am a man who will become the number one hero.
And you don't have to worry about me.
He is too proud.
I like his passion and desire to become a hero.
But this shouldn't flow into such behavior.
And what should I do with you now?
How are you going to resist the enemy with a knife?
Can you attack me?
Are you sure?
Don't doubt it. Everything will work out.
I'll attack.
When someone swings with a knife, it's best to stay at a distance.
If the enemy intends to attack you, you need to change the position of your legs.
Grab him by the hand and neck.
And then put him face down on the ground.
If possible, knock out the knife from his hand.
And then push him away.
He moved smoothly and didn't hesitate.
Gunhead's martial arts are incredible.
But he's still cute.
Well, now I'm going to attack.
We will practice until you succeed.
Do you agree?
Yes. Give me a autograph.
Look here.
If you work hard, you will be able to bloom like a sakura.
Just like the singer Enko, who travels through provincial cities.
I thought hard work had a different meaning.
Social work is also part of the heroic profession.
Don't you dare to be lazy.
Do you understand?
Yes, Mr. Fourth Son.
How many hostages are there?
Two.
Great. Let's start the storm.
Headphones, take out the hostages.
Got it.
Let's go.
Don't be afraid. The heroes are working.
I'll take you out. Follow me.
We are saved. Thank you, hero.
Hero.
Hi, Tropy.
How's it going?
I finished cleaning the front deck.
Aren't you bored training every day and fighting in the deck?
Yes, a little.
My internship went about the same.
The reality turned out to be more gray than I thought.
I'm sorry.
The reality turned out to be more gray than I thought.
The grass turned out to be greener in childhood.
I thought there would be more action.
But it turned out that I had to train, patrol and clean.
And I had to wash the captain's coats.
And where do I become a hero?
Are you tired of it?
At first, yes.
But after I became a captain, I realized
that something was really important for the hero.
What's really important?
And what?
You have to find the answer yourself.
Okay?
Hey, Tropy.
What are you doing here?
Are you going to work all day?
And you, Sirius, I asked you to look after her.
I finished cleaning.
And I'm leading her on the path of the Jedi.
Oh, here it is.
I'm sorry.
Forgive me.
I'm cute, right, Tropy?
She's very surprised.
I've always said this and I'll say it again.
Here's a match for you.
And your face is so cruel.
What?
Get out of my face!
Yes, they like to laugh at you
because you're not cute.
How sweet.
Captain Sulk!
Report to the Coast Guard!
Kroppi, help me with the mooring.
It looks like we're going to the sea.
The apparatus.
Great, you're doing great.
And one, two. One, two. And one, two.
I see. I'm moving out.
The mooring is ready.
Gentlemen, it's time for us to wet our feet in the ocean.
Yes, forward to the open ocean.
Full forward.
We're moving out.
It's decided. We're moving out.
No tickets?
The shore police reported that there were no tickets at the commercial race.
The moors checked everything, but there were no bunnies.
However, after a more thorough check, they noticed that there was not one cargo in the cargo department.
Do you understand what this means, Kroppi?
I think that before the shore police arrived, the moors moved the cargo to their ship and washed it.
It could be the smugglers.
That's right.
That's not nice.
Nice.
Our task is to find and deliver these smugglers.
The shore police is in our hands.
Based on the available information, small ships can moor in this area.
Not only the police, but also the heroes are looking for this boat.
And we are responsible for this area.
The sun is about to set.
You will be looking for it with the help of a radar.
And I'm using the ocean.
Well, that's it.
Get to work, you bastards!
That's right.
The marine rescuer Selkie is a wonder of the seal.
He has all the abilities of a seal.
Using a natural sonar, he can find an enemy in a matter of seconds.
And he's very strong.
They're not here.
We'll have to expand the search area.
As I thought, I don't see anything in the dark.
And I didn't see anything on the radar.
Everything's fine.
The captain is on our side.
A report from the shore police.
A fishing vessel belonging to the smugglers came out of the patrol boat's sight.
It didn't go in our direction.
Captain!
I confirm the presence of this ship in the controlled territory.
Guys!
Turn off the flashlights! I don't want them to see us!
Is that clear?
Captain, the enemy ship is in sight.
Great, let's go to the shore.
And take them on board.
Yes, sir!
What should I do?
Stay here.
Sirius, you stay with her.
Got it.
But then there will be no benefit from my training.
Do what I say.
Let's move out.
Yes, sir!
Froppy, I know you want to go with them.
I know.
But you understand that even against smugglers, we should be careful, right?
So we need to obey the captain's orders.
Let's support them together.
Captain, we're getting closer to the fishing vessel.
Great, give me everything.
Leave everything to me.
Stop the vessel!
Captain, this is Fro.
We represent the interests of the Japanese Coast Guard.
Captain, I didn't find any traces of the cargo.
Their bodies are empty.
What did I say? We're just catching fish.
Open this lock.
There's nothing there but fish.
It's too dark, you can't see anything.
Turn on the light.
I did what you said.
So please don't kill me.
We won't kill you.
Don't worry.
I'm the captain of the Japanese Coast Guard.
I'm the captain of the Japanese Coast Guard.
If we can detain them...
Then it will be easier for the boss to deal with everyone.
We're done here.
See you.
Captain!
Captain, answer me!
This is not good, the radio is not working.
I'll go and see.
Wait.
Sirius, a super-listener.
She hears on frequencies that are inaccessible for the human ear.
Contrabandists...
Another ship.
We're fine.
Find them.
Mik, start the engine.
Yes, ma'am.
If this boat was a trap, then they must be hiding somewhere on the shore.
Hurry up!
I got you.
We're not going to save the captain and the others.
We will follow the captain's orders.
Captain!
Captain!
We will follow the captain's orders.
Because we believe in the captain's choice.
Prope and Tiver.
To the captain.
And to us.
I see them.
They're hiding in the shadows of the mountain.
Damn, in such a place.
Reduce the speed and go into their blind area.
Yes, ma'am.
Prope, I need your help.
They set the clock.
Prope, can you break through their defense?
Yeah, no problem.
What?
What are you...
If you answer our questions, we won't touch you.
Let's go.
Great.
There's another man on board.
He's hiding in the cabin.
I'll get him out.
What the... I don't see anything.
Mik!
Prope!
Serious!
Got you.
Villains.
I thought you had a good trace.
But you're very persistent.
What?
Only a woman and a child are left?
Don't move.
I'll free her as soon as the coast police get away from me.
And you will help me move the cargo.
I'm sorry.
We were locked on a fishing boat, and our engine is damaged.
The captain is on his way.
What's going on?
What's the situation?
Answer me.
Oh, it's a radio.
Hey, kid.
It depends on you, the life of this woman.
Tell them that...
Tell them that...
You can't find the smugglers.
Don't do this, Prope!
Serious!
Hurry up.
Or you don't care about this woman's fate?
What about this?
Huh?
What's really important for the hero?
We follow the captain's orders.
Because we believe in the captain's choice.
Prope, you believe too.
I know.
The smugglers are in the mountains.
Damn it!
I'll kill you!
Stop running!
It's annoying!
I caught you!
Of course!
Damn it!
If the smuggler gets on my ship, he dies!
Boss!
Britons!
Captain!
Sorry for the wait.
Leave the rest to me.
It can't be!
Even if I can't see, I know where you are.
Damn it!
Captain!
Well done!
You're just an incredible captain.
Prope!
How are you?
You're not hurt?
Everything's fine.
And you?
Serious?
I have a very strong body.
Good job.
You both did a great job.
Thanks to you, we caught these smugglers.
Captain!
Thank you!
You did it again.
Sirius.
I'm glad I got my internship at your place.
What's really important for a hero?
Now I understand.
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
That's good.
Arrest all the smugglers!
We took all the illegal drugs they were trying to take away.
By the way, Selke, when did you manage to find a new team member?
This is a student from the UAE.
She's on an internship here.
I see.
Did we make you worry?
I'm sorry.
Hey, don't treat her like a child.
Prope doesn't have a license yet, but she's already a great hero.
I guarantee it.
Well, if that's the case, I hope our paths will still meet.
I'm looking forward to it.
Prope.
To be continued.
To be continued.
To be continued.
I'm back from my internship!
Did you go through a lot during the HoSu incident?
I'm sorry, I wasn't there.
What did you want to tell me?
The time has come.
I have to tell you.
About me.
About the secret of one for all.
About the mission I entrust to you.
Next.
You're listening to this story about my past.
This is a very important series, so don't miss it.
Infinity is not the limit!
Plus Ultra!
