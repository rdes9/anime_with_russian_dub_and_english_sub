Our world is full of people with superpowers. 80% of people on the planet have been born with miracles.
The world plunged into chaos, and the profession that every person on the planet dreamed of became a reality.
A hero who protects people from villains.
Yes, this is the story of how I became the greatest of the heroes.
Superhero James Bond
Why are you smiling?
That's why I was looking for the courage I needed
If cruel fate is destined
And someday it will appear before me
Just for a moment, this moment
If you can breathe
I thought it would be okay
That heart
Once again
It's so dark, it's so dark
But someone inside me sings
So passionately that I can't help it
You always open your eyes
And smile so that you will never be sad again
A song to become such a hero
Goodbye, the pin of the shadow
The story that rolls around
And here is the first match of the final stage of the tournament
The faculty of heroes Midoriya Izuku
Against the faculty of general education Shinsa Hitoshi
The rules are simple
If the opponent is outside the arena
Or won't be able to move, the victory is yours
You can also force him to say, I give up
I give up, then
This is a test of your strength and determination
If you are set for the future, then you have nothing to fear
Ready?
This white woman continued to spread nonsense about her useless pride
Start!
Only complete nonsense will allow you to throw such a chance into the trash
Come on, take your words back
I won
Damn, I warned you
Hey, hey, what's going on?
Deco?
Why did he get up?
What happened?
At the very beginning, Midoriya stopped moving
He can't do anything, he's just standing there like a thug
Is this a miracle to Shinsa?
Although he didn't show anything before
But is he really so scared in battle?
Episode 20 Victory or defeat
Shinsa from the faculty of general education
Could stop one of the best from the Heroic Faculty
Who could imagine that?
Is he really going to reject one of the best?
I've said a hundred times that the entrance exam was poorly worked out
Why?
It becomes obvious if you look at their files
I just took the data of all the participants in the final round
Shinsa completely failed the practical part of the Heroic exam
But he was clearly waiting for it
Therefore, at the same time, he applied for the faculty of general education
Despite the fact that his charm is very strong
He couldn't do anything on the exam because of the competition conditions
After all, the students had the advantage
Having the opportunity to attack the students
Shinsa would not have been able to earn points with his charm
It's good to be as lucky as you, Midoriya Izuku
Turn around and walk outside the ring
What?
What?
Midoriya Izuku!
What?
Midoriya listened to him!
Deku, why are you doing this?
If you go out, you'll lose the match
It's a miracle
Shinsa Hitoshi, the miracle of mind control
The one who answers him will fulfill his orders
But if Shinsa doesn't concentrate on this, the miracle doesn't work
If you compare the results of physical training
Midoriya is one of the weakest on the course
But even without his own charm, he is stronger than Shinsa
If it was a battle of muscles, Midoriya would have won
And yet, knowing him, he could have avoided Shinsa's charm
In any case, the match will now end
Midoriya, my boy!
Come here!
My body is moving on its own
And in my head there is some kind of strange fog
Stop!
Damn it!
Stop! Stop!
Ojiro warned me!
Damn it!
Damn it!
The miracle of mind control?
It's too much of a miracle
Yes, but you have to try to avoid it
I don't remember anything after I answered him
Maybe it works
So at least you can't answer his question
Well, I don't think it's that scary
I said I don't remember anything until the last moment of the battle of the wheel
From the moment Shinsa tore off the bandage from Tetsu Tetsu's head
I came across the wheel of Tetsu Tetsu
And then I woke up
And I was able to control myself from that moment
So a small blow will cancel his miracle?
Apparently so
Although I don't know what kind of power a blow needs
And in a one-on-one battle, no one will help you
So that's all I can say to you
Thank you, that's enough
Maybe it will be selfish
But please, beat him for me
Ojiro
Damn it!
Too much!
Quickly!
Guys, so many people believe in me
And it shouldn't end like this
Like this!
What's going on?
It's moving!
A person like you will never understand
That even with such a miracle I have dreams
Now just lose
Look!
Midoriya stopped!
Midoriya!
I'm so happy!
His fingers
He got rid of the miracle by breaking his fingers
Are you out of your mind?
No, I'm not
I don't understand
What's going on?
My fingers
Are you out of your mind?
How?
You couldn't move by yourself
How did you do it?
My fingers moved
But I didn't move them
But then how?
And what kind of people were they?
What appeared in my head?
Is it really?
One for all
A sacred torch that has been passed down for centuries
People?
Are all these people who used to have this power?
They saved me?
Is it possible?
Answer something!
I don't have time to think about it
I'll think about it later
I'll think about it later
He doesn't answer
Did he understand my secret?
I'm sure it was Belka who told him everything
But there's no choice
We need to talk
Say something
So you have so much power in your fingers
I'm jealous
Believe me, I've been jealous of everyone recently
I've never achieved anything with my magic
But how can such a lucky guy like you understand me?
And wrong
But it's true
I'm lucky
Not everyone is born with such an ideal miracle as yours
You will never understand me
I was lucky to meet people who helped me
And that's why
Answer something
I can't
Lose here
He wants to push me out
Don't be so stupid
It's you who will fly out
I...
won't lose
Shinsa is out
Midoriya goes to the next round
Let's go
God I'm happy
Look, is this real?
Vladimir is here
He doesn't look back
I'm so happy
You can do whatever you want.
And no one will know that it was you.
Just don't control us, okay?
Everyone says so.
Of course, having heard about her, everyone immediately thinks that she was created for evil.
For crimes.
She is good for some villain, they think.
And I'm used to it.
Such is the culture of society.
Well, you know...
Yeah.
The first qualified fight...
...has become Midoriya Izuku!
And I was nervous.
He turned everything in his favor at the last moment.
I didn't expect anything else, Midoriya.
Hey, he threw him like you did back then.
Get the fuck out of here, asshole.
The devil would have taken him.
He definitely planned it all.
He deliberately gave in to him.
The manifestation of his magic on the physical test.
And this is his throw on the practical exam.
Instead of coming up with something new,
he decided to rely on the already tested methods.
Yahoo!
What a boring first match!
But we have to praise them for their courage!
Applause!
Such a lucky guy like you will never understand me!
The one who was so lucky with the miracle will never understand me!
Shinsa, why do you want to be a hero?
Well, you know...
Don't try to cheer me up with your words.
I felt the same way before I got one of the best.
But now...
It doesn't matter what I tell him now.
You were very cool, Shinsa!
Well done!
You surprised me!
You're just the main hero of the general faculty!
You gave this dude the lines of the strongest to disappear as they should!
And besides...
This miracle is very useful for detention.
I want him to our office.
And what did this Yui send to Shinsa?
Apparently, he just wasn't lucky with the conditions of the entrance exam.
It made a difference in the combat experience.
Yeah, it broke the situation.
Too bad.
Did you hear them, Shinsa?
You're great!
This result should be the last one.
You're right.
This result is enough to apply to the Heroic Faculty.
But remember...
Not now, but I'll still get into your faculty.
I'll go through the Hero's course and get a certificate.
And I'll show everyone what an awesome hero I am!
Got it?
Yeah!
He caught me!
Why is he doing this?
The match is over!
A lot of people are afraid to talk to me.
If you're so naive, you'll quickly give up.
At least...
Don't blow on me with a crack!
Shinsa...
Yeah!
To be continued...
Chimokki, Chimokki!
This should help.
In the battle against Shinsa, I couldn't smile.
Well, it wasn't easy, given the circumstances.
But I almost lost.
This is how you fight for the place of one of the best.
Poor guy.
Stop pushing him, you coward!
It was necessary!
Yeah, the All-Powerful.
I saw something.
There were eight or nine people there.
I don't remember exactly.
When my mind was captured, they suddenly appeared like an illusion.
They stood in front of me, scattering fog.
And at that moment I was able to move my fingers.
And one of them had your All-Powerful look.
Could it be the souls of all those who owned everything for me?
What could it be?
What the hell is this?
What? I thought you knew.
Well, in fact, I saw something like this when I was young.
Perhaps this is the transition stage of mastering one for all.
And what does it mean?
I think this is the imprint of those who once used one for all.
I doubt they have their own will that could control you.
In other words, you yourself have broken the control of the mind.
Apparently, under the influence of control, you were able to get together and your subconsciousness broke the illusion.
Well, that was enough to tighten my fingers.
To be honest, I'm not satisfied with this explanation.
Stop thinking nonsense.
You'd better go and start preparing for the next opponent.
Oh, thank you very much.
Yeah, it's okay.
All the best.
Did he say you were there?
Glad to hear that.
Midoriya won.
Get the hell out of here.
Don't be so disrespectful, Shota.
If you used the left side, you could easily beat everyone and win the battle with no effort.
Your teenage maximalism is simply ridiculous.
It's your duty to surpass the almighty.
Do you understand that?
You're not like your brothers.
You're my greatest creature.
Is that all you can say, you bastard?
I'll get it all by using my mother's power.
I will never use your power in battle.
It may work now.
But you'll soon get stuck in the wall.
Oh, Deku!
Well done.
We've got a place for you.
Thank you.
Thank you for waiting.
The next opponent is...
These guys.
He's good.
And he's always got a cunning expression on his face.
Did he come up with something?
Hero's faculty, Sarah Hunter.
Damn it.
Against...
One of the strongest.
He's damn strong by default.
He's got a lot of power.
Let's start the next battle.
Are you ready?
I don't know if I can do something.
Start!
But I'm not going to pray for mercy.
A lightning attack with an attempt to throw out the opponent.
A good decision against such an opponent.
Come on, show him, Sarah!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on, show him, Sarah!
I'm sorry.
What was that?
Why is everything shaking?
What is it?
Don't you think it's a little too much?
Sarah.
Can you move?
Of course not.
Damn it.
Sarah can't move.
Then the hands go to the next round.
No.
No.
No.
No.
Don't worry.
Don't worry.
Don't worry.
Don't worry.
Don't worry.
I'm sorry.
I overdid it a little.
I just got angry.
The phrase, don't worry, filled the whole stadium.
And the look of Todoroki removing his own ice cream
looked very sad.
It looked sad.
The continuation follows.
