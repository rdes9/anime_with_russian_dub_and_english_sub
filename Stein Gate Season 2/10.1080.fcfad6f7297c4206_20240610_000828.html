        <pre>Amadeus and Salieri
Amadeus and Salieri
Curisuiya
Amadeus Mozart, gifted by nature
and considered his rival all his life
Antonio Salieri
Key 331
Mozart Sonata for piano number 11, A major, first part
Do you like Mozart's work?
I exercise sometimes
I like the phrase die means no longer listen to Mozart
Never heard
Strictly speaking, there is no confirmation that Einstein said
You know, I think it's a very logical statement
Logical?
But after all, a person will not be able to listen to Mozart if he is dead
Isn't it obvious?
Yes, it's obvious
If you are dead, then you can not listen
See? Logical, right?
July 28, 2010
Makise Kurisu left this world
Amadeus and Salieri
These two have a special meaning for me
I loved Kurisu
And respected her
I wanted to be like her
Radio Quihabara

All social science, brain, organizational office
Leskin calls for the collection of funds.
If everyone who reads this will donate one dollar, I will be able to buy Odin's bank.
The professor will never be tired of joking.
Yo, Maho! Welcome to our organizational office.
Do you mean the table and the sofa?
Yes. There is one quote.
The preservation of simplicity and the secret of a long way to truth.
And whose quote is it?
Mine, of course.
Well, how about Amadeus?
I just finished the last check.
I think the launch will go without problems.
Can I start?
Of course.
Long time no see, Senpai.
And? No problems?
Nothing.
At least as far as I can judge about it.
Great.
Then I'll tell about this to Akabe.
Okay.
Although I don't think he'll want to talk to me if he finds out that I'm okay.
Do you think so?
I'm sure he likes to talk to you more.
And you like it too.
Stop saying that.
I told you it's not true.
After a long analysis, I'm sure I'm right.
What do you mean?
You just allow this fantasy to develop in your head.
I missed your arguments.
Well, can we start our meeting?
Yes.
Episode 10. Pandora of a proven state. Forbidden cell.
What's going on here?
This room is incredible.
Are you Akabe?
Yes, I am.
What have you turned into a room?
It's even worse than a couple of days ago.
Time changes people and things.
What do you think? Functional, right?
I want to see everything here.
In any case, Amadeus is back to work.
I see.
What's that?
If you want to continue testing, you have to go back to work.
I see.
What's that?
If you want to continue testing, I can send it to you.
Yes, please.
I'm not sure. Are you sure?
Since then, a lot has happened.
I've decided.
It's time to move on.
I wonder why Fairies asked to take Mayuri with them?
Mayuri has a brilliant mind.
I think I understand Fairies.
Maybe she wanted to be cleaned up in the room.
Are they going to clean everything up because of you?
Moreover, maybe she thought that if I came,
I could call this man.
This man?
Sergeant Pure.
Now I'm your instructor.
Call me Sergeant Pure.
Do you want to say no?
Listen.
Until this room shines, you're no more than worms.
All you can do is grow in leaves.
The lowest form of life on Earth.
Do you understand?
What's going on?
It changes a little when it comes to cleaning.
It's a soft word.
As soon as the cleaning is over,
it can become cute and gentle.
Where are you from?
Who is it?
Who of you said it was creepy?
It was me.
What made you laugh?
Listen.
From this moment on, you're a smiling bear.
Do you understand, smiling bear?
Yes, ma'am.
That's better, smiling bear.
And now sweep.
Ten times up and down in 30 seconds.
Yes, ma'am.
That's for sure, ma'am.
He enjoys every second.
What are we supposed to do?
Hiyaji and Kiryu can't leave until we finish.
What?
They didn't tell me.
Order from the housekeeper.
Don't refuse.
It's not good enough.
Did you find out anything new?
No, nothing.
I have an assumption about the attackers,
but I'm sure you won't find out.
You can't let it end like CERN.
CERN?
Forget it.
But it's hard for me to believe it.
I would never have thought that Kurisu was studying the time machine.
But it's true.
I didn't say you were lying.
On the one hand, it seems crazy,
and on the other, it doesn't surprise me.
Salieri?
My user name at the university.
Didn't I tell you?
Yes.
Does it have any special meaning?
No.
I see.
Antonio Salieri.
A man whose life was destroyed by Amadeus Mozart.
Did you know?
Like in the movies?
Yes, I heard about it.
Salieri predicted a brilliant future as a musician.
But he envied Mozart's talent and in despair.
In the end, the poison and pressure from Salieri killed him.
Hiyajou.
Don't worry.
I don't believe it concerns me, but...
Akabe?
We haven't seen each other for a long time.
You haven't changed.
So have you.
Of course.
I'm artificial intelligence.
I don't know.
It's not right.
I'll have to redo everything to my liking.
The others would kill you if they heard these words.
Akarin!
Sorry for being late.
Is she asleep?
Being a sergeant of purity is tiring.
Do you want me to carry her?
Of course.
If you don't want to get a charge of energy from Mr. Tennoji.
Charge of energy!
It must be the cleaning that destroyed his brain.
Well, if you can't find anything, just tell me.
Okay.
Where's Faerie Sequerio?
They said they'd be back soon.
Tomo!
I told you not to call me that.
We're back.
Yeah.
What's in the bags?
She went to the store.
Sorry, but we can't have a boy today.
Even Tomo.
We can't have a boy?
Yes, but we have a plan today.
A secret party of girls-golds for the whole match.
The one who falls asleep has to reveal the secret.
What are you thinking?
Where's your delight?
Come on.
I chose some expensive ice cream cake for us.
Well, okay.
The thing is that Maha is beautiful like a doll.
You like everything.
Stop calling me that.
What?
Kiryu?
Finally smiled.
Stop it.
What a cool chest.
They just beg to be tickled.
Stop it.
Now I feel disobedient.
Stop it.
I don't like it.
No.
Sokonya brought it to us.
What the hell?
What are you writing?
A note for the novel.
A novel?
Are you a writer?
It's just that I'm not special.
Almost anyone can replace me.
What are you talking about?
You are you.
No one can replace you.
But...
You can't be replaced.
So don't underestimate yourself.
Comparing yourself with others and feeling incomplete.
It's like...
It doesn't matter.
I think she liked it.
Stop it.
Since then, a lot has happened.
It's time to move on.
Why are you like this?
This board is as good as a work of art.
Is this the AFX-008 image sensor?
Where did it come from?
Who knew that there is such a place in Kehobar?
This looks like a real mahogany.
Who would have thought that it is so detailed.
I like to collect things.
When I was little, I used to collect all kinds of things.
But now I don't.
I like to collect things.
When I was little, I used to collect plastic Japanese models all the time.
Did you collect German radio?
I even burned myself while I was singing.
It happens to everyone.
Exactly.
I think only you two.
Why didn't I come here before?
You should have told me.
I didn't think you liked it so much.
Are there other similar places?
There used to be such stores everywhere.
But lately, what is more important,
didn't you want to talk?
We can postpone it.
You're not busy, are you?
Let's go for a walk.
Everything is fine with me, but...
Wow!
Try it!
Mascot of the channel?
Mascot?
You know what?
Ukurisu was alone in her bedroom.
Ukurisu?
Did she bring him to America?
Senpai, stop talking!
This box with mascots is for you.
What are you talking about?
What kind of Mascot of the channel?
Never.
Don't give up.
KB!
You deserve it.
I don't mind if I try.
I just need to use the claw and throw it in the hole.
Great.
Why?
Why does it violate all laws of physics?
Otherwise, they would not benefit.
But I'm sure I can do it.
For the second time, for sure.
We need to take the trifle.
She's definitely got carried away.
It's not the time to say that.
What?
Now you can prove that you are a man, Akaba.
Me?
Okay, I can do it.
The employee came and relaxed him.
Here, take it.
Are you sure?
Of course, I don't need it.
Well, in that case...
Did you want him so badly?
What did you want?
After Kurisu's death,
her mother knew how much she loved him,
so she took him to her room for decoration.
But he burned in the fire.
I didn't know.
So I want to bring this to Kurisu's mother as a gift.
Is that okay?
Of course, it's good.
Don't you want to go inside?
There are racing games there.
I can't believe we've been there for so long.
Oh my God.
I didn't know you were so good at racing.
Maybe I got a little carried away.
So, what's next?
Shall we go for a bite?
No.
It's pretty late.
But there's a place I want to visit before I go back to America.
Radio Akihabara.
That's...
That's right.
The place where Makise Kurisu died.
Her last place.
If you don't want to, just tell me.
I can go alone.
No.
It's so quiet here.
Most of the shops have moved,
because they are going to rebuild it.
It is no longer used.
Come here.
Hurry up, it's late.
I've got an idea.
No.
Good morning.
Hello, Timur Yakovlevich.
Right there.
Right here.
I see.
So it's here?
Curious.
I'm not a physicist or something.
That's why I don't know the details of the theory of relativity, but...
If space and time are one, why can we move in space, but not move freely in time?
Right now I'm in the space where Curious died.
But I can't change anything because time is inaccessible to us.
You can't stop it.
What?
Even if you come back in time, you can't change anything.
Why are you so sure?
We discussed this with Curious.
I see.
With Curious.
Ukabe! Ukabe!
Ukabe.
Forgive me.
Forgive me.
I'm sorry.
It's my fault.
I don't have enough delicacy.
You took so much care of her.
No.
Don't worry.
Hey.
Did you really meet her at the seminar?
It seems everything was wrong.
From time to time, I wonder how long you've known each other.
One month?
Two?
No.
You talk as if you've known her much longer.
It's...
How do you know so much about Curious?
I...
I just...
Curious...
I'm sorry.
I understand.
I can tell you something happened and you don't want to tell me.
That's enough for me.
Hiyaji.
Every time I see you, I think...
Why are you always so sad?
It's the same when you talk about Curious.
And even if you talk to the guys,
it's like you're sorry about some choice.
It's like you're fighting alone against something.
And when Mayuri and I...
As if you tried to protect us from something.
And the thing is...
So that's how you see it.
Yes.
I won't ask you to tell me everything.
But...
I want to support you and help you.
So...
So what?
I promised myself that I wouldn't tell anyone.
But I can't.
I...
I have...
I have to...
I have to...
I have...
Curious.
The legacy of Makise Curious.
The legacy of...
Curious?
Yes.
I have her laptop.
With all her research data.
With her theories.
And personal information too.
Her personal computer.
The thief who broke into my house must have been looking for it.
Where is it?
I couldn't figure out the password, so I gave it to a reliable person to analyze it.
Impossible.
This computer is Pandora's box.
You can't open it.
The data inside will lead to the destruction of the whole world.
What are you talking about?
I already said.
Russia and America are fighting each other in a race for a time machine.
Both countries are doing everything possible to get these data.
This is the reason for the Third World War.
The Third World War?
What are you doing here?
You're killing us.
The End
