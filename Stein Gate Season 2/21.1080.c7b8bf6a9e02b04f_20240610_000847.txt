Theoretically, this is possible. However, this is only in theory. Only the psychological load will be colossal.
Come back in 2011, even with the refinement that allows you to jump right away for two weeks.
In order to come back a year ago, you will have to jump 20 times.
In the end, you will have to jump for 48 hours, just for two days ago.
What does that mean?
You have to move about 3,000 times.
That's a crazy number.
Are you ready for this?
Yes. There is no other choice if I want to change this world.
Looks like you're ready.
We haven't seen each other for a long time, Akabrentara.
Kurisu?
She was constantly watching your condition while you were in the coma.
Ramadeus?
It's the least I can do, because I'm not a fighter.
But still, after 11 years...
Time is insignificant. Such an observation does not work for me.
Besides, she will accompany you during your long jump.
It doesn't matter how far you jump.
Until 2025, every time you wake up, she will be by your side.
Although this time you woke up and broke my terminal.
When you wake up, if you say you moved in time, I'll try to help.
Just say you want 2011.
What?
Nothing. I just remembered an old, but similar conversation.
I won't beat them anymore.
Mayuri said it was wrong to press on me.
And then... her kindness became my excuse.
However...
I can stand here only thanks to others.
Because they are close.
Because they didn't give up here.
I couldn't handle it alone.
I also want to take care of the future for others.
Ready?
Go ahead.
Let's go!
Akabe, are you awake?
Akabe, don't rush.
You've been unconscious in coma for the last 11 years.
You need to get up.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
You've been unconscious in coma?
You need...
Listen...
I came... from the future for two weeks in advance.
What? From the future?
The hell would the future do to me?
Listen...
I used a time machine to move here.
I saw Daru and Hiyaji.
It's 2036 now.
I know everything that's going on in this world.
And you...
And you've been watching me for 11 years.
What?
Well...
It's hard to believe.
Believe me.
It's true.
Are you really from the future?
Help me.
Okabe, you...
Kyouma!
Sorry to bother you.
Okabe!
Kyouma!
Okabe!
Akarin!
So you're really awake?
Daru, Hiyaji, did Amadeus tell you about him?
Yes.
Are you serious?
To come back in 2011?
I know very well that it will take about 3000 jumps.
So you're really...
Akarin...
Please.
I think you'll have to talk about it again and again.
After every jump.
And not only will he feel the pain of every waking up.
Have you finally decided?
Okabe...
Rukako.
Yes?
No fixed future?
Don't give up.
There will always be a way.
Okabe?
Are you awake?
You'll say, don't rush, right?
And then you'll say that I was in Pome for 11 years.
You...
You won't be able to repeat this anymore.
Because you're not here for two weeks.
And where am I?
I don't know.
Two weeks ago, you were captured by a peacekeeping squad.
Only yesterday we found you in such a state and were able to save you.
So, except for today and the day two weeks ago...
You won't be able to jump.
You won't be able to jump.
I doubt that you will be able to answer the call as soon as you are caught.
You won't be able to do anything until you are rescued and connected to the monitoring terminal and Amadeus.
I'm sorry.
If we had rushed and pulled you out a day earlier, you would have had more time in reserve.
In this case, I'm to blame for not being able to improve the time machine.
Two weeks is all I can do.
336 hours is not enough.
It's sad.
That's not true.
I'm very grateful to you for achieving such a result.
Even Kurisu, she stopped at 48 hours.
You should be proud of yourself.
Exactly!
This is not the only problem.
If the time machine affects the world line a little, the present can be changed and you may die in the end.
That's what changing the past means.
I know.
Even so, I'm jumping.
I've been jumping for 11 years.
I'm going to do hundreds of jumps.
And with the help of my friends, I will achieve everything.
Okarin-san!
I'm glad you're okay.
Yuki...
Listen!
You all fought with all your hearts, regardless of time.
Please don't give up!
The future...
I'll show you that you can change it.
Start!
Go!
Okarin!
Kyouma, we're heading to the meeting place.
Hurry up!
This is Ferris.
Akabe?
Aren't you on a mission?
Listen to me.
I've arrived from the future.
What?
I know it's hard to believe, but there's no time.
Believe me, I need your help.
What kind of help?
Today I will be captured by the Bureau and tortured.
And then I will die.
What should I do?
How can I...
How can I avoid this fate?
We know why you were captured.
You told us yourself.
Akabe Rintaro died in 2025.
Until now, you used it in your interests and lived.
If today is the day,
it means that the convergence of the world line that helped you
turned against you.
It doesn't matter what you do.
Convergence will lead to the fact that you will be captured.
Even so...
Akabe!
Can you give me 10 minutes?
I have a plan.
Okay.
In these 10 minutes,
remember the map with the enemy's positions.
What does it mean?
Usually, I direct you to a safe place.
But if you assume that this is a trap,
there is a high probability that I am responsible for your death.
That's why...
Don't delete the Amadeus app.
And take out the battery, just in case.
It can confuse them.
And also...
Use the bait?
I refuse!
Calm down.
You arrived from 2036 jumping all the way.
Right?
Yes.
So you saw that they were all alive in the future.
They won't die here.
But how?
Everything is fine, Kyouma.
Kunya told us.
We are all running in circles around the city.
Kyouma must run to Akabe and get to the time jump machine.
It's dangerous.
Akarin!
Now you should believe in us.
We don't see the target.
They disappeared from the GPS.
Apparently, the Amadeus turned on.
Team 1 and 2,
go there immediately.
The priority is to capture the target.
Ignore the rest of the Valkyries if necessary.
So far, Kabarentara...
The target is captured!
Wait!
It's...
What happened?
There are several Kabarentara markers on the map.
Two?
Three?
No, they appear everywhere.
What does it mean?
I don't know.
Amadeus suddenly appeared.
Rintaro...
I will not give up.
I will not lie to you anymore.
I will not pretend that I made the right choice.
I will not compromise anymore.
They all fought.
Move my hopes and save our world.
I believe in their hope.
Hope is my strength.
I will show everyone that we can achieve another world.
Akarin!
Uncle Akarin!
Okabe!
Kyoma!
Okabe!
Okarin!
Akarin!
Okabe!
I can do it!
Akarin!
What happened?
Daru!
What?
Hedge!
Hit me!
What? Again?
What are you doing?
Don't hold back.
Think about all your anger because of me.
Feel Suzuhi.
Feel it and hit me.
What's wrong with you?
I deserved it.
I just put my head in the sand.
I ran away in fear and deserved it.
Are you sure?
Hoshida!
Yes.
Do it!
Okabe!
What?
Yes, it worked.
Less than I expected from my beloved right hand.
I came to you from the future.
What?
Akarin?
You're wrong, Daru.
That's a laugh.
What?
My name is Kyouma.
Kyouma?
Yes.
I'm an employee of Lab 001.
I'm its founder.
I'm the searcher of chaos.
I'm the destroyer of the structure of this world.
I'm a mad scientist!
Houen...
Kyouma!
Okabe...
Akarin!
What?
You're a lolly girl.
What?
Yes, you.
There's another lolly here besides you.
Cloth.
Bring the cloth immediately.
What the hell?
Oh, yes.
Look at my sacred silver armor
when my hands slip into the sleeve and wake up from sleep.
Hoshida, what is it?
He's back.
Old Akarin.
He's choked and crazy.
He's talking nonsense.
Our leader Akarin is back!
You both have completed the time machine.
My presence is proof of this.
Lolly girl!
Don't call me that.
From today on,
I give you the title of lab employee 009.
Now you're in the hands of Houen and Kouma
and you'll help in our operation.
I'm Josephine.
Who the hell is that?
I call the meeting of the round light.
Call all the employees immediately.
What's going on?
I don't know.
Can you explain why you gathered us?
Kouma!
Announcing the start of a new operation.
For her success, every lab employee must do their best.
Where's Major Suzuha?
My sister wrote that she's busy.
Shina and...
Don't be afraid.
Everything went as planned.
Nevertheless, the operation continues.
Oh, the red star I saw...
I'll call her.
Operation VEGA!
Restore Amadeus data?
Yes.
I'll confirm if I need to.
She already installed a message on the dog channel
and Leskinen hid her.
What?
Professor?
Why him?
Exactly!
They broke the occult wall!
The organization has already put its hand down
and shut down the connection in the entire Akihabara.
However...
Ferris!
Yeah?
Set up a watch around the radio building.
Several suspicious foreigners are noticed in this area.
Gather information about everyone.
We'll have to rely on the taxaphones.
Understood.
Radio building?
I know that the soldiers on the stand and Mayuri are heading there.
Let's stop them!
Even if we all interfere.
The end of the emergency will be the same.
If there is a way to stop them...
Oh, yeah.
What?
Yeah.
That's me.
Right.
The only goal of the operation is to ensure the safety
of Mayuri and Suzuhi's past.
I know.
I don't want to repeat this mistake.
El...
Psy...
Konguru...
Mr. Brown!
What?
What's wrong with you?
I thought you were okay.
I don't have time to explain the details.
The connection failure.
The organization's case.
Stratfor.
DARPA.
I need your help, Mr. Ferdinand Brown.
Well?
Everything as Karen said.
She's not here.
But if I can find out where...
I'll leave the tea here.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
It's the least I can do.
It's not true.
Remember what he said?
Rukaku, you need to support them.
Support?
Yes.
It's an important mission that requires strong-hearted attention.
I don't understand why everyone is so happy about the return of the old Okabe.
But I think I understand now.
Finally!
Be sure I found her!
Mission complete!
Urushibara!
Tell the others!
Yes!
You have one missed call.
Hello?
Kyouma?
Hashide has just found Amadaus and is about to restore her.
Don't hesitate.
Great.
With this...
Wait for me, Mayuri.
I'll save you.
That's right.
Ouch!
Quiet.
You're only affected by the ricochet, but there's still blood.
Great.
Just think about it.
She did it herself.
The technology and control of the mind in the future are incredible.
You...
You made the Toskagari!
Exactly.
Valkyria Hashidasu.
Kakari was a spy for a long time before you moved with her.
This is the merit of the future me.
Your anger is justified.
But I don't have time to have fun with you.
I'll help you.
Soon you won't be bothered by the bitter future or the hard past.
Or...
You want me to clear your mind?
Exactly.
A small interference in your brain and...
What?
Rintaro.
Uncle Okarin?
Okarin?
How did you end up here, Rintaro?
Who are you?
I'm Amadaus.
Who are you, Rintaro?
Who said...
Kagari won't come.
Because we've already dealt with her.
Maybe you haven't realized it yet,
but we took measures to secure the building.
Mr. Leskinen,
maybe you consider yourself an all-seeing god,
but I can see that all your plans have been ruined right now.
Rintaro,
what do you...
What do you think...
Okarin?
Lab employee 002.
Mayuri's tire.
Operation Arclight.
I came from the future,
and I know everything.
Okarin?
I don't know what they'll do to this place in 30 minutes.
Hurry up!
Uncle Okarin!
I'll deal with Kagari.
Take care of Mayuri.
Okarin?
Got it.
They must...
They must be in time.
The time machine will disappear into the past,
following history.
It's impossible.
It's too early.
Mayuri!
The End
