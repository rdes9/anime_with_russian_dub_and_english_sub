It's been a few months since the Cogar went missing.
We tried all possible ways to track her whereabouts, but...
In the end, we never found her.
Meika and I didn't make it either.
We didn't even know where she was.
We didn't even know where she was.
We didn't even know where she was.
Meika and I didn't make it either.
We didn't even know where she was.
Did you... brainwash her?
We don't have any proof.
Since we don't know anything about Cogar,
we can't ask the police for help.
Okarin?
Mayuri?
Are you ok, Okarin?
What?
I thought you didn't take an umbrella.
It's been raining so suddenly.
Especially lately.
It happens in rainy seasons.
It can't be helped.
You're right.
Summer is not far away.
You're right.
Summer is near.

Go!
Go!
Yo, Masha. What happened?
Good morning.
Are you serious?
Of course!
As I said, if we don't have the opportunity to use the time machine, we need to create an alarm.
Do you think it's feasible?
I've already reached the point where Karin disassembled it and threw it away, but it's not stable at all.
Of course not.
How could they squeeze a huge amount of data and send it to the past?
Until you find out, it's pointless.
That's why we contacted you.
We need your help.
Since we can't ask Uncle Karin, we need you.
Don't think that I'm all-powerful just because I'm a scientist.
You were Maki Sakurizuka.
You had the brains of this genius.
But I think you're a genius on your own.
Get me out of this mess.
I have to work.
So...
That means no?
Bye.
Salieri won't be able to write Mozart's song.
I'm not Mozart.
Did I say that in such a video?
Episode 14.
Confession at the limit of elasticity.
To predict or to recognize.
Interesting.
Do you think everything is fine?
Karin will be angry if he finds out.
So you want to convince him?
Impossible.
He'll give him to scrap metal as soon as he finds out.
You think?
You know, Karin is always so serious when he talks about it.
Don't even think about changing the future.
I think he has a reason to say that.
I guess I can understand why he thinks so.
But will the Third World War allow the right choice to happen in this line?
I doubt it.
I'm sure Karin agrees with you.
Then why is he inaction?
He has a time machine to get to Wartstein.
He can remember the events of other timelines with the help of the reading Steiner.
So why did he give up?
Why didn't he at least try?
Why?
I don't think he gave up.
I think Karin will be reborn and will laugh.
As before.
You say so.
It's been more than half a year.
Well, it's just...
We can't rely on Uncle Karin.
It's time to start acting.
I'm sorry.
You entrusted it to me, but we didn't come to anything.
No.
I know how hard you worked just for me.
Mayusha wrote.
What?
What?
She said that Fubuki got into the hospital again.
I'll go find out what happened.
Mom will be there.
Good luck.
It's not the time to worry about it now.
But if it turns out that I don't appear in the light...
I won't let you down!
See you later, Dad.
Right! I'll try!
It's...
Tokyo Central Hospital.
Mayusha! Karin!
Fubuki, are you okay?
What?
I'm okay.
They asked me to come back to the hospital for another examination.
And then stupid Kaede...
Because you wrote that you were put in the hospital for some time.
I told you it wasn't for long.
In other words, there's nothing to worry about.
Thank God.
Karin! Mayusha!
Daru.
You came too?
What happened?
Hashida.
What?
Good evening.
What?
Hi.
Didn't Fubuki get hurt?
Oh my God.
And why does everyone need a separate room?
I'm telling you, you just need it.
Even if you say so, it's impossible.
Then create this opportunity.
Professor Laskinin?
Huh?
Long time no see.
Rintaro!
Wait, no!
Professor, do you know him?
Yes.
This is the third Einstein in the world.
Rintaro will have to come to our university in September.
And I want to ask him to join my research group.
University of Victor Chondria?
No, that's my ultimate goal, but...
Mayusha, mayusha!
However, the fact that you can go abroad...
Karin is being transferred abroad?
I'm not sure for sure, but I'm sure that Karin is trying very hard...
Yes, thank you very much.
...for your studies.
I see.
What? The director of the hospital?
So you lied to him?
I never lie to Rintaro.
Although I told him about September.
Yes.
But I didn't tell him what year it was.
Hiyaji came too?
You're interested, aren't you?
Well, maybe.
Unfortunately, she stayed in America.
However, I will tell her that you asked about her.
Take care of yourself.
To tell you the truth, the only reasonable assumption is that
they sent this memory somewhere for compression.
Given the organization with which she could cooperate and be able to do so...
Make one wrong step, and you will disgrace all the dead forever.
One step, and everything will repeat itself.
New message.
Professor?
What? Okabe?
What the...
Did something happen to you?
Exactly. The professor is in Japan now.
He must have met Okabe by accident.
Do you want to be there?
What do you mean?
Your eyes are full of blood.
Lack of sleep.
After all, he's such a strange guy, isn't he?
Why?
It seemed to me from the very beginning.
The first thing he asked was if it was possible to build a time machine.
Time machine?
Is it possible?
Senpai?
Listen.
You have memories of Makise Kurisu from last spring.
Before her trip to Japan, right?
Right.
Why are you interested?
If...
Suppose if...
If you could find a way to create a time machine.
A time machine?
And everything you need right in front of you.
What will you do?
What a stupid question.
Isn't it obvious?
But...
The one who made it possible
says that
a time machine is the work of the devil.
It shouldn't exist.
I see.
I can doubt it.
After all,
no one knows for sure
what can happen to the past
and what will happen to the present.
We have no idea.
You're right.
Although...
Even so,
I would connect everything.
Use it or not.
Difficult choice.
Did she leave it half a year ago?
No.
Impossible.
She was here.
I think it's time to take a shower.
Don't move.
If you move,
I'll shoot you.
Put your hands behind your head
and slowly come to the door.
Wait.
It's very hot right now,
but you're still wearing that costume.
Why don't you take off your helmet?
Kagari?
I hear God's voice.
I hear something.
Kagari?
Where is he?
A precious gift
from Mom.
Kagari.
He's with you, right?
Give it back!
It's hard to believe
that you're the same girl
who was crying in the time machine.
I'm surprised.
My sister
was crying.
Mom was crying?
Take care of yourself.
I won't touch you.
Sister.
It hurts.
It hurts.
Sister.
It hurts.
Suzuka, what happened?
You left the door open.
What?
Watch out!
Don't move!
Don't move!
Watch out!
Dad!
Kagari!
Come on,
hurt my father.
I don't care who you are.
I'll finish you for that.
Kagari!
What was that?
Was that Kagari?
Right?
Yes.
But why Kagari?
Did you see Suzuka?
I think
she was crying.
I'm sorry.
You don't want to go to the hospital?
It's okay.
I was just hurt.
Just think.
That mysterious woman
turned out to be Kagari.
No.
That time another person attacked you.
When it happened,
Kagari was in the temple.
So?
I think
Uncle Okarin was right.
Kagari was brainwashed
and she was controlled by someone else.
Brainwashed?
But who?
12 years ago.
Someone found out that Kagari
was in the time machine
and took her.
What?
I heard
the voice of God.
I heard
the voice
of God.
What?
It can't be.
Kagari already?
Then
I'll contact
Karin
and tell him about Kagari.
Uncle Okarin,
if he finds out that Kagari
has appeared, he can
start looking for her again.
But you know,
Kagari is too dangerous now.
In addition,
if she was brainwashed,
I have some assumptions
about it.
Perhaps,
to save her,
Kagari will have to use
the time machine.
Idiot.
Why didn't I remember
it right away?
He tortured my comrades one after the other.
The president.
The professor.
Dad?
I'll try
to talk to Maha again.
Let's do it together.
Together with you,
we'll develop
a new time machine.
Don't worry.
I'll do everything
I can to finish her
no matter what.
In Japan?
We can't do anything
without your help.
We need it to save the world.
And if you come,
I'll be able to watch
Loli Maha in summer clothes
in all white and high socks.
Dad!
Oh, I'm sorry.
Imagination took over me.
But seriously,
without you, I will never be able
to restore the TV.
Will you really do that?
I'll say it again.
We need your help.
Give me some time to think.
I've never been
into details.
But there must be
Makise Kurisu and Okabe Rintaro
in the other world line
again and again
through trials and errors.
They were unable to
manipulate time.
She did it.
Makise Kurisu built it.
Do you believe that?
She published an article
at such a young age.
Great!
Your talent is a real find.
Now that the world has recognized you,
they think you will be very busy.
Just unlock it.
Prove that I can look inside.
Prove that I can do it.
Make one wrong step
and you will disgrace
all the dead forever.
I...
What should I do?
Some problem, Senpai?
Senpai?
Are you worried about something?
If you don't mind,
I can listen to you.
Thank you.
Senpai?
Kurisu, help me
find something.
One old magazine.
What?
Okay.
And then...
I can find my way
on my own.
I can find my way
on my own.
Not by searching for answers
in your work,
but by following the same path
and achieving it on my own.
That's why
I will go there again.
To the city where Makise Kurisu died.
It's hard to express the reason in words,
but I think
if I was asked to answer,
I would do it.
One person recognized Mozart's talent
above the rest.
It was Salieri.
It was Salieri.
