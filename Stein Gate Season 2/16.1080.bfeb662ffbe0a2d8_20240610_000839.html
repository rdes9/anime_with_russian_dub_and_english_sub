        <pre>Hey, what are you doing there? I'll raise the pay!
Window! Open the window!
Okie dokie!
Damn, I didn't expect that.
Why did it suddenly light up?
Maybe it's because I took it from the trash?
I don't know.
Maybe it's because I took it from the trash?
Maybe it's because I took it from the trash?
Maybe it's because I took it from the trash?
I don't know.
Maybe it's because I took it from the trash?
You're right.
We need to turn on the condor.
We can't.
If we turn everything on together, the fuses will fly off.
What kind of trash is this?
And you call this a lab?
This name was invented by Corinne, not me.
Did Kurisu really manage to do something in a lab like this?
Denki University of Tokyo
The End
The End
The End
The End
That's why, as you can see on the 21st page of the textbook,
direct and indirect, depending on the words, can...
Okay, let's continue next time.
And by the way, Akabe.
Yes?
Corinne!
Sorry, I'm late.
It's okay.
The professor wanted to talk.
Yes.
It looks like he's also interested in Daru.
He wants to meet him.
Really?
So you need a superhacker.
Do you want to have a bite?
What?
We're not going to the lab?
Daru should be there.
Can I just write to him?
Well, I think he'll be happy if you tell him personally.
Besides, so much has happened between Daru and Yuki.
Do you know what I think?
He needs to talk to you for a while.
Yes, but later.
Your normal life will start soon.
I wouldn't say so.
But I have a chance.
So I'll try to go abroad.
Okay.
So that's what you want.
Yes.
Then I think you should try.
It could be a chance for Daru.
Plus, if I'm transferred, I can help Hiedzu.
For everyone, such an exit will be better.
Oh, right, look, look.
This is Suzu.
Don't you think she looks stupid?
Yes, there is such a thing.
By the way, this is the lab coat you were wearing.
It keeps you whole and safe.
It can be used.
Nothing like that.
What?
But when I wanted to give it to Suzu last time, you got very angry.
What, really?
It's just a cheap coat.
It's already green.
My wife remembered that she has a lot of things to do.
Really?
Hey, Okarin.
What is it?
No, it doesn't matter.
See you.
One new message.
Stop it.
Stop it.
You can't force him.
Why?
Why does Okarin have to change the future?
I'm sorry.
I forgot my umbrella.
It's okay.
It's good that I walked nearby.
Let's share the umbrella like we're in love.
You're embarrassing me.
Wow!
What a great decoration!
It's already the season.
I make it every year.
I even buy a bamboo branch.
Really?
And you write your wishes?
Yes.
When I was a child, I always wanted to be an oricheme.
In the end, I'm just a romantic.
You'll become one, I'm sure.
What?
Oricheme for Okabe.
What?
I didn't mean Okarin.
Mayuri,
you've been supporting him for so long.
You're a great match.
You're wrong.
Not only Mayusha has Okarin in her heart.
What?
Oricheme and Okarin
never shine again.
Mayuri?
You're such a kind hand.
No, you're not.
It's just that that's all I can do.
It's hot.
In a few minutes I want to do another experiment.
Okay.
And if you dare to look at me, I'll call Suzuhi.
Don't worry about it.
I don't think my heart can take it.
What?
Hey, Daru.
Okarin!
Okabe!
Damn it!
Hey, Daru, Mayuri,
is anyone here?
Wait a minute.
What?
Come in.
Eroge again?
No, I mean, yes.
I just finished.
Please don't continue.
It smells like smoke.
Well,
I decided to open the band,
and the microwave blew up.
It blew up?
We'll be evicted if you're not careful.
Anyway,
why did you come?
Mayusha is not here now.
Kiryu got information
that Kagari may be in this area.
Did you see her?
No, I didn't see.
Have you finished with the computer?
Wait a minute.
Done.
Stop with these illegal things.
I have good news for you.
Go to hell!
I haven't said anything yet.
Yesterday I had lunch with Professor Leskin.
He said...
Is it about the trip abroad?
Listen to the end.
He said that you
interested him and other professors.
At the University of Victoria-Hondria
there is a faculty of computer science,
and they want you to go.
Me?
With your skills, it will be easy.
I'm a superhacker, damn it.
Of course I can do it.
Don't you want to?
It's not that I don't want to.
Given the situation,
I don't want to think about it.
Susie wants to go back to the past
and everything else...
What?
Is there anything interesting there?
No,
but there are a lot of rumors
about the Tyba object.
Where did we go with Kiryu?
The occultists are sure.
These guys make a living, I swear.
Don't believe a single word they say.
The name of the answerer?
It's coming.
Is it a bunch of bananas?
No,
Susie just put me
on a banana diet.
Well, if that's the case...
Karin, wait!
Please, don't!
Nostalgia.
Mayuri was so angry
and said that you can't
waste food in vain.
Exactly.
What is this?
What is this?
The secret didn't last long.
And we've been trying
to keep it a secret for so long.
What's going on?
What's going on?
What's going on?
What's going on?
What's going on?
What's going on?
What's going on?
What's going on?
This is a telekinesis.
Version two.
Did you really restore it?
I wasn't sure about
version two.
Who do you think I did this to?
Isn't it?
It's not like you, Karin.
You were really worried about
the name of the gadget in the future.
This is dangerous! This thing shouldn't exist!
Wait, but we made the time machine in the future, didn't we?
That's why I see it as the first step in the work on research.
Daru! I explained it to you again and again.
You have to know what can happen.
You have to know through what I had to go through.
Because of her, Mayuri is killed.
Because of her, Kurisu sacrificed herself.
Because of her, your daughter committed suicide.
It's all because of her!
Oh, Karin!
If you still don't understand, I'll repeat.
Are you really an idiot?
You won't understand anything if you don't go through it yourself!
Idiot!
You're the only idiot here!
Okaburintaro!
Hey, Adjo.
Why are you here?
What?
It's impulsive.
Impulsive?
Legal Lola won!
I'll go to court!
I'm sorry for making you wait.
So you've been hiding all this time?
Yes.
That's why you came to Japan.
That's right.
In fact, I was going to work on the so-called TV.
That's not right.
It wasn't Hashida who invited me.
Maho.
Although it's true that he contacted me first.
But he did it for Suzuhiro.
For Suzuhiro?
You should know, Karin.
The fuel in the time machine will be enough to return only a year ago.
Not long before the death of Makise Kurisu,
after that, go back and change the world branch.
Therefore, if we fail and try again,
we will need another time machine.
So you pulled in Hiyaji?
At first, I hoped that I could finish everything myself,
but I ended up in a dead end.
And you?
Did you really agree to help?
Yes, that's right.
But why?
I explained everything to you.
You must know what the D-Mails did.
You must understand what changing the past means.
And you intend to repeat it?
Don't you understand?
If you change the past, it means that you deprive someone of life.
As a result, Mayuri will die.
Wait, that's not what I...
Saving Kurisu means Mayuri's death.
It's inevitable.
It doesn't matter what you do and how hard you try.
You're trying to finish the machine,
which means you want to change the past.
You'll cancel Kurisu's sacrifice for the sake of this world
and return to the world alpha line.
And then you'll kill Mayuri.
You want to become a killer?
Akarin!
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry to Maha right now!
What?
Hoshido!
I understand what you're talking about, Akarin.
I can't even imagine what kind of suffering you had to go through.
But still!
It doesn't give you the right to underestimate the feelings of others!
Hoshido, that's enough!
Suzuka!
You came here to stop the Third World War!
Maha was so worried about Makisa
that she agreed to work on our time machine!
Nobody does it for fun!
Mayuri is no exception!
You can't imagine what she went through for you!
That's enough!
You need to wash up.
Come on!
He hit me.
It's because of the stupidity you talked about.
It's my fault.
I didn't want this.
I know.
Now I have a better opinion of you.
You got mad at someone else.
He's usually so quiet.
It hurts even more.
Just so you know,
we were just going to create a time machine
and didn't think about sending emails.
I see.
You look disappointed.
I think the rain has stopped.
It's good to get some fresh air.
What's going on?
Nothing.
It just seems to me
that this world exists because of Kurisu's choice.
This decision has allowed Mayuri to live.
I have to defend this choice.
That's the law of this world.
The law of this world?
At that time, I found out one thing.
Some events are repeated,
as if they were organized by God himself.
And the attempt to change them
throws a challenge to God.
God cannot stand human arrogance.
Perhaps.
Although I am a scientist,
I am not going to provoke God.
Then?
However,
I think you are wrong about God and the laws of this world.
Hiyaji.
If there really are laws that define our world,
if our fate is decided by some god,
there is no point in living,
there is no point in trying,
and there is no point in choosing.
I'm not saying that everything is determined,
only some things.
Then tell me.
Tell me that you can't change the laws of this world,
and that you can.
This...
Any scientist will ask this question.
As it seems to me,
the laws of this world are formulas.
A formula that makes this world possible.
It doesn't mean that we can't solve it.
People have a will.
They use their minds,
make decisions and act.
It makes the world the way it is.
It must be difficult.
But if we work hard on the solution,
we can solve it.
But...
Back in time?
Prata Steiner.
I was thinking about what Suzuka told me.
My Shina is alive,
Makise Kurisu is alive,
and the Third World War was avoided.
If you call this the Steiner's Gate,
then for me this is a formula.
But it all means that we can find a common solution.
And I am Arjo.
This world is full of endless possibilities.
And among them, something will be found.
So look!
Look, look again!
One thousand, ten thousand, one million times!
Find a solution for Prata Steiner,
like you used to with Kurisu!
I can't!
Okabe!
It's easy for you to say that,
but it only breaks my heart.
You don't know how to endure failure again and again!
I know!
It's not true!
I know!
Many times next to Kurisu,
thousands and tens of thousands of times!
It's not that there is no formula for research!
But they were all solved by people!
And you know that!
Okarin!
I'm sorry.
Okarin...
hopeless?
No.
There is still a chance.
Really?
I lost to Kurisu in our experiments,
I lost in theory,
I lost in fame.
But I look in the mirror and keep moving.
After all, if I give up, everything will end.
And then I will never be able to win.
Now Okabe has the same face as I used to.
Mayuri?
Okarin, where are you from?
Well, I just passed by.
And you?
Yes, me too.
We used to sit here all the time.
Yes.
It was before I met Daru.
After school, I went to the laboratory
and waited for you there alone.
Maybe I was alone, but I wasn't lonely.
It was happiness.
But now in the laboratory I'm a little lonely.
Nothing has changed, right?
I'm Daru.
Interesting, is that true?
It seems to me that in the laboratory
there used to be more people,
more life and happiness.
No, that's not true.
But...
Hey, Okarin.
I wonder, Mayuri was mistaken.
Maybe I should have left you?
Mayuri?
Okarin, maybe you should have saved Makis?
But in the end, I didn't.
But instead, you sacrificed yourself to save me.
Because of me, you stopped going to the laboratory.
And you always look like you're suffering.
You're wrong.
But...
Did you hear our conversation in the laboratory?
But...
Don't think about it.
Don't think about it anymore, Mayuri.
Just forget about it.
But...
But...
Everything is fine, do you understand?
Now...
Now everything is fine.
I don't want to destroy everything this time.
Then why?
What?
Why?
Why does it hurt so much in your eyes?
Since that very day, you've been suffering so much.
Did you hear about Rehime?
It's Vega's star.
But you know,
I'm called differently abroad.
It's Arclight.
Mayuri...
Altair, Endless Points.
Vega and Altair.
