        <pre>Oh, my God, so much has happened after the New Year's Eve event with the ravens.
This is a MAHO robbery!
And what do you have?
Do you like it?
This is from a store in Kehobar.
A toy gun for the festival.
You can shoot beans out of it.
Evil spirit, go away.
Money, come to the house.
Right?
Good luck, come to the house, Professor.
Besides, shouldn't we get ready to go home?
Stop buying useless things, please.
Reyes will probably get angry.
I guess, since we borrowed this office, we should return it in the best shape.
But we still have time to get together.
And while we're here, we should respect the festivals of Japan.
Study the traditions!
Do you know the Japanese saying?
Without a cat, mice are a mess.
Setsubun, right?
February has already come.
Valentine's Day?
See you, boss.
We're going.
It was nice to work with you.
And me.
Wait.
Your salary for the past month.
But I...
You protected me, so...
This is a completely different thing.
Well, just take it.
I'm sure there's not so much there.
That's how it is.
I'm sure there's not so much there.
That's how it is.
That's how it is.
And it seems you don't mind working for free.
No.
Thank you very much.
God.
Here.
Salary.
Thank you very much.
You seem happy.
I got my first salary in my life.
Have you already decided what you're going to spend on?
I haven't figured it out yet.
There are delicious cakes in this bakery.
No, I just...
What's wrong, Kagari?
Well, what is it?
Valentine's Day?
Yes.
The day when people share their feelings
and give chocolate to their loved ones.
To those they love.
When I was little,
Mom always tried to give us chocolate.
That's wonderful.
To put your feelings into a gift for a dear person.
It's such a beautiful tradition.
Kagari!
Maybe Kagari has a lover?
What?
What?
You're going to give him a gift, aren't you?
Can you calm down?
I already said no.
But why?
You're leaving soon.
That's why you need to tell me about your feelings.
I already told you.
I don't care about Kaba.
Keep hiding and you'll regret it.
It's better to tell and regret it
than to do nothing at all.
Senpai?
Senpai?
Senpai?
There's no one at all?
I already told you.
Besides, we're in America.
Guys give Valentine's Day to those they like.
But if a girl wants to share her feelings,
don't you think it's romantic?
Romance is stupid for a scientist.
To be a scientist means to be a real romantic.
Don't you know?
And who said that?
Me.
Then what about you?
A brilliant girl whose theories are published in the magazine.
But hundreds of guys have put their eyes on you.
In America, some people want to meet me.
But they all run away in a few minutes.
They retreat immediately after losing the bet.
Besides,
I already have someone in mind.
You're lying!
In any case, it's better to risk and regret it
than to regret that you didn't do anything.
What were you thinking about?
Nothing interesting.
Our conversation is over anyway.
What?
Yes, yes, I'm turning off the power.
Did I eavesdrop on your conversation?
What?
I think Maha still has someone special.
What?
Put your feelings into the prepared chocolate.
And then give it to him.
Wait, what did you hear?
I didn't say anything like that.
But I have the eyes of the god of heaven.
And I see you through.
No, I already said chocolate.
What?
What?
Good morning.
Kiryu!
How long have you been here?
All the time.
So the whole conversation...
I'll give you chocolate.
What?
I'll give you chocolate too.
What?
This means that you...
There is a person who she wants to give chocolate to.
I'm surprised.
I didn't think Kiryu had feelings for someone.
Who is it?
It's a secret.
What?
It seems so, yes.
No, no, it's not right.
What? Why?
Kagari has a lover.
I'm back.
Welcome back, dad.
Oh, Nae.
Are you doing well?
Yes.
I played with Kagari's sister.
That's great.
Hey, you know what my sister did?
Don't, Nae.
She's so clumsy.
God, why did you have to say that?
Just.
Don't worry.
I already knew it.
And you even...
Impossible.
Boss, I think I love you.
It's impossible.
Yes, I'm a man, but first of all, I'm a father.
Then...
I...
Then I'll be Nae's mother.
What?
No, it's impossible.
What happened?
What? No, nothing.
What?
I'm talking to myself.
I'd better go and clean up the street.
Good afternoon.
Yes?
Oh, it's you, Akabe.
How are you?
Did you find out anything about the attacker?
No, I didn't come for this.
Akarin,
why did you look around today?
To find out how things are going.
You wanted to visit me?
Yes.
You look good.
Thank you for looking at us.
You must be cold.
No, I'm fine.
Besides, I have a message for you from Mayuri.
She offers to pick up your phone together.
Mayuri offered?
What are they talking about?
No!
It's so cold here.
I'm fine.
You say so, but you have red cheeks.
Do you see?
Cheeks?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Akari, everything is fine.
Everything is fine, Akari.
Impossible.
Just not this.
If everything is like this, then my sister will hate me.
What should I do?
Thank you all for your help.
You're welcome.
Mayusha and Ferris are friends.
And Mayusha's friends are our friends.
Nice to hear.
Besides, sewing costumes is fun.
By the way, will you cook something for Mayusha?
Yes.
Customers will like it even more.
God, I'm not in your shape in the cafe.
Chocolate.
You will make a gift for Karina.
Yes.
But I'm not very good at cooking.
Yes?
Then how do you like it?
Don't you want to eat my ears?
How do you like it?
Fubuki, you are now reminding me of Daru.
It's not like that.
If you cook something with love,
then I'm sure that Karina will be happy.
Well, I don't know.
Ferris?
Lie down on Ferris.
Episode 24
Polymorphine Valentine
Bitter Sweet Intermediate
I declare the 36th round table on chocolate open.
Round table?
Chocolate meeting?
Simply put, we will cook chocolate.
Unbelievable!
You've already done it 36 times.
I know you invited me,
but why am I here?
I have an interesting feeling about Karina, but it's funny.
I'm leaving.
Are you sure?
If you leave, you won't get delicious chocolate.
It doesn't matter to me.
Yuki will come too.
Since you insist,
besides, chocolate is a good source of energy.
Then it's decided.
Let's start cooking chocolate.
Yes.
Hey, who are you going to give chocolate to?
Dad.
Exactly.
And you won't even treat some boy at school?
Of course not.
What about you?
Me?
But...
It's a secret.
Damn it.
Hey, it's not fair.
Tell me.
Everything is going well.
If we give delicious chocolate to the cafe,
it will be the best advertisement.
What are you doing?
Hush!
Or I'll be fooled.
It didn't work again.
You don't have to be so precise.
Baking is a chemical reaction,
and this is an accurate science.
It smells like smoke.
I wonder why it happened.
Stop thinking about it.
It's hot.
What now?
The microwave is broken.
I can't put foil in it.
What?
Stop it!
Stop it!
Follow the recipe.
It's strange.
There are so many of us here
that someone must know
how to cook properly.
Excuse me for being late.
You're late.
M-Messiah!
Yukina!
Rukina!
Ferris!
Here.
I don't know if it worked,
but it's yours.
Don't worry about it.
I guarantee it's delicious.
Hey, Daru.
I don't like to distract you,
but...
Couldn't you stop
talking to the characters?
Sorry.
Take it easy.
If it were so,
it would always be so.
Wow!
I see.
It melts because of the hot water.
Everything will burn if you heat it directly.
I know!
It's okay.
Yes.
You did a good job.
Thank you.
It looks like
everything is fine.
But I'm so tired.
I want to sleep so much.
Ouch!
I'm sorry, Ruka.
It's okay.
Oh, no.
You need to wash your clothes
or the stain will get on your clothes.
No, it's okay.
It's not true.
You need to wash the oil quickly.
But I don't have a change of clothes.
What?
What?
Unbelievable.
Why did I
wear this?
Is it just a replacement
for your clothes?
Even girls like that
are attracted to it.
My sister did it
with my brother.
What?
Quickly!
Give me another dress!
Great!
Hooray!
Everything is ready!
I think we did a good job, right?
Yes.
Hey!
Will it last until Valentine's Day?
It's chocolate.
It's well stored in the refrigerator.
I'll write down the recipe
for those who want to cook it themselves.
So don't be shy.
How is it?
It's delicious.
What?
What happened, Fairies?
I got burned
and sat down.
It's not the time yet,
sister.
The meeting of the round table is not over
until the kitchen remains dirty.
Listen, I will work with you
until there is no perfect cleanliness here.
Are you ready?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Stop stuffing your mouth with chocolate.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Seriously?
Kagari likes Akarin?
Maybe.
It can turn into a disaster.
Kagari is my daughter.
I envy
both mother and daughter.
Yes.
No kidding.
Kagari from the future
with someone from the past.
There is a great risk
of a paradox.
It can be dangerous.
I'm so happy.
What?
To cook and have fun with everyone.
I don't remember my past,
but I've never been so happy.
I think so.
Kagari.
I hope
they will like my chocolate.
We have prepared
special costumes for you, gentlemen.
A gift for Valentine's Day.
We have a special service today.
This is handmade chocolate
prepared by our maidens.
This is for me.
Here.
Thank you.
I'm so touched.
Everyone liked it.
It's a pity that it's only today.
I will never go on this
next year.
Well.
Interesting.
Everyone gave out their chocolates.
Thank you for everything.
Did you leave it to Kagari?
Did you leave it to Kagari?
Yes.
And not only for you.
There is something for me, my father,
and even for Mr. Brown.
If I remember correctly,
she was looking forward to this day.
I think
she will come back to us.
I hope
they will like my chocolate.
Thank you.
It's very tasty.
Stupid.
Thank you.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.

What?
Going back to America without a gift of chocolate?
Unbelievable.
Of course, you should go back earlier.
You can leave on e-mail
or give someone in advance.
I've given her a gift.
What?
That's right.
W-wait.
So, was he happy about that?
I don't know.
I think so.
I was a little late with that.
Late?
W-wait, Senpai!
For me?
In Japan, people give chocolate to their important friends.
But I didn't cook anything.
It's okay.
There's always a next year.
Thank you.
