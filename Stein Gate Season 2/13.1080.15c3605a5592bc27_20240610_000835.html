        <pre>It's great that Kagari finally got his memories back.
Yeah, I guess so.
Mom!
So you're my daughter?
I'm your daughter, right?
So, daughter, what's up, mom?
Do you want to eat a banana together?
Banana? Do you want me to feed you?
What? It's okay. I can do it myself.
When I fed you before, you were very happy.
Then can you help me?
Yes. Tell me.
What about Karina?
What do you think?
Could it be the beginning of a good Yury?
What a difficult question.
May I ask you something?
How is my Yury?
Maybe I'm his mom?
Mom, I love you!
I love you too!
I love you too!
The End
Wow! Is this for me?
I'm happy! Thank you, mom!
You're welcome!
I'm surprised how well Mayusha understood the situation.
I think she hasn't figured it out yet.
She just accepted it.
Is she Mayusha's child?
That's right.
What? It's impossible! Mayusha has never given birth!
It's not that simple.
She moved with Suzuka from the future.
From the future?
Mom gave birth to me because I didn't have any relatives left.
I did it, but Mayusha doesn't remember it.
Of course you don't remember.
It happened to you in the distant future.
Mom!
Don't be skeptical. I would be worried about her mind.
That's right.
Akarin, look at this. It's so cool!
Ta-da!
Mom gave it to me.
They look alike. Great, right?
Yes, that's right.
You know what, Kogane? You've changed a little.
Because her memories about the future have changed.
Now you're so cheerful and lively.
Really?
I think it's her real character.
Mayusha thinks Kagari is my daughter.
Really? I'm so happy.
Where's Suzuka's sister?
That's right.
She left recently.
It can't be!
I have to go to work.
It's time to go, Mom.
Bye.
See you later.
I think her childhood memories have finally returned.
She was about six when Mayusha gave her a daughter.
Approximately.
And then in 2036, she left her past with Suzuka when she was ten.
Suzuka used IBM 5100 to solve the problem of the year 2000.
And so she was in 1975, before she left in 1998.
But there they separated from Kagari.
And the last thing I'll remind you of is 12 years later, in 2010,
after she was found unconscious at the border of the Tiba prefecture.
And recently, probably because of the accident,
her childhood memories have returned.
But from 10 to 22 there is a 12-year gap.
Yes.
Even in such a peaceful place as Japan,
a ten-year-old girl will not survive alone.
The only possibility is that someone took care of her somewhere.
Nevertheless, we lack information.
Kiryu is still investigating this case.
But she hasn't found anything yet.
So we won't be able to do anything until she remembers herself.
If only we had a hint or something like that.
Excuse me for being late.
What?
Boss.
He's out.
I see.
So I could spend more time with Mom.
Just a joke. I would never miss work.
Oh, yeah.
Sister Suzuka.
Mom gave me a very cute phone case.
I see. I'm glad for you.
And she said we should go somewhere to have fun.
Why don't you come with us, Sister Su...
I don't want to.
Why?
I don't have time for that.
Maybe you hate me?
Why do you think so?
You have an unpleasant expression on your face all our conversation.
I was born with such a face.
Moreover, I have a task.
But you looked very happy when you ate curry.
It's impossible to fight an empty stomach.
Yes.
And what does it mean?
I was born with such a face.
I don't care that you're playing with your mom.
Don't drag me into it.
It's great to be with you.
You had time all over the world to play with your parents.
What?
It's true.
After all, you've been living with Uncle Daru and Aunt Yuki for six months.
But if it's about me, you can't just spend time with Mom.
You!
Can you imagine how hard it was for me?
I spent so much precious fuel on your search.
I'm sorry.
You never tried to contact me.
And when you finally showed up, you forgot everything so conveniently.
It's not like that.
I didn't want to forget it.
Besides, if it's my fault, it's because you left me.
If you hadn't run away that day, I wouldn't have been left alone in this world.
Wait, Kagari.
What are you talking about?
You heard me.
When we were walking that day, you left me.
After that, I was so helpless.
What the hell are you standing here for?
If you're free, clean up something.
Go ahead and relax, and I won't pay you.
Kagari has strange memories.
That's exactly what Suzuka told me.
It seems that Kagari's memories are somewhat different from what Suzuka remembers.
Besides, she was just a child back then, so her memories can't be exact.
That's true, but...
What?
Kagari?
Oh, Mom.
What happened?
Everyone looks so worried since my memory came back.
I think it might be better if I don't remember anything.
The cause of memory loss?
Yes.
Moreover, only a part of them came back.
Don't you think it's strange?
Yes, it might be too beneficial.
But I'm not an expert in this.
It's all right.
Please, tell me everything you can.
I'm not an expert in this.
Please, tell me everything you can.
It's all right.
Please, tell me everything you can.
Let's list the normal causes.
It could be an accident, illness, stress, or emotional shock.
That's all in a nutshell.
But if nothing else, could the third party interfere and do it artificially?
Have you ever thought about it?
Well?
I don't know.
But it could be...
It could be.
In that case, only one thing comes to mind.
And that is?
Brainwashing.
Consciousness control.
Episode 13.
Motherfucker of diffraction recitatives.
Mozart for all ages.
It's already all over.
Do you know anything?
You're still living here?
What's this?
Find it.
It's a 5-kilometer radius to Kazan district.
Is there really something there?
We won't know until we check it ourselves.
What do you think?
Well, it doesn't look like you.
Yes, I think I said a little too much.
Maybe it's because I'm jealous.
Gagari?
Yes.
If I could forget about the mission, live freely,
spoiled by everyone.
If you want to be spoiled, then I'll take care of it, baby.
Fool!
However,
if you regret it, you can just apologize.
I'm not very good at it,
but it's temporary.
If only I had the opportunity.
And so I'm going to have a party.
A party?
Yes, to celebrate the return of my daughter's memory.
Your daughter?
Yes, but I don't even know.
What do you think, will Gagari like it?
Good idea.
If you do it, I'm sure she'll like it.
Really?
Then I'll tell everyone and start preparing.
My Yosha will be very busy.
Ready for the investigation.
You can leave tomorrow morning.
A long trip is painful.
Mozart for all ages.
Tomorrow evening?
Since today is Sunday, can you come to the laboratory at five?
Yes, of course I can.
But if you're there,
I can ask the boss to let me go earlier.
You shouldn't come so early.
What? But why?
Well, it's a secret.
Understood.
Party.
What?
Why?
Because when you're hiding,
it's always a party.
Well, am I right?
Well, it's just...
In any case, you can't come earlier than five o'clock.
Okay.
Oh, yes.
Don't you mind if I invite Suzuko?
Why are you asking?
Because you and Suzuko haven't talked much lately.
I don't know what happened between you,
but you and Suzuko are very important people to me.
So I want you to get along.
Mom...
It's okay.
Suzuko's sister went through a lot too.
Tomorrow, when I see her, I'll apologize.
And I hope we can discuss it.
It seems that someone has gone crazy again.
I've already taken care of the food and drinks.
They'll deliver everything right before I start.
And we have enough dishes.
Hi.
Suzuko, thank you for coming.
Yes, thank you for the invitation.
By the way, where are the others?
Daru went shopping with Yuki and the guys.
And Karin left early in the morning.
But he said he'd come back for the party.
So this is brainwashing.
Brainwashing?
I don't know the exact way they use it to control their minds.
But they say that memories can be suppressed by using drugs.
I want to say that everything is possible.
If there are people who have done something like that with Kagari...
Hello.
Come in.
Have you finished already?
God, no more shopping, please.
Yoho, we're here.
Hi.
Thank you for coming.
Ma'am Noya, welcome to Ma'am Noya.
Hello, smiling bear.
Bear?
Hey, maybe we should slow down.
It's a short day in the mountains.
If we don't hurry, it'll get dark.
And it's dangerous in the dark.
Please, be careful.
It'll be safer if we get to the dark.
No!
Goodbye.
What?
Is there something there for sure?
What?
The building seems to have been used recently.
What?
It should take many years to...
Mask.
What?
The garbage is scattered here to create such an image.
But the shards are relatively new.
Six months.
The biggest one.
Six months.
Six months.
Six months.
Six months.
Six months.
Six months.
Six months.
Six months.
Six months.
Six months.
Six months.
The biggest is a year.
Do you want to watch here?
Come on.
Thank you very much.
It's a little early, but it's not a big deal.
I wonder if Suzuha's sister will like it or not.
Episode One
So, what do you say, Doctor?
Kagari, do you still need treatment?
It may seem healthy, but...
For treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder caused by the war,
you need much more time.
But I hate this treatment.
My head hurts because of it.
Can you be patient a little?
And mom will come later, okay?
Uh-huh.
Okay.
Come on, Kagari.
We'll do everything we can today.
I...
hear...
my voice...
It's my voice...
It's my voice...
It's my voice...
Kagari is late.
She promised to come here right away.
What if something happened?
I'll try to call again.
Come on.
I'll look for her.
Suzuha!
Okabe!
What was that?
What was that sound?
I found the switch,
pressed it, and here it is.
A secret passage?
Okabe!
Okabe...
is here.
It's...
Kagari...
was...
here.
But...
who could...
and for what purpose?
Hello?
Thank God you answered, Okabe.
What happened, Mayuri?
Listen, Kagari...
Kagari...
She's gone?
