G-Gagari! Wait!
Gagari.
Where is it?
A precious gift from Mom.
A precious gift?
Yes.
Rumi's sister?
Yes.
Rumi's sister?
Well, how are you?
Well, I have about a week left.
I feel sorry for the others.
Suzunya, what are you talking about?
Oh, this is my real treasure.
Oh, is that you?
So, next to you...
Yes, this is a photo of my mother.
Why do you have such an unhappy face here?
To be honest, I don't remember myself.
Yes, I don't remember.
Now I've already forgotten everything.
Suzunya.
What?
Oh, we haven't seen each other for a long time.
My brother?
I think he's all right.
Oh, I'm glad to hear that.
He hasn't been seen lately.
So I thought maybe he was sick.
Well, if everything is fine, then okay.
The End
The End
The End
I can't wait to meet Maho.
Be careful.
Don't forget that she...
Hey, Adjo!
We haven't seen each other for a long time, guys.
I think Maho is all right.
Yes.
Apparently she came to help the professor.
Such a busy girl.
I wonder, is Kagari all right too?
Me too.
I know that Dara and Suzunya were looking for her.
Uh-huh.
By the way, where's Hajime?
I think he needed to discuss something important with Suzunya, so he didn't come.
What the hell, dad?
I don't understand.
Why are you so angry?
Put your hand on your heart and think.
Hand on my heart?
If you keep behaving like that,
Mom will start dating someone else.
What? Repeat.
What are you talking about?
I saw.
I saw how cute Mom was talking to other guys.
Hamans?
When was the last time you met?
Well, when I decided to visit Fubuki.
So long ago?
Uh-huh.
Why didn't you meet her more often?
Well, just because I was so busy with the time machine and other things.
You would have found time if you wanted to.
I'm sorry.
What if everything continues like this and Mom goes after someone else?
Maybe there's nothing wrong with that.
Maybe it was some guy who was asking for the road or trying to sell something to her.
What if it's not true?
If you're so worried, why don't you ask her?
Why doesn't it bother you?
At this pace, I may not exist in the future at all.
But doesn't the fact that you're here right now mean that you're definitely going to be born?
What?
Is that Aman from the future?
Oh! Loli Suzuka is so cute!
It doesn't matter. Look more carefully.
What? Why are you so sad?
I always looked like that back then.
It's like...
Dad!
What?
You don't have confidence, Dad.
You don't have enough confidence.
And so instead of taking the first step, you sit and wait until she does it.
Right?
Well, that's...
For those who don't do anything, there's no future.
What?
You told me that a long time ago, Dad.
I said that?
But that's...
Listen to me.
If you don't get along with Mom, I'll have problems.
I'm serious.
Hello!
We're here.
What?
Ruko and Mayuko are here too?
What happened to you?
Sister Mayuko.
We need your help.
What?
So you want to teach Daru to be more confident in himself before tomorrow's meeting?
I'm not very good at this, so I need help from all of you.
Did you use Photon?
Brother!
Yes?
Announce the beginning of our mission.
The goal of tomorrow is to finish the meeting.
Hoshida and Daru must talk to Yukiamana and confess their feelings.
Confess?
That's crazy.
I don't want to hear that.
One more time.
Misuzuka!
Yes!
Misuzuka!
The poor thing wanted to see you so much that she begged me to let her come to Japan.
I didn't say that.
By the way, Rintaro, how is your report going?
The one we were talking about the other day?
Well, it's with me.
Really?
You're impressive.
Suzuka?
It's nothing special.
Rintaro, modesty in practice is not always a good deed.
Especially if you hope to get into America.
I'm sorry.
Just...
Thank you.
I'll have to give out an evening to read your report.
If there's something worthy, you'll be able to transfer even earlier.
Okay.
I'm sure Maha will like it too.
Professor!
What happened?
Karin?
What happened?
Karin?
We were just going to the lab and I wanted to know if you wanted to join us.
The lab?
Yes.
Will you come?
Sorry.
Maybe next time.
I see.
Well, it's okay.
Try your best, Karin.
If you want to be popular, you have to know places with good cuisine.
So now I'll teach you a good manner and tell you about the restaurant.
Miss Ferris!
Yes, Miss Ferris!
Yuki is a good cosplayer, right?
So if you wear something unusual, it can make her heart beat.
Miss Mayuri!
Yes, Miss Mayuri!
Really?
The most important thing is to understand what's going on in a woman's heart.
How are you, brother?
Do you feel confident?
What?
Yes.
I can't believe I came for this.
You're kidding, right?
Maha!
Where's Karin?
He stayed with the professor.
Will you help us?
I'll be sad too if Hashida stays like this.
So tell me the details.
In general, in other words, he needs more confidence when communicating with a woman.
What is it?
Let's say, at this stage, the system has two or several improvements.
But in general, something like a dream training system.
Hashida and Taro, do you believe or not?
You're a womanizer.
Even Don Joon cannot compare to your charm and success.
I'm a successful man.
Now open your eyes.
Yuki!
Yuki!
Hashida?
As usual.
Okay, I understand.
Do you often come here?
I'm just a successful man.
Right.
Did everything go well?
Great!
I don't know.
Do you think this is a good idea?
This is how it should be.
I know.
The idea of a womanizer will definitely come true.
I never thought it would work.
Wow!
So beautiful!
Yes, but you are even more beautiful.
Thank you very much.
It's so romantic.
Brother, there is only one step left.
Look at me!
Today was...
Yuki!
What?
Hashida...
I want to say something, Yuki.
Yuki, can you?
Can you?
Episode 15
Recognition of the asymptomatic line
Recognize the asymptomatic
I failed.
Dad, don't despair.
You haven't been rejected, have you?
It doesn't matter how you see it.
She hates me.
Can you?
Oh no, look at the time.
What?
I have to go.
I have to go.
What?
I had a great time.
Thank you.
It's useless.
Deep down, she doesn't want to have a guy like me.
But I was so self-confident.
I misunderstood the situation and suddenly took her by the hand.
Right.
Just look at me.
My hands are sweaty, sticky and disgusting.
I'm sure she thought so.
Ugh, it's disgusting.
Let go of my hand, slippery pervert.
No.
Mom is not that kind of person.
I knew it was too good to be true.
Think about it.
Why would such a pretty girl ever decide to marry a guy like me?
The common sense says it's just impossible.
Amane will marry someone else.
Don't say that, Dad.
But you said it yourself that it would happen.
Dad.
I'm sorry.
I have to be alone.
Sousou, I'm sorry.
My little sister.
I'm sorry.
No.
It happened because I suggested a photo idea.
I tried too.
No.
It's not your fault.
It's my fault.
Right.
Just like back then.
Mom!
Mom!
Sousou.
Be careful.
Mom.
Dad.
Can we talk?
Yes.
The future I came from wasn't a peaceful place.
I've never spent a lot of time alone.
I've never spent a lot of time with you or Mom.
There was no possibility.
That's why...
To tell you the truth, I just wanted to see it.
Mom and Dad, who gave birth to me, live together.
That's how I understand that I'm going the right way.
I thought I needed proof.
I'm sorry.
Her conversations with other guys and my disappearance were a lie.
I lied to you.
Well, I assumed it was true.
Yes, I knew.
Dad.
It doesn't matter if I lied or told the truth.
I just wanted someone to make me move.
I behaved selfishly.
I'm the only one who needs to apologize.
Dad.
Amano, I'm sorry for today.
Yes, that's why...
Tomorrow.
Do you want to meet tomorrow?
Yes.
Yes.
Bye.
Dad.
I'm not your rival.
Damn it.
Why should I do everything on my own?
Amano!
We had a good time today.
Thank you.
You too.
Thank you for spending these two days with me.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Amano?
I think you're wonderful when you're real.
Well...
I'm sorry.
Dad.
I...
I think I don't feel you!
My my Kyon!
Dad.
Thank God.
Now I can...
Let's meet today.
I'm very worried about Amano.
I'm worried about him.
I'm worried about him.
I'm worried about him.
I'm worried about him.
Dad, dad, today...
I want to talk about a lot.
Rentaro!
I'm sorry I kept you.
It's okay.
You've got it.
I'm sorry, when you work in the hospital,
problems arise one after another.
I've read your report.
Some elements are needed in the initial draft,
but you have an interesting point of view.
Do you have time to discuss it with me?
Sure.
Your brother is very worried about you, isn't he?
Yes, I couldn't wish for a better family.
So, my brother, please take care of him.
I'll try.
I feel the same way, my Maekyun.
I feel the same way, my Maekyun, Kitaro.
Suzuka, I'm so glad I gave birth to you.
Thank you.
What?
How strange.
I...
Why?
It's okay. You don't need to explain.
Don't you want to come in?
It's okay. We'll still have time to take a lot of photos.
Take it.
Are you sure?
If I stay a little longer with you,
I'll feel like a third person.
I'll feel like a third person.
I'll feel like a third person.
I'll feel like a third person.
If I stay a little longer with you,
I'll feel like a third person.
Shall we go?
Yes.
Thank you, Mom.
