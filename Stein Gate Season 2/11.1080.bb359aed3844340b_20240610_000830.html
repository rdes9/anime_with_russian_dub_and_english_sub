        <pre>Are you sure it's here?
No doubt about it.
But it's the first time I've been here myself.
It says it sees us.
We need to turn right from the gorge.
It's like a secret passage.
It's like a secret passage.
It's here.
Keep an eye on the frequency.
Daru, what are you doing here?
That was supposed to be my replica.
So you were the one who analyzed it.
It turns out that old lady Maha made an order.
I didn't even see that coming.
Couldn't you not call me that?
It's insulting me.
Why?
It's Milla.
I put so much effort to keep this secret.
I didn't suspect you were doing something like that.
Is that him?
I was surprised when I turned it on and saw his name.
So this is Makis' computer.

Anilibria.TV presents...
Vratashteyna 0
Pandora of forgotten existence.
The sealed reliquary.
So, you've been talking all this time and didn't know who is who?
I heard about the computer guru that you can trust and that he works abroad.
But nobody knows him in person.
What did you expect?
When I checked the computer, I assumed that it could be you.
But still, good luck.
It's okay. If you give me three more days...
Cancel it right now.
What?
What are you talking about?
There could be something terrible inside this computer.
Something that could harm our whole world.
It's bullshit.
Stop it!
I'm not kidding. It's serious.
It's about Suzuhi too.
Suzuhi?
Yes. You should know if the time machine...
Never mind.
Something you can't talk about with me, right?
Sorry.
I understand.
I think I'd better go.
Take me later.
Akarin, maybe it's better to tell her?
But...
You don't want to tell her about the bad?
No.
But if I tell her, she can...
The time machine...
They need any part of her research.
Maybe this theory could be inside Amadeus.
I'm just...
a chicken.
Are you done?
No.
I'll tell you what happened and what could happen.
Are you sure?
Yes.
Otherwise, it's unfair to you.
But promise me one thing.
Don't ask to save Makisakurisu.
Don't even think about it.
Akarin said there were urgent matters and he won't come.
I see.
We've already talked about food and if he had time, but...
Kagari, do you like this ad?
Yes.
It's clean.
Now 50% less sugar.
It's already on sale.
Impossible!
You don't believe in it?
I can't say I don't believe, but it's hard to perceive.
The theory is one thing, but you made a real time machine.
Just to create it is not all.
We created a TV wave that could send a message directly to the past and a time machine.
They look alike.
No matter how, but we could successfully manipulate the past.
Time machine.
If Suzuka is here, then the machine must be somewhere.
And what's next?
What?
It's...
That's why you said not to think about saving Ikurisu.
Yes.
The past can't be.
No.
Or rather, you can't manipulate time.
Never.
But if you save Ikurisu, then this situation can...
I said it's not that simple.
If you change the past, then all your assumptions will become useless.
It can take away someone's success or joy.
And someone can disappear from this world forever.
Not from us.
That's why strange and strong organizations do everything to get such power.
It's scarier than any possible weapon.
And that's why we must exclude the possibility of its use.
Even without seeing what's inside?
Only the possibility of the existence of this information can become the cause of the war.
People will die.
But it will be too late.
But...
This is proof that Ikurisu lived.
Her heritage.
Make one wrong step and you will be ashamed of the dead forever.
No! I didn't achieve that!
Yes, I know.
Nevertheless, we can't deny such an opportunity.
What's your decision?
I understand.
We must destroy the computer.
Yaja...
Seriously?
What about my salary?
I've already made an order to the rogue going out this month.
You're disgusting.
Why?
Who dared to interrupt our important conversation?
It's...
What?
They've already tracked us down?
Okidoki.
Leave the ship.
You two, run.
Run?
They're already inside.
Quiet. They can hear us.
This way.
I can't believe it's come this far.
That was my favorite cover.
Where are we?
Behind the last building.
If we go further...
Hiyajo!
Do as I say.
Wait.
You need this.
Come on, let her go.
Let's change the laptop for the girl.
I don't think so.
Let's change the laptop for the girl.
Don't you dare!
You can't give it to her!
Hiyajo.
Don't get cocky.
It's not a bluff.
You'll die if you resist.
But...
This computer is so well protected that hackers from all over the world couldn't break it.
And if you hurt her, you'll never know what's inside.
Why should I believe it?
It's your choice.
Let her go and I'll give it to you.
And as soon as the three of us are safe, I'll tell you the password.
The world order hasn't changed.
In other words, Daru and I won't die here.
Then...
Don't you believe me?
Let me be your hostage.
So let her go.
Bukabe!
Well?
Bukabe!
Let the first one go.
Get down!
Bukabe!
The residents of the nearby houses reported the shooting at the police.
And about the further investigation...
Hiyajo, how are you?
Yeah, but are you sure you don't need to go to the hospital?
They'll ask where the wound came from.
And besides...
Show me your palm.
What?
That's weird.
I can't press it.
It's...
Kurisu.
When did I...?
I'm sorry.
Hiyajo.
I'm sorry.
I couldn't.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I couldn't...
protect him.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Kurisu.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Are you sure you're okay?
Yeah.
The bleeding stopped.
Where's Daru?
He went to another shelter.
He said he had to warn his colleague about work.
Should I help you?
Let's treat the wound if the bleeding stopped.
In a box of medicine and bandages.
I knew it was different.
In this line, Cern and Raunder are not involved in this.
So...
Mr. Brown was talking about America.
Is it Darth or Stratfor?
Then...
Russians are involved here.
What the hell?
I don't think we should hurry.
Kurisu.
I...
can't believe it.
What?
I...
feel bad.
Due to the sudden relaxation of the tense muscles,
I got a cramp.
Mahonya.
How do you like the bath?
Nyah!
What happened to her?
Ferris!
Oh no, Nyah!
It's Mahonya!
She's dying, Nyah!
We have to take you to the hospital!
What are you...
Ferris!
Ah!
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
I know you don't have your Venice there.
But...
forget what you saw.
I'll try.
Now you should just say yes.
Otherwise,
you'll get an electric charge at the hippocampus.
Did she say that too?
Only if she argued with stupid professors.
I've seen this scene before.
They got a cramp.
I think one day she could really do it.
Well, I have to go.
You'd better have a good rest,
so that this doesn't happen again.
Yes.
See you.
Okabe.
Will it be impulsive to ask you to stay?
I'll leave when you fall asleep,
so have a rest.
I'm sorry about that.
It's okay.
After everything that happened,
it will be scary anyway.
I'm sure it will be.
Do you think Salieri was happy when he found out?
Or did he feel sorry?
When Mozart died.
Hiyaji.
You warned me not to embarrass the dead.
After that, I understood something.
Maybe it was all.
After her death,
I got this computer.
I claimed that it was her will.
That she wanted it.
That I got her heritage.
That I had to give it to others.
But...
At that moment,
I realized that I was in despair.
I just wanted to open it.
To prove that I could do it.
To show all my abilities.
Did you get it?
I think so.
As if part of me wanted to break in
and find out all her secrets.
I just wanted to open it.
I just wanted to open it.
I just wanted to open it.
I just wanted to open it.
I just wanted to open it.
Deep in my soul.
I see.
It's true.
Mozart didn't waste time
on communicating with Salieri.
He dedicated himself
to creating great music.
But Hiyaji.
In the end, you agreed
to destroy him.
It's because of you.
And besides,
you were crying because of her.
I could protect you.
I'm sorry.
But it doesn't show
your true feelings.
You think too much about me.
I don't...
Then you wouldn't
hold on so tight
to a piece of her computer.
I think so.
I think you're better off.
I guess I'm in the way of your sleep,
so I'd better go.
Scream if you need anything.
Hey.
After you and Kurisu
created a time machine,
did you go through
the same period again and again?
Yeah.
Then you and Kurisu...
No.
Forget it.
Good night.
Good night.
Maho!
Poor girl!
Professor, put out the fire!
Put out the fire!
Professor!
Put out the fire!
Professor, I'm dying!
Thank you for taking us,
Rintaro and the guys from the lab.
By the way, Rintaro,
aren't you going to visit
our lab?
What?
Professor is seriously going to
transfer you to Victor Kondria University.
Me?
It would be a shame to let
the young Japanese Einstein slip away.
I'm counting on you, Rintaro.
Yeah.
I'll do my best and try to come.
Do you agree?
Yeah.
If Akarin wants it,
I'll support him.
Yuki, what's wrong with your hand?
You cut yourself with a knife.
If you want,
I can help.
Thank you very much.
How is Suzuhama?
Well,
she didn't really like it.
Kurisu's computer is gone.
So we managed to avoid
a collision between America and Russia.
Maybe.
But that doesn't mean
the Third World War can be avoided.
Is everything okay?
I did everything I could.
You don't have to worry.
Is it possible
that you're planning a date?
Can you forget about it?
In any case,
we must cancel Rintaro's access to
the Third World War.
Don't you want to say goodbye to her?
Yeah, you're right.
It won't take long.
What?
I wanted to say goodbye.
Have you already
said goodbye to Maho?
Of course.
That's good.
How many times
have I said goodbye to you?
What?
Nothing.
I think I should be grateful
that you talked to me.
You can come to us, right?
I'll try not to forget you
until the next meeting.
You're such a tsundere.
What? What are you talking about?
You're all red.
Kurisu is so shy.
Professor, it's time.
What? Already?
Don't tease Hiyaji so often, okay?
I know myself.
Bye.
One day...
Yeah?
I hope you'll smile
from the bottom of your heart.
Bye.
Okabe!
Thank you for everything.
You saved me.
I would argue.
No, it's true.
I'm very grateful.
Thank you.
So...
Professor Leskin and Hiyaji
have returned to America.
Time goes on.
Nothing has changed.
Or they repeat
and move on.
THE END
Thank you for watching.
Thank you for choosing us.
Thank you for watching.
See you next time.
Bye.
