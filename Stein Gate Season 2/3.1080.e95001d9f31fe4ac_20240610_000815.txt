It will be great if you come too.
Even me?
Even me?
And Fubuki, Kaede and Yuki too.
You are my cosplay team.
Of course, you can come.
The more people, the more fun.
I'll make a costume for you, so come.
Seriously?
Even if all this is for our winter costumes?
I'll make it from now on.
I'll make a costume for you, so come.
Seriously?
Even if all this is for our winter costumes?
Even if all this is for our winter costumes?
I'll do my best.
I'll make costumes that you'll like.
So wait for it.
That's it. Now you're definitely my bride.
Come for me.
Fubuki is so active.
You'll wear a costume of Santa too, right, Mayuri?
What?
But Mayusha usually only sews costumes.
I object. I agree with Yuki.
You can't miss this opportunity.
Right.
In addition, I'm sure that Akaba will not mind
looking at you in a costume.
Akarin, right?
And Akarin is...
Ah, this is Mayusha's boyfriend.
What?
Isn't that so?
Akarin doesn't meet Mayusha.
Yes, of course.
You get along so well that it's hard to believe it.
But it's true.
Just...
Akarin already has a favorite person.
That's it.
And we get along so well with Akarin.
Just because we're childhood friends.

Episode 3
The Protocol of the Double-edged Gospel
The Protocol of the Day X
Denki Tokyo University, Division 7
I asked you not to call during classes.
But I called when you had a break.
What?
I checked the schedule of classes on the site of your university.
You're ignoring me.
You see, I had important things to do.
And what are these things?
Well...
Well...
Well...
At least come up with a good excuse in advance.
At least come up with a good excuse in advance.
Anyway, stop calling me.
Anyway, stop calling me.
It's all because you didn't keep any promises.
Promises?
It means you don't remember.
You said you'd show me your lab.
There's nothing from the lab.
Just a place to rest.
But...
But I really went there, didn't I?
But...
But I really went there, didn't I?
But...
Why are you so shy?
Is something wrong?
I'm getting a call. I'll hang up.
I'm listening.
Akarin?
You know what?
The others in the T-shirt said they'd come to the Christmas party.
Really? That's great.
And...
I bought a lot of material for our costumes.
So can you help me bring it all home?
So can you help me bring it all home?
Okay.
See you in the lab after class.
Okay. See you then.
Akarin said he'd come.
That's great, isn't it?
Only Suzu is left.
Did you tell her?
Yeah, but I'm not sure she'll come.
But she's usually in the lab, isn't she?
But she's usually in the lab, isn't she?
Yeah, but when someone comes, she always runs away.
Yeah, but when someone comes, she always runs away.
You're gonna make it, aren't you?
You're gonna make it, aren't you?
You're gonna make it, aren't you?
Oh, you're so cute.
Oh, you're so cute.
I'm turning off the phone.
Wait, turn off the phone so I can see.
And you don't have to look at the screen.
Okay.
Oh, no, it doesn't matter.
Oh, no, it doesn't matter.
It's harder than I imagined.
Radio building?
Hey!
What are you doing?
Hey!
Oh, is that Akabe?
Good afternoon.
Long time no see.
Who's that?
Be quiet.
Oh my God, you've changed so much.
Now you look like a real student.
Go on in the same spirit.
Be quiet!
This is the lab.
Is it here?
It's so dirty.
Is that all you can say?
Oh, sorry, let me rephrase.
Is this a real dump?
In the lab, it's usually always dirty,
wherever you look.
But you've crossed all the boundaries.
I told you, it's not what you imagined.
It's more like the rest of the lab.
And it's very similar to Kunatumahu.
And it's very similar to Kunatumahu.
Is it possible to spread
such personal information?
Maybe you should tell her about it too?
Tell her to clean up more often.
Tell her to clean up more often.
If I tell her,
she'll bite my head off.
However,
I've always dreamed of living
with someone together.
With my own personal forks,
spoons, and stuff.
Oh, you're already here, Karin!
Tutturu!
Are you listening to music?
Is that your friend?
Bye.
Did you talk to someone?
Don't worry.
Did you talk about it?
How many things?
Because I'm going to make a Santa costume
and a Kami-ma umbrella at the same time.
A Christmas party?
And everyone's coming?
Fubuki, Kaede, Yuki, Roko, and Ferris.
Even Yuki?
Of course!
Do you know what Mayusha thinks?
Daru and Yuki are perfect for each other.
And Fubuki says
it's impossible.
Searching.
Your and my first mission.
Ah...
Okidoki?
Good answer.
Ah, sister Rumi.
Oh, you're here.
Ah, sister Rumi.
What? Sister Rumi?
Who's that?
Ferris? It's Ferris.
If you don't show up
on time,
the guys will start worrying about you.
If I go home,
I want to say
that I don't mind being alone.
I brought you a snack.
Everything you like.
They won't get spoiled until tomorrow.
So don't hurry and eat.
Thank you.
How's Daru's
time machine research going?
He's trying very hard.
But...
It's not that easy, is it?
I'm sorry
for these difficulties.
It's all right.
I'm just renting these two floors.
Nothing more.
Nothing more?
Honestly, I owe you
so much.
Don't worry about it.
You need all this to save
the world from being beaten.
I'm always ready to help you.
I see.
I don't understand everything, but thank you.
Sister. Dad.
For everyone's sake.
I need to take Uncle Ocarina with me.
To the entrance to the Gate of Stein.
Institute of Neurology.
24th?
On Christmas Eve?
Why don't you request a report on another day?
I asked Rintaro,
and he'll be able to meet with us.
Do you have any plans on that day?
No, nothing.
I'm free.
Then why don't you
dress up as Santa
and invite him?
In this country,
to say that you have no plans
on Christmas Eve
is equal to saying that you're lonely.
And that means
Rintaro doesn't have...
Why does everything always end up like this?
Everything you can talk about with her.
Okay, it just annoys me.
What?
Aren't you interested in finding out
what kind of relationship
Rintaro and Amadeus could have?
You shouldn't worry about safety.
After all, the system
is based on memory
and is fully reliable.
It doesn't bother me.
I'm just worried.
What's wrong?
What kind of greeting is that?
I'm worried.
Request for a displacement model.
For Okabe Rintaro.
Aren't you tired yet?
Oh, we haven't been
around that corner yet.
I won't let myself
be late for a meeting.
It'll only take a minute.
You have another
365 seconds to spare
before this meeting.
Oh my God.
Are you interested?
It's a shame I can't go by myself.
I know.
And if you connect your phone
to the radio-controlled camera,
then I can...
Never.
Why not?
Why are you so loud
even though you can't say a word
on a group date?
How did you...
You forgot to close the app yourself.
And I've been listening to you all this time.
It was so hard to keep quiet.
Your classmates were terrible.
They started to get to know you.
You've completely fooled people.
Wait.
When we meet with Hiyaji and the professor,
they'll know all this from your code.
Of course. And all I heard will be there.
Yeah.
Moreover,
all the conversations are recorded too.
For example, your family sells vegetables.
But you hate eggplant.
And you called me Christina
when we first met.
Stop it.
Christina.
You're so stubborn.
Human memories are not permanent.
Over time, new ones appear
and everything is intertwined.
What are you talking about?
Unfortunately, Amadeus is not
a full-fledged artificial intelligence.
My memories are permanent.
I can't forget other words.
Well,
Amadeus was talking about
forgetfulness during the presentation.
This is a process of creating
information that is accessible from a data point of view.
All this is stored somewhere.
And you never asked me to repeat
what you said.
Exactly.
Aren't you too na√Øve?
Your deviation from the answer
interested me.
Curiosity ruined the window.
Such things never stopped
researchers like me.
Rintaro!
I'm sorry.
I came on time, but...
What were you doing there?
Cutting circles alone in such a place.
It's much more important
that you think about Curie.
It's very strange.
I know
that she is, but...
It seems that you can
tell us a lot of interesting things.
You know,
I was planning to check
the data at the university,
but...
You're free tonight.
You can join us for dinner.
You need to get it earlier.
In the evening?
I'm sorry.
I already promised my friends
that I would come to a Christmas party today.
A party?
Dad?
Wow!
What a lovely
Rintaro laboratory you have!
Thank you for inviting us.
Japanese maid?
Or Neko girl?
Who's that?
I told you on the phone.
Hiyaji and Professor Leskin.
They help me at the university.
Is it true that everything is fine?
We will not interfere with
your friendly visits.
Rintaro said that we can come,
and that means everything is fine.
No, I meant
that it's just being polite.
You almost made him do it.
Don't you like this company?
What's the difference?
How old are you?
I'm sorry.
I'm older than I look.
What?
Yes.
What a lovely
Rintaro laboratory you have!
A lot of beautiful girls!
In fact,
some of them are surprisingly sexy.
That's a guy.
Juicy chicken number one!
These are only sold
for Christmas.
Will Suzuka come at all?
Yes.
We sent Daru to this mission.
Daru?
I hope he will persuade her to come.
Persuade?
Yes.
She won't come if she finds out
that it's a party, so he's going to trick her.
Daru.
I've put a lot on my shoulders.
They're coming.
Daru said they would be coming soon.
Great!
Everyone to their places!
Yes!
Hey!
Hey!
I'm here!
And I brought Suzuka!
Dad, stop!
What?
Merry Christmas!
Welcome, Suzuka!
What?
Hey!
Mom!
Suzuka!
It's Christmas!
It's a surprise!
It's just a party!
I'm sorry.
I just wanted to surprise you.
I'm sorry.
I just wanted to surprise you.
I just wanted to surprise you.
That's why
the brother behaved so strange.
I'm sorry.
Mayusha planned all this.
No, I'm not angry.
It's great.
The lab doesn't look like it.
Yes, everyone helped with the decorations.
Mayusha
organized a party.
I hope it will cheer you up.
I see.
But I hope
it's not for fun.
It will be good for you without me.
It will be good for you without me.
You'd better stay.
Enjoy it.
Exactly!
We'll all have dinner together.
Stay, eat with us
and be grateful for the food.
Okay?
Now it's time to drink for us.
One, two!
Happy Christmas!
Let's drink!
Karin,
we're going to give each other presents.
I'll be back soon.
I have a hypothesis.
What is it?
The first thought.
Your favorite Hollywood actress
is called Christina.
I made a mistake.
No, it's not true.
The second thought.
Your ex-girlfriend is called...
Oh, no, that's not it.
I'm sorry.
Don't give up.
Did you meet someone?
A direct silence for a negative answer.
Shut up.
The third thought.
Directly or indirectly,
you called me the way I am.
But the probability is not high.
And why?
Because I would have answered
not to add Tina,
or something like that.
Okay,
a little closer,
a little closer.
Yes.
I'm absolutely against it.
I'm sorry.
No,
don't.
It's not your fault, Naya.
You're so cute.
And everything immediately became beautiful.
Okabe is late.
Yeah.
I'll go get him.
Does it mean
that I'm right?
Stop making guesses.
Then answer me straight.
Do you want to know
why?
Yes.
I was embarrassed.
What?
I couldn't call you normally,
so I was teasing.
You...
about my name?
Yes.
Well,
thank you for telling me.
Why were you embarrassed?
What?
I wasn't embarrassed, no.
If you think that
you got me in trouble
talking to me like a girl,
then it's not like that at all.
What?
I...
It's...
part of you that I...
What?
I...
What?
What?
Senpai!
Hiyaji!
What are you doing?
I told you.
It's easy to cheat.
Don't make a mistake.
This is
Amadeus,
not Makise Kurisu.
It's...
Makise Kurisu...
is dead.
Dead.
She's gone.
Dead.
Kukabe!
What?
Kukabe!
Thank you for your time
and work with the sound of Hikariya,

viewing.
