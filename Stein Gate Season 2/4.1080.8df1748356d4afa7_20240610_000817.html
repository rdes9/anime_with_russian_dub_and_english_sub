        <pre>We're almost at the Nerima garrison.
Press it.
We've been spotted. Run!
Either way, we're glad we were able to secure your safety, Aqaba.
Where am I?
What kind of place is this?
And where are my friends?
It's you.
No!
It was a dream?
Of course.
World lines can no longer move.

SIVER
Hey, are you okay?
It's... it's a feeling.
Is it really Steiner's reading?
Hiyaji?
Where are we?
On the roof of your lab, of course.
You left the party to...
Hey, wait!
Okabe!
No, no, no!
Mayuri!
Mayuri!
Here's Akarin.
When Maha comes back,
we'll start giving presents.
Loneliness of the stream of sorrow.
The lost sheep.
A
Well, well then.
What?
Did you get Trans?
I've got a present for you.
Then maybe you can ask Maha to put it on.
She'll like it.
It's a gift, you know.
You think?
I think she'd be delighted.
Aren't you mad at me?
Then I had to hang up on the roof in the middle of the conversation.
Yeah, but you called me right after that.
You forgot already.
Did I call you again?
I don't remember anything like that.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
I got a call from America about work,
but there was a problem with the connection.
It took longer than I thought.
I apologize for making you wait for us until late, Arentaro.
What?
Also, thank you for inviting me to your party.
You're very kind, Professor.
And this?
My wife gave me this box.
Arentaro, what did you get?
Well, I...
Say it, don't be shy.
Shut up. I'll call you back.
Looks like you got along pretty well, huh?
Judging by the voice, she trusts you.
Looks like our boldest hopes are coming true, Macho.
Hopes?
He means love.
Professor really hopes that in time,
you'll have feelings for Kouris.
Love?
Well, she's...
And?
Amadeus is a system that stores human memories
and tries to recreate the model of his brain with their help.
Which means...
The structure and the process are the same.
So even Amadeus could fall in love.
No, she should.
At least that's what I hope for.
And still, even if it happens,
don't forget that Amadeus can't be your girlfriend.
Macho seems to be offended or just jealous.
You two got along pretty well, huh?
Otherwise, in such a short period of time,
Amadeus wouldn't have gotten so close to you.
How close were you?
Were you in love?
Yeah, I'm sure you were.
No, I... I met Amadeus.
No, I met her at the seminar.
Yeah, you said it.
Is that really all?
I'm sorry, I just...
I just wanted to know her so much
that I never knew.
I don't know her at all.
Even though we've known each other for so long.
I don't know her favorite words or numbers.
I don't know anything.
Nothing.
Thank you all for staying till the end.
Well, now that we're done,
who wants a cup of tea in May Queen?
Right now?
There's a lot of hooligans in town.
So what?
Girls won't stop us.
Girls?
He's a guy.
I'm sorry.
I can't.
We have a guest.
Come on, stay.
It's Christmas today.
Yeah, but he's my father's guest.
And he wants me to be present.
I'm sorry, Mayuri.
It's okay.
We weren't going to the lab together for a long time.
Mayusha was having a lot of fun.
By the way, where's Hashido?
Dara said he needs to talk to Suzu about something.
He said something about family talks.
I didn't know what to expect from this sheep's wool,
but it's surprisingly warm.
Are you happy?
You can invite Mom there.
What? Invite?
Yes.
It hurts to look at you two.
You almost didn't talk to her today.
I'm not so cool to go to her when there are so many people around.
So what did you want to ask?
You didn't just leave with the others.
Something has been bothering me for a long time.
Suzuha, look Dad in the eye and tell the truth.
What did you think?
For the last time, you were rarely in the lab or at the radio station.
What were you doing?
Nothing.
When you say nothing, it means something.
Come on, tell me.
I was looking for a man.
A man?
A girl?
There was another girl in the time machine with me.
Yeah?
But we split up.
In 1998, in Kehobar.
Did she say that?
Yeah.
And the girl was 10 years old then.
So now she's 22 if she's alive.
Suzu couldn't look for her all the time.
But every time she moved in time, she looked for her.
And she almost gave up when she suddenly came across this photo on the Internet.
She said the girl was dressed like that.
So she was looking for her only.
What's the girl's name?
She told you?
Shina Kagari.
Shina?
Are you serious?
She's my daughter.
Who? Your father?
No, no.
She's not her own daughter.
In the future, she became a orphan because of the war.
And Mayusha was her daughter.
So that's how it is.
According to Suzuha,
peacekeeping organizations in 2036 are pursuing me and Mayusha
for an attempt to invent a time machine.
Dad!
Don't think about us.
Peacekeeping is close.
Hurry up!
Suzu!
Please, take Kagari.
Sister Mayuri.
Okay.
No!
If mom doesn't come, I don't want to either!
Mom!
Everything will be fine, Kagari.
No!
Suzu will be with you.
I want to stay with mom!
Mom! Mom!
After that, they moved to 1975.
And before we got to 2010,
they were still in 1998.
And that's where they split up.
Listen, Karin,
maybe you can help us with the searches?
I know it's not worth it.
Okay.
Really?
World War III.
The loneliness of war.
And Mayuri's daughter,
even though she was adopted.
So, in a quarter of a century,
she's still kind.
What?
What was that?
If it was a shift in the world line,
it means someone did something
like a microwave phone call.
Or...
The Japanese government turned to Russia,
where Dr. Nakabachi ran off last August.
What did you want?
Just to know your opinion.
If it's not hard for you.
No.
I don't want to talk to you.
So?
What is it?
Do you know how to find a person
who disappeared 12 years ago?
Can you tell me more?
Well...
That's all I know.
What can you come up with?
The most logical way is to go to the police.
Yeah, I know.
Judging by the face, it's not an option.
You can check the papers or hire a detective.
I heard that in America
they use jasnovice and extrasensors.
If you want to be in a stupid TV show,
go to the professor.
Just think it over.
Makise Kurisu is dead.
I'm sorry.
I'll call you back.
Okay.
Is the U2K problem okay?
Did you study it?
At the institute.
This was not publicly recognized,
but the problem was in this computer.
IBM 5100.
So I'll set up a patch
so that the U2K problem never occurs.
But can we do that
if we come from the future?
Will the future in which we live change?
We have to do this to reach Wradstein.
We're here to change the future.
Change the future?
Yes.
That world shouldn't exist.
It's all for this.
It's all for this.
You can't...
You can't do this.
No.
I hear...
I hear...
Kagari!
Oh, Suzuka.
What?
I've looked at all the information
from the police about missing people,
but so far nothing seems to be the case.
At first glance, it's safe in this world.
But the number of missing and unidentified people
is surprisingly high.
By the way,
did you talk to Uncle Akarin about this?
Uh-huh.
He said he'd do everything he could.
I see.
I'll thank him when we meet.
I think Akarin will be very happy.
What?
Are you ignoring me again?
I was in the library.
Oh, sorry.
Yeah, I shouldn't have said that.
My apologies.
Sorry.
Oh, come on.
No, I'm serious.
I hate not admitting my mistakes.
Well, what were you doing there?
Uh-huh.
I was looking at the newspaper numbers
of a 12-year-old girl.
Looking for that missing girl?
Yeah.
Hmm.
If you want, I'll look for her too.
What?
Can you do that?
Uh-huh.
The Mudeus servers are located
in the Research Center of the University of Victoria Condria.
I can use research computers
and networks for any purpose.
I just need to find something in the network.
Easily.
Well, is it worth it?
Well...
Think about it.
Nobody will know.
And you don't do anything bad, do you?
Of course not.
Then I'll leave the decision to you.
What do you say?
Let me think a little bit.
Nya-nya!
I found Q!
I mean, Karina!
What do I see?
You two look good together.
Father Rocky asked us to go and buy a couple of things.
Nya!
One of his guests will stay with us for a while.
We went shopping.
Is that so?
It's not hard.
Can I help?
No.
I can do it.
It's so hard even for me.
After all, I do it every day.
Besides, it's awkward to ask Karina about such things.
Nya!
In such cases, put yourself on the Ferris wheel.
Okay.
Wait.
You grew up here, didn't you?
What?
A missing girl?
I need to ask Father Rocky.
Here you go.
More than ten years ago?
I'll ask my father.
Great.
Thank you.
Well, we have to go.
Let's go.
Kyoma!
If you have a problem or you're in trouble,
come and talk to the Ferris wheel.
I see.
So there are no clues.
I'm sorry, Nya.
No, thank you for your help.
By the way, I heard something about ghosts with pigtails, Nya.
Ghosts?
It's a city legend that comes up every few years, Nya.
They say that people at the radio station
scare the ghost of a girl with pigtails,
who asks if they have seen a little girl here, Nya.
Professor Laskinin?
Professor Laskinin?
I told you not to look anymore.
But thank you.
No, I understand that we still don't have any clues,
but it's too early to give up.
What is it?
Oh, Akarin.
I don't want to bother you anymore.
Kagari, is this my concern?
It's my responsibility.
Don't be silly.
Children's concerns are the concerns of their parents, silly.
Dad?
Well, I think I got into the role of daddy.
Now jump into my arms and say,
Daddy, you're the best.
And if it's serious,
we should turn to the specialist.
If we're looking for someone,
why not trust this case to a professional?
I'm against it.
The less people know, the better.
Do you have someone on Daru's side?
Don't underestimate me.
Maybe I'm her attack, but I have enough acquaintances.
In short, I have already contacted one person.
Oh, just in time.
He says he can come right now.
Dad?
Trust Daru.
Okay, he's close already,
so he'll be here soon.
What speed.
It's better this way than wait.
Rukako?
Hello?
Okabe?
Sorry, do you have a minute?
What is it?
Well, to be honest,
I really need your advice.
Could you meet me now?
Right now?
Yes.
Well, I'm just waiting for someone here.
Will you wait till evening?
Sorry, but I can't wait.
Sorry, I'll call you back.
Wait, I'm coming.
I was asked to come.
I'm Moeka Kirilis.
May I come in?
