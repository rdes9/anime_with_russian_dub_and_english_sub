        <pre>You traitors!
I don't know, and I don't understand.
There is nothing, but a cross.
And a skull there.
Mayuri! Mayuri!
Akarin?
You're finally awake.
Thank God!
We were so scared when you fainted.
I fainted?
You fainted?
You fainted?
You fainted?
Mayuri!
Mayuri!
Mayuri!
Mayuri!
Mayuri!
Mayuri!
Mayuri!
Mayuri!
Mayuri!
Mayuri!
Mayuri!
Mayuri!
Mayuri!
I'm at the lab.
The hospital is closed in the new year,
so we're going crazy.
Mayuri!
Mayuri!
Mayuri!
Mayuri!
Mayuri!
Mayuri!
Mayuri!
Mayuri!
Mayuri!
Mayuri!
Mayuri!
So, we were going crazy there.
So, well, I'm back to my world line.
Here.
Makise Kurisu.
Do you know Makise Kurisu?
I know her.
Isn't that the girl on your phone?
Amadeus or something like that?
Don't scare me like that.
By the way, what about Amadeus?
He's under our control, but he's still being restored.
However...
What's the problem?
We found out that someone sneaked into Maho's room.
And that's not all.
They say that there was a gas explosion in the office.
That's why the entrance is closed.
Judging by everything, someone carefully planned all this.
Do you have any suggestions?
No.
Maybe those people attacked us?
Oh, you're up already.
Did the temperature drop?
Yeah, it's okay now.
And Karin, are you feeling better?
Uh, yeah.
The doctors say that it could be some kind of new form of encephalitis.
But I don't think there's anything to worry about.
About brain inflammation?
They say that there was a flash of infection.
It's because of the temperature and all that.
But why did you both lose consciousness at the same time?
Without interference, the probability of such a coincidence is extremely low.
I knew it! It's him!
You again?
What?
Do you think that Karin is my soulmate or something like that?
But Fubuki...
When you came to your senses, you only talked about him.
I told you! It's because of my dream!
Dream?
I had a very realistic dream.
But Mayusha...
It was a dream!
I just dreamed that Mayusha was dead.
And I worked at the Cafe Alvarez.
But then Karin came.
Remembrance from the world alpha line.
Are we really counting Steiner?
So, the symptoms seem to have gone.
But I'll give you a check-up.
Come next week.
Of course.
It's good that you were discharged, Karin.
Fubuki will have to stay there for now.
But it's okay.
She's strong, she doesn't care about anything.
You think so? You're probably right.
For now.
Why did you ask about Coris?
Well, do you see?
I had a dream.
A dream?
By the way, where is Hashida?
Daru left, saying that he needs to do something.
Monday, January 3, 2011.
Anything else?
Yeah.
Karin's symptoms disappeared, so he was discharged.
But Karin and the others attacked him.
And then this fainting.
What happened when he came to his senses?
Well, everything is as usual.
But he called his name, Makise.
Makise?
See you.
Yeah, I'll text you.
Here's your coffee.
Thank you.
Because of all this fuss and robberies in my room and the fire in the office,
I haven't eaten anything since yesterday.
We only have bananas and fried chicken.
Oh, do you want me to buy you bento?
No, I'll eat when I get to the hotel.
Will you come back?
The professor asked the same thing.
He suggested we move somewhere.
That would be safer.
But I don't know where to go.
What about here?
I don't want to impose myself.
Considering that we've been attacked here, it's not safe.
No signs of us.
Yes.
How did you get here?
Is this your acquaintance?
Yes.
When you...
When you...
Were you here all this time?
Yes.
What's going on?
Why did you keep quiet?
Oh, nothing.
Coffee!
Your guest left already?
And I even made her coffee.
I'm back.
I'll save this world.
I'll protect my world in this world.
And I'll do it without a time machine.
I'm sure that's what she wanted.
That's all I can do.
Hey, Adjo.
Could you time the search for a new hotel?
I have an idea.
So that's what you came for, nya?
Yes.
We think it's best for her to stay here for now.
It's so sudden.
We shouldn't have made it hard for you.
It's not hard at all, nya.
It's true.
You see, I told you.
You see, I told you.
Ferris would never refuse you.
You can sleep in the guest room, nya.
Stay here for the time being.
Maho-nyan just has to stay here while she's in Japan.
Maho-nyan, we have Kuroki.
So it's super safe here, nya.
Kuroki, come here.
Hey, wait.
Let's take a bath, nya.
There's nothing to worry about now.
By the way, is Kagari Tsurukaku here?
Yes.
I talked to him recently.
He promised to keep an eye on her so that she wouldn't go anywhere.
At this moment, I did everything I could.
It remains to find out who and why attacked the lab.
Suzuha?
Suzuha?
I'm here.
Sorry for calling you out so suddenly.
What's the matter?
I don't know how to talk smoothly to people.
So I'm sorry, but I'll ask directly.
What?
Has the world line changed?
What are you talking about?
Judging by the current situation and your conversation with the reading line,
and so on...
And what if I tell you?
Maybe you didn't know, but it's very important to me.
Suzuha?
Answer me.
I'm ordering you.
Okabarintaro.
Pandora of Eternal Return.
Pandora's Box.
I'm asking again.
Has the world line changed?
This is not the world line that was before.
Don't worry.
It's the same world line as before.
Really?
Yes.
We temporarily moved to another world line,
but now we're back.
But it still changed.
Well, I don't know why it happened.
Earthquake in Russia.
They are not the result of nuclear tests.
Russia and America started a race to invent a time machine.
Sooner or later, this confrontation will be the beginning of the Third World War.
Russia and America?
Apparently, this is some kind of signal code.
Signal code?
For the military.
They use it in the West.
So what?
So, that time...
I was such a fool.
I thought I could do it, but I didn't find the time machine.
What are you going to do?
You're coming back with me on July 28.
What if I refuse?
I won't let you.
While we're talking, the time machine is being developed.
What if the world line changes and the way to the Stein Gate is forever closed?
What if it's too late?
Would you be able to choose?
Choose one of the two world lines.
Are you ready to allow this world line to turn into nothing?
Shut up!
Susha...
This is a warning.
Please.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
July 2010.
I used my body as a alarm and realized that I could send a message to the past.
But as a result, it led only to the change of the world line.
In order to return, I changed other people's lives as I had to.
I saw the events and didn't let them happen.
I sacrificed more than you can imagine just to return to this world line.
And now, if I return for a hundred years, this nightmare will repeat itself.
So you're happy with this world line?
When the Third World War begins, billions of people will die.
This is not an escape from the reality of this world.
What if we only make it worse?
That...
What if we change the world line, but the future awaits us even worse than the one you know?
Even if we can change the world line, we can't predict the future.
Suzuhai!
Dad.
I figured out what was going to happen.
Why do you need a gun?
Dad, you have to understand.
We don't have time for this.
At this pace, the Third World War...
Even if you force Akarin to go to war, you can't do anything about it.
Do you think this will solve anything?
But this...
Since I've been doing all the research on the time machine and the world lines, I've come to understand something.
Attempting to control the world lines and the law of reason.
It's not an easy task.
Then what do we do?
We need research, don't we?
Dad!
At times like this, I want you to listen and do what Dad says.
Give it to me.
I'll come up with something.
Don't forget, I'm a super hacker after all.
I don't know what to do anymore.
I don't know what's right.
Help me, Dad.
Help me.
Dad!
Help me!
Dad!
The Third World War...
With the help of the information we have...
Can we somehow change the future by using the time machine?
It's a difficult question.
But it's clear that it's impossible not to check it.
It's a piece of cake for scientists.
You could say that.
What?
If you came to ask for an increase...
I want to continue our conversation.
What?
Seriously?
Yes.
Who knows?
This information is not enough.
If you tell me what organizations use the time machines, it may help.
Well, only in the West there are a thousand of them.
However...
However?
If some organization is behind that attack, I don't think their name is known to the public.
So either this is a deeply classified organization,
or a company that at first glance is engaged in something ordinary and will not be suspected.
For example?
Are you seriously waiting for me to answer?
Although you already know too much.
To be honest, if everything you told me is true, I would assume that this is...
DARPA.
The management of the main research projects.
Created by the US Department of Defense for military research.
Stratfor.
A private analytical company in America.
It is called the Shadow Empire, because they prevent major terrorist acts.
The Russians create a time machine based on the articles of Dr. Nakabachi.
Dad, did you really steal it?
If the Americans were to compare all the facts,
then the pursuit of information would lead them to Makise Kurisu.
But why not just capture the University of Victorikondria?
So they could easily connect to the computer.
Why did they have to go here?
When they attacked us, they needed Kagari.
Because she is from the future?
Are they looking for a time machine in which she got here?
Even if so, they definitely won't find her.
Why?
If the development of a time machine was based on a time machine from the future,
then there would be a time paradox.
It can't be true.
So...
Someone got into Konatumoha.
And that's not all.
They say that there was a gas explosion in the office in Vaku.
So that's it.
You know what?
I think that one day Okarin will take everything in his own hands
and take everyone where we want to go.
How much time?
A wonderful new day will come soon.
Do you think he can do it?
Uncle Okarin, get into the time machine.
When the time comes, he will be able to do it.
And then Koin Kyouma will be reborn.
He will rise from the ashes like a phoenix.
He will rise again like a monster.
In the end, the laboratory of gadgets of the future exists only thanks to him.
Dad, do you even understand how awkward this sounds?
Yes, you're probably right.
I would rather die than tell him this face.
I think I'll write a letter.
And I have to apologize to Uncle Okarin and say that this will not happen again.
Good idea.
And if that's the case, write to Dad again.
And add cute photos.
If there is time.
Hey, that sounded kind of sad.
I mean, we don't have time for such things.
Because Russia has started the time machine development?
And this too.
But I'm a little hot.
I probably used too much while looking for Kagari.
Can't you change the battery?
No.
I asked Aunt Rumi to bring one of the big trucks.
But he immediately sat down.
And how long can we do the jumps?
For six months.
Maybe one or two.
And that's it.
What if he discharges during the jump?
I don't know.
Maybe by losing control, we will forever be stuck on the horizon of events?
Don't say that. You'll get it.
Sorry.
Hmm.
But I wonder what it would be like there.
Maybe it would be as quiet as I am now until the end of time.
If so, I would not refuse.
Hiyajo!
What's up?
What happened here?
It's a mess.
A mess?
As for me, it's very cozy here.
Well, it's only been one day.
It's dangerous to go outside, so I have to work here.
So what is it?
Yes.
Koresu developed the time machine theory?
Yes.
Apparently, they are hunting for its developments.
Perhaps part of the theory is inside Amadeus.
Have you seen anything like that?
For example, some notes or fragments of information.
If there is something like that, it will explain the attack.
It seems ...
nothing.
I see.
It's Amadeus.
Amadeus.
Amadeus.
Amadeus.
Amadeus.
Amadeus.
Amadeus.
Amadeus.
Amadeus.
Amadeus.
