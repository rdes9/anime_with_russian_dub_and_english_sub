How are you feeling, mom?
Did you finish your treatment today?
Yeah, you did a good job.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, you did a good job.
You're a good girl.
And I have good news for the good girl Kagari.
News?
All the paperwork is over.
I'm sorry for taking so long.
But from this day on, I'm your real mom.
We can live together.
Mom!
Oh my god, Kagari.
You're so spoiled.
What's that song?
It's a very important song for me.
Important?
Yeah.
Thanks to this song, mom and Kagari were able to meet.
Really?
Yeah.
That's why you have to try hard and remember.
Because one day you will meet someone important to you.
I want to learn this song.
Please teach me.
Yeah.
Let's sing together.
Yeah.
Good, good.

Okabe.
Professor Uzaki?
I must say that your report was amazing.
Really?
Thanks a lot.
I never thought I could study abroad.
Maybe.
I am actually concerned for you.
But if you talk about your last job,
Hey, Kagari, do you want some juicy chicken wings?
This is my favorite dish.
Oh, you don't mind?
No, they're very tasty, and I wanted you to try them.
Thank you, then I don't mind.
You're always welcome.
Will you have some?
Of course.
Thank you.
You're always welcome.
Will you have some?
I'll have a couple.
Great. Wait a minute.
What?
It's a song. I know it.
Kagari?
A long time ago...
Somewhere...
Somewhere...
Kagari?
Hey!
Kagari, hold on!
Kagari!
Mayuri, how's Kagari?
Karin!
Is she unconscious again?
She's asleep.
Suzuka...
Can we talk?
We haven't seen each other in a long time.
Yeah.
What would you like me to know?
I won't make it to Wradstein Valley.
It's obvious.
Sorry.
I wonder if she'll come back.
The memory of Kagari.
Right.
This girl is a war orphan.
I've never seen her parents.
I think she only had bad memories.
But...
The meeting with Mayuri completely changed her life.
Thanks to her,
she still learned to smile.
When she ran away,
she pointed a gun at me.
She said if the line changed,
she wouldn't see her mom again.
She was 10 years old.
Maybe her memory will come back.
Or maybe not.
But...
What would be the best outcome for her?
If her memory comes back,
she can remember something about people
who once attacked her.
In any case,
I'm going to do everything I can.
It won't change.
Take care of Kagari, okay?
Mom.
Mom!
What?
It happened again.
Are you okay?
Yes.
Mayuri left recently.
I think they just don't have enough people for lunch.
Mayuri was worried about you.
I see.
Are you feeling better?
I heard a song.
And then my head...
A song?
Did you hear it before?
Yes.
Did you hear it recently?
No, I don't think so.
A song...
What do you think, Shakarin?
You can't say for sure.
It could be a reason for her memory to come back.
Really?
If it's not hard for you,
you can do an investigation.
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
Well?
How was the inspection?
I'm fine, as always.
You've been here for half a month.
I've been here for half a month.
You've been here for half a month.
I'm fine, as always.
You've been here for half a month.
Karin doesn't go to the inspection.
Why should I?
It's great that you don't have any problems.
I have problems.
I gain weight when I'm in the hospital,
and I can't get rid of it.
Hey, don't you want to go to karaoke together?
I'm sorry, but I already have plans.
That's it, I have to go.
Let's go to karaoke another time.
Yuki, in front of you!
It hurts!
God, I can't believe she's so clumsy.
Exactly.
Kagari, are you feeling better?
Yes, I'm sorry for bothering you.
No, I'm sorry I couldn't stay with you.
A song?
Yes, the song you sang earlier.
I think I've already heard it.
Do you happen to remember where you heard it?
The thing is, maybe this song can bring back memories of Kagari.
Let me think.
Mayu first heard it from Suzu.
Suzu?
Yes, I sometimes saw her singing it while looking out the window.
But Mayu doesn't know what this song is called.
Maybe it's a popular song from the future?
I'm sorry, I can't help you anymore.
No, thank you for telling us.
Hey, Karin, are you going to Suzu now?
Yes, I need to talk to her.
Can I go too?
Are you sure?
You know, it's hard to explain.
But when I look at Kagari, I want to do everything I can to help.
May I?
Mayuri...
What about work?
There are fewer people, so everything is fine.
In any case, we need to call first.
What if she's busy?
If that's the case, she still has lunch.
By the way, I saw Suzu recently.
Really?
What?
Suzu?
Rumi's sister.
Why are you so grumpy?
It's...
I'm going to go to battle.
She told me so!
She can't!

I'm not full yet.
I'm so full.
I'm so full.
I'm so full.
I'm so full.
I'm so full.
I'm so full.
I'm so full.
I'm so full.
I'm so full.
I'm so full.
I'm so full.
I'm so full.
I'm so full.
You can eat what you want but you can't eat anything.
Is that an fundamental rule of survival?
And I was just as worried.
Oh my God.
I can't believe you heard me sing.
I heard it from Yuki.
Yuki?
When you talk about Yuki, do you mean the future?
Yes. Mom always sang it when she was preparing for us.
So Kagari heard the song either from you or from Yuki?
Impossible.
Mayuri gave birth to Kagari after mom's death.
I've never sang about Kagari before.
Kagari from Mayuri, Mayuri from Suzuha, Suzuha from Yuki.
It's like a broken phone.
Doesn't it pick up?
Yes, maybe it's working now.
There's no way out. So let's wait until it calls back.
Akabe?
This is...
Hey, it's Yuki.
Wait, together...
With Daru?
You have a little sauce around your mouth.
What? I'll wipe it myself.
I don't even think about touching my face.
It only spoils the handkerchief.
And it doesn't spoil at all.
So, so, are they on a date?
Is this a date?
So they're dating.
Actually, that bastard said he had things to do.
What are we going to do, Akarin?
Well, we can't get in their way.
We'll ask later.
Is it good, Kagari?
Yes, but...
I'm sorry for the intrusion.
It's okay. The more, the better.
Of course.
So, what about the song?
Well, you know, I sometimes help with the baking courses.
Yuki makes the most delicious sweets that can only be tried.
Really?
Do you want to cook together?
Yes, of course.
So, wait a minute.
What does it have to do with the song?
One of the students who comes to us often sings it.
Does she sing it?
Yes, and now I can't forget her.
Is there any chance that we know this woman?
I'm not sure.
She's a very beautiful woman.
Well, then it's unlikely.
Exactly.
I think it will be easier to ask.
Yes, I'll give it to him now.
What?
Excuse me?
This is Akabe, my friend.
Akabe?
Yes.
To be honest, I just wanted to ask you something.
Akabe?
Yes.
To be honest, I just wanted to ask you about the song.
This voice.
Is that you, Rinutaro?
It's me, me.
This voice!
It can't be!
Sorry, but don't tell me you forgot your mother's beautiful voice.
I can't believe it was your mother.
We call her by her name at the courses.
So, what did your mother tell you?
Well...
From you!
What?
I told you, you sang it yourself.
Me?
What are you talking about?
I don't even know her.
Remember when you were in middle school and Mayuri had depression?
Then you started acting weird.
What was it?
Oh, I'm a match psychologist.
Stop it.
In any case, you sang it all the time when you were in the bathroom.
Me?
Exactly.
Because of you, I can't forget it.
So, what does it all mean?
I have no idea.
I don't remember ever knowing such a song.
Mayuri, did you hear him sing?
Mayusha doesn't remember anything like that.
We got stuck where Akabe was.
Did I hear correctly that Mayuri was depressed?
Something happened then.
Hey, Akarin, maybe we should go?
Go?
There?
Yeah.
Who knows, maybe you'll remember something.
I'm glad you came to visit me, Akarin.
We're going to meet your grandma.
Yeah.
I'll introduce you to her, Kagari.
And I'll tell her you're Mayusha's best friend.
Mayuri...
It's...
What's wrong, Akarin?
Did you remember something?
No.
I see.
Do you want to talk to your grandma?
Yeah.
Excuse me, wait a minute.
We haven't seen each other for a long time, grandma.
You know, I have a new friend, Kagari.
It's a ritual for you.
I see.
It must be sad to lose all the memories of the past.
I wonder if they'll come back.
It would be great.
Mayuri, it's raining.
Let's go find a shelter.
Okay.
Let's go.
Mayuri, it's raining.
Let's go find a shelter.
It started to rain.
We got so wet.
We should have taken an umbrella.
I know.
You can come to my house and...
Kagari?
It's...
Mom...
Kagari?
Kagari!
Kagari!
Kagari!
I miss you.
I miss you, mom.
Mom.
Mom.
Mom!
Kagari?
Mom?
Thank God, you're finally awake.
Mom.
Kagari?
Mom!
What?
What?
I missed you, mom.
Mayuri, isn't she your mom?
Mom, it's mom.
I love you so much, mom.
Mom, my Yuri.
Her memory...
Did she really come back?
I found you.
Finally.
It's okay.
Everything will be fine now.
Mom!
