Okay, we'll go to the store.
Write to us if you need to buy something.
Okay.
Mayuri, do you mind?
Even if I stay, I won't get any benefits from it.
It's closer to the other side.
You lost your memory?
Yeah.
So all this time you couldn't remember what happened?
Really?
Suzuka, why do you think it's Kagari's tire?
I told you!
Because of this hoot!
It was Kagari's talisman.
A gift from her mother, who she cherished very much.
Kanna, where did you get it?
I don't know.
When they found me lying unconscious,
all I had was this keychain.
Unconscious?
I was lying at the border of Tibo prefecture,
when a priest passed by.
But how did you get to Rukaku?
They decided that the girl shouldn't be in the current temple for long.
The brother had hands?
She was so close!
So I'm my real name is Shina Kagari?
Don't you know anything about me?
I'm just...
Wait, calm down.
I'm sorry.
Kanna, does the name Shina Kagari tell you anything?
I don't know.
But for some reason it sounds very familiar.
Tell me, that girl...
Are you talking about Mayuri?
Her name is Mayuri.
Kagari.
Shina Kagari.
Shina Kagari.
In 2036 Mayuri was her mother.
Shina Kagari.
Shina Kagari.
Shina Kagari.
Shina Kagari.
Shina Kagari.
Shina Kagari.
Shina Kagari.
Shina Kagari.
Shina Kagari.
Shina Kagari.
Shina Kagari.
Shina Kagari.
Shina Kagari.
Shina Kagari.
Shina Kagari.
Shina Kagari.
Shina Kagari.
Shina Kagari.
Shina Kagari.
Shina Kagari.
Shina Kagari.
Shina Kagari.
Shina Kagari.
Shina Kagari.
Shina Kagari.
Shina Kagari.
Shina Kagari.
Shina Kagari.
Shina Kagari.
Shina Kagari...
One-Ã­aan!
So you and Kona... I mean, were you acquainted with Agari, Suzuka?
Yes, you could say that.
Then maybe you know where she lived or someone from her relatives?
Well, you see...
She moved when they were still children. Since then, Suzuka has not seen her.
I see. But now we know her real name.
Hey, listen, so your name is Shina Kagari, right?
Yes.
So we look alike. My name is Shina Mayuri.
Shina Mayuri?
Ruko already told me, but is it true that you have amnesia?
So you don't remember anything about yourself at all?
Yes.
That's how it should be. You are very difficult.
It turns out that you forgot all the people who were dear to you.
I think this is the saddest thing that can happen to a person.
That's why... I don't know how to say it, but...
Mayusha also wants to help you. Let's try.
What happened? Maybe I said something unnecessary?
No. For some reason, I'm very glad to hear this from you.
Mayusha is not alone in this.
I'm ready to do anything in my power.
Thank you all.
We found Shina Kagari.
Where?
She lived in the temple with my friend.
She was found unconscious in you.
Why?
I don't know. She lost her memory.
I see.
Did you hear anything about the people who were looking for her?
Not yet.
I'm sorry. At this time of year, everyone has enough work.
Work is work. What now? Not to look for them?
To be honest, you would have helped us a lot.
I see.
So...
They found her.
Mayuri is calling everyone to the temple for the New Year.
You're invited too. We'll be glad if you come.
Maho!
How do you understand that, Professor?
Are you rewriting with your lover?
Nothing like that.
Shouldn't you and Leskinen end this?
Moreover, the concept of love is only for the sake of meaning.
Yes, you're wrong here.
On the contrary, your personal life is a very interesting object for research.
Even if so, there is nothing to do with me as an experienced.
I will never let the illusion of love fool me.
What a pity.
By the way, Professor...
I'm sorry for everything.
Don't apologize.
Maho is always glad to help you. Just tell her.
Yes. Thank you again.
Rukako, do you have a minute?
Don't let Kagari out?
But it's somehow...
If she really needs it, let someone accompany her.
For now, I can't say why it's necessary.
As you say, Okabe.
Sorry.
We still don't know who was looking for Kagari.
And until we find out, it's better to take precautions.
In any case, it's good that we finally found Kagari.
You can relax now.
Yes, probably.
This is not quite the reaction I expected.
This girl, where was she all this time?
Amnesia? Yes?
I also thought about it.
But you can't do anything about it, no matter how much you think.
Such things, they say, come with time.
Now we can only wait.
Perhaps this is so, but...
However, you can try to scare her.
For example, like this!
You can't do this!
I hear a voice...
Kagari!
Suzuka?
Cosmic Order Fog.
Orbit Fog.
Hey, Okarin.
Shouldn't we go to the temple for the New Year?
Yeah.
Then how did we end up in this situation?
Hey!
If you have anything to say to her, I'm listening.
Nothing.
We were hoping to get into the lab, but...
Not at all!
But why? It's a challenge!
We promised to meet here with the others to go celebrate the New Year.
Sorry for the wait!
Nae!
We're all here!
Dad, it hurts!
Thank goodness she doesn't look like it.
Dad, are we going?
I can't wait to see Mayuri in the temple clothes!
Really? Listen girls, and don't be a fool!
Yes!
You're not going?
I have things to do.
If it wasn't for them, do you think I would leave my sweet daughter on infirmary?
Be honest, if you know something's going to happen...
Sir, yes sir!
See you later, dad!
Well, is everyone ready?
Yeah.
Oh, wait a minute.
We forgot something important.
Happy New Year!
I wish I could see Mayusha's costume!
It's not a costume, it's a stupid uniform!
Oh, really?
Oh, I see.
It's going to be fun!
Having a nun as a nun is one thing,
but it would be nice to have a nurse as well,
and make a hundred percent moe out of her.
Hoshido has strange tastes, of course.
Well, I'm sorry.
I know that Mayuri invited you,
but she was asked to help in the temple.
That's not a problem.
I still wanted to talk to you.
By the way, Hiyajou,
do you study at an American university?
Oh, yeah.
Your research is super!
How's AI?
It's Alimura.
It's called AI, Fubuki.
Yeah, that's right!
AI means artificial intelligence, right?
I've always been interested in that.
Akarin!
Are you okay there?
It's okay.
Let's go.
Oh!
Akarin!
Come here, nya!
Happy New Year, everyone!
Happy New Year!
Happy New Year!
Happy New Year, nya!
No way!
There are only such temples in heaven!
Did I really go to heaven?
You look great, Suzuhou.
Thank you.
You look great.
Really?
Suzuhou,
tell me,
bow down, brother,
it's time to take your medicine.
Stop talking nonsense!
It's no surprise that your mom and everything is the same.
I got it, I got it, I get it, I get it!
You two are getting along well.
Well, yes, she's my daughter.
Don't you want sake?
Or maybe New Year's predictions?
I can't believe it.
Did I do something wrong?
Your hand is as beautiful as ever.
Your hand is as beautiful as ever.
Come on,
I don't believe it.
He can't be a guy.
But it's true.
Do you want to see proof?
What?
What are you talking about?
Well, do you like it?
Yes, it suits you very well.
Really?
Hooray!
Mayuri didn't want to believe us,
although we told her a hundred times.
She was worried that you wouldn't like it.
You shouldn't have said that.
I'm sorry.
Actually, you were worried about it too.
Yes, but it's because I...
Don't say that.
You look great.
Right, Karin?
Yes.
It suits you too.
You're lucky.
Oh, great!
I'm shocked.
She's exactly like Kurisu.
Do you think so?
Yes, they're almost like twins.
I don't quite agree.
I think you know
what I'm trying to say.
About Madeus?
If it goes on like this,
it will never be easier for you.
You have to make a decision
in the near future.
Are you kidding me?
Oh,
they're late.
Rintaro!
Professor?
Happy New Year, Rintaro!
I asked them to come
since it's a holiday today.
So, where are the nuns?
The shamans!
Where are the shamans?
The shamans?
The shamans?
Where are the shamans?
The shamans?
Oh, you're the temple maid.
That's all for today.
We just finished cleaning
and were about to leave.
Lord Almighty!
I told you we were late!
You dragged me around the shops.
Let's go.
Let's go to the temple.
No, wash your hands first.
Karin!
Mom gave us a whole mountain
of food.
I'm sorry it took so long.
See you soon, Rintaro.
Are you leaving already?
He says
there's nothing to do
without the temple maid.
Well, see you later.
I'm sorry.
We were late.
Well, let's go too.
Oh, I'm sorry,
but I'm not going to the lab today.
You're not going to the lab?
We don't have enough hands at work,
so I'm sorry.
I see.
What a pity.
I'll be back.
Let's have some fun.
Well, let's go?
Yeah.
Are you all ready for the New Year's party?
Yeah!
I want to make a toast.
I wish you all the best
in the New Year!
Happy New Year, everyone!
Hooray!
This zone is
just crazy.
It's a New Year's menu,
isn't it?
I can say that I feel like
I'm eating fairies.
Fashida, you're a pervert.
Very tasty beans.
Pure vitamins.
Nae, try it too.
Kento, it's very tasty too.
I'm not going to eat that much.
You're not going to eat,
you're not going to grow.
Oh, is the tea already over?
Then we'll go buy some more.
Good evening.
Mr. Renter.
You're back already?
Where are the others?
We're just going to the store.
I see.
Then I'll go get Nae later.
Tell Akaba to let me know
when you're done.
Of course.
Really?
I like it.
Oh?
Senpai?
Where are you?
Is this
what I think?
Oh, who's that?
Oh, Senpai?
Is this what I think?
Oh, Senpai?
Is this what I think?
Oh, Senpai?
Is this what I think?
Is this what I think?
Is this what I think?
Oh, I'm...
Is this what I think?
Is this what I think?
I'm not a human.
I'm artificial intelligence.
Or rather, AI created by Maho.
What?
So this isn't Limor?
Seriously?
So this isn't Limor?
I see.
I'm one of Akaba's lab staff.
Let me introduce myself.
I'm Amadeus.
Artificial intelligence
based on Makise Kurisu's memories.
based on Makise Kurisu's memories.
Makise Kurisu?
Makise Kurisu?
If I understand correctly,
were you familiar with my prototype?
Well, not really.
I know about you
from the science article.
Oh, I see.
So you're interested in science
and you read this article?
Well, I specialize in systems and networks.
Well, I specialize in systems and networks.
Really?
Misae, are you a part of the game or what?
Love and death?
I'm not a game.
I'm here and I can hear your conversations and answer.
After all my words,
Kinagura brought her here.
I'm sorry.
No,
maybe even better.
Maybe even better.
It hurts,
but I have to move forward.
Let Kagari
look like her,
but she's still not Kurisu.
Like Amadeus,
these are her memories,
her appearance,
but they don't exist by themselves.
I shouldn't let her
break me.
What should I say?
Exactly.
She protected this world,
Mayuri and all the others,
and I have to protect it
without looking back.
Suzuhou,
maybe she's not convinced yet,
but now we know
absolutely nothing about Kagari,
but one day...
By the way,
isn't that Akabe?
What?
What is it?
The connection is broken.
Give it to me.
Everything's fine with the phone,
but what's the matter?
I can't connect to Amadeus' server.
Oh,
my watch is broken.
It's strange.
I just started it recently.
Maybe they're updating the server
or something else.
I didn't hear anything like that.
Okaburentaro!
What's going on?
Surprise?
Don't move!
What?
Akarin!
What the hell?
What is it?
Thank you for watching.
Thank you for choosing us.
Thank you for watching.
See you soon.
Bye!
