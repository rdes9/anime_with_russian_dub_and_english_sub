If you're here, then say something. If you stand like that, you'll scare someone.
Happy New Year to you.
It's just a greeting, isn't it? Or is it too late to congratulate me now?
Anyway, you're shocked. I've never seen you like this before.
You shouldn't start the year like that!
Happy New Year!
Happy New Year!
Happy New Year!
Happy New Year!
Sorry.
It's okay. It happens to me too sometimes.
You were thinking about her.
About Mayuri.
What?
She always reminds me when I'm here.
Do you hear the steps?
When the door opens, you're already waiting for her to come in and say hello.
Akabe?
Akabe?
Akabe?
Akabe?
Sorry about that.
No, it's okay. I shouldn't have said that.
If you think about it, you didn't show up here after Mayuri's death.
I see.
I haven't seen you since then.
Hoshida disappeared too, but he's not that bad.
Is that true? Is that the world's alpha line?
Where's the radio?
You broke it, didn't you?
You broke it, didn't you?
Did you forget?
Akabe?
I think I need some fresh air.
Okay.
Hold on.
The city and the people are exactly the same.
They're no different from yesterday.
But the world's alpha line has one thing.
No matter what I try to do in this reality in Mayuri,
I always die.
Akabe?
Akabe?
Akabe?
Akabe?
Akabe?
Right now they're taking her to a hospital.
It's probably a heart attack.
Even if we manage to get away from Serna's attack,
Mayuri should die on this world line.
That's why. That's why!
But still, why did I come back?
Why was the counting Steiner activated?
It's not D-Mail, and I didn't use the time machine!
Another earthquake in Russia.
Ocarin?
Daru?
You're not going to see Vakib very often now.
Welcome back!
Welcome back!
I'm back!
And today Ocarin came with me!
Okabe!
Rukaku?
Tyoma!
I missed you so much!
Tyoma!
I haven't been here for so long.
No, it's just...
For a while I couldn't come here either.
Nice to meet you, I'm Fubuki.
We were doing cosplay together with Mayuri, so she's dear to me.
Fubu-nya has been helping us since Mayusha left us.
It's hard, but I thought Mayuri would be happier this way.
This is our photo from the summer Kameema.
She made us such cute costumes that we didn't want to forget it.
She was as always clumsy, but everything was fine.
She was just with herself.
Fubu-nya, remember what I said?
Mayusha will be worried if you keep crying.
Ok?
Fubu-nya?
What if...
What if there is a world where Mayuri is alive?
What if you knew about him?
What?
Daru?
Okarin, let's go out.
Okabe...
What's wrong with you?
There are things that you can say and things that you can't.
A world where Mayusha is alive?
You're the only one who couldn't accept it, Okarin!
This echelon...
We broke it, but you stopped it yourself!
Did I just give up?
Yes.
You repeated it over and over again.
It was me who killed Mayusha.
It was me who made such a choice.
Why did you break the TV wave and the time machine?
If you knew that you would regret it, you would have left everything as it is.
Even Makisa told you.
Kurisu?
She said that there is a chance!
That we can try!
That there is something we can do!
VT TV store.
Hello?
This is Makisa.
Hashida.
Long time no see.
Happy New Year.
And you too.
I'm surprised.
You usually don't call me, Hashida.
I ran into Okarin.
I see.
He was in the lab, right?
Yes.
Did he say something?
Yes.
He hasn't let Mayusha go yet.
He asked if there was a world where Mayuri was alive.
And what then?
I got angry.
I couldn't believe that he said that after everything that happened.
You think...
I'm sorry.
Kurisu!
Did you know where I was?
Of course I did.
It's you, right?
That's what I'm talking about.
It's a joke.
GPS.
Do you have something like that?
You don't know that?
Akaba, are you...
...from another world line?
Duel of Antinomy, Antinomic Duel
Duel of Antinomy
The place where you're sitting now...
...Mayuri used to sit there.
The man who left her...
...would never go there again.
I think...
...he punished himself like that.
Besides...
...you didn't even know about GPS.
Right.
But what for?
I won't tell you.
Duel of Antinomy
This is...
I've remade it.
I'll call it a corrected TV wave.
No, it's a corrected TV wave.
You made it again?
For what?
To send a message to the past.
No.
To change the world lines.
Akaba, I want you to use it...
...and return to your reality.
What are you...
...going to?
To the place where Mayuri lives.
Most likely, you're from the world...
...where she was able to escape.
Can you see me through?
Of course.
I've been watching you for so long.
I mean, I didn't mean to say that.
It's true, but...
Anyway, you're Akaba Rintaro...
...from another world line.
There's nothing else to discuss.
Come back.
Change the world lines.
We can let Mayuri survive.
But...
...even this world turned out to be easy to change.
It changed without my participation.
It's true.
After all, I didn't do anything.
But still...
...why did it end like that?
After all, I...
You loved me, and I pretended you weren't there.
And now...
...now...
...you tell me to kill you again?
I...
...I can't do that.
Hoshido?
Where's Karin?
Where did you go?
After all...
We knew Akaba wouldn't forget Mayuri.
But Makisa...
No, it doesn't matter.
I'm sorry.
Have you made up your mind?
Of course not.
This train has just passed, right?
We'll meet at Akihabara station in an hour.
Why?
There's a place I want to show you.
It's hard to find you without a lab coat.
Where are we going?
You'll find out when we get there.
What?
Nothing.
We've never been on a train together.
Stop staring at me, or I'll call the police.
But I'm innocent.
The law says that even a look can be a sexual harassment.
Amadeus doesn't look like you.
Amadeus?
Yes.
Artificial intelligence.
How did you know that?
Did I tell you?
Through Hiyaji and Professor Leskinin.
What?
You know Maho?
What the hell is going on in your line?
Why are you so excited?
I'm calm.
Right after Amadeus' servers went down.
What could have happened to him?
I don't know.
But from a rational point of view,
I can't imagine that he could change the world line.
Coincidence?
Yes.
Amadeus has all my memories.
Which means that the time machine theory is the same.
What do you mean?
Theoretically, I denied their existence.
The time machine is impossible.
However, it doesn't mean that they are impossible at all.
Curisu.
Amadeus answered differently.
I hoped that Dad would look, so...
You stole my theory.
Akabe?
Everything is fine.
I can't believe that you became friends with Maho.
We met at the seminar.
Then you should know how rude and stubborn she can be.
And she's also clumsy.
That's what she is.
I understand that you were her evil assistant.
How rude?
I was a very polite assistant.
I always bought her drinks.
For example, jasmine tea.
The grave of the Yashin family.
The grave of the Yashin family.
The others also came.
After the death of the major, you were very depressed.
You stopped going to the lab and the university.
You were sitting here for days.
As if you were waiting for someone who would come and take you to heaven.
I couldn't do anything for you.
In the end, you did it for me.
Curisu.
But now everything will end.
Everything should end now.
At this pace, you will be killed by the feeling of guilt.
It's the same there.
Even if I return to the world line of the beta,
this feeling will not change.
So I sacrifice you and I ...
Take yourself in the hands of Aka Barentaro.
Don't make such a face.
If you are the Hoenkyo that I know,
then you must be strong and confident.
It's all just a game, a lie.
I did it to cheer up Mayuri.
You just wanted Mayuri to smile.
This is the most important thing.
And I feel the same.
Your decision was not a mistake.
There is only one mistake here.
This is the world line.
So go back to Aka Barentaro.
You were here because it was just a dream.
Go back to reality.
Dream?
Yes.
Let's go back to the laboratory.
Before you wake up, promise me one thing.
What?
When you come back, forget about me.
Impossible. I can't.
Do it, even if you can't.
I want it.
It's not about emotions.
It's about Madeus.
What?
I don't know why your world line changed this time.
But it's obvious that the time machine is involved.
Why are you so worried?
I can't influence your world line from here.
But in this one, I finished the time machine theory only after meeting you.
And I can't guarantee that it won't happen there.
It's too dangerous for you two to communicate too much.
This is our oath.
If you lie, I'll plug the electrode into your hippocampus.
This is our oath.
It was unworthy.
Shut up.
Send a message. Don't go inside.
Hey.
Do you remember how we met?
You grabbed me and pulled my clothes.
I thought you were some kind of a pervert.
I see.
She thinks this is our first meeting.
I...
Wait.
Everything is ready.
All that's left is to send a message and you'll go back to your world line.
Akabe.
Yes.
I'll send it and go back to my world line.
The world where I live.
The world where I don't lose it.
But instead of that, I'll lose it.
There's no more Kurisu.
I killed her.
My very, very favorite.

Akabe.
I feel the same.
I love you.
