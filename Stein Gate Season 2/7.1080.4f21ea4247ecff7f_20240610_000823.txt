What does it mean?
What does it mean?
Is it a game?
What the hell is going on?
Is it really...
Is it really you?
Is it really you?

Karin
No! Mayuri, help me! Kagari!
Don't! If you try!
Enough! Let me go!
Hey!
I told you not to make any noise!
Dad!
Mr. Brown!
Kagari!
Stop!
Stop!
Dad!
Everything's fine, Naya. Dad's next to you now.
It's from you, Capo. I'm waiting for an explanation.
What kind of people were they?
It's complicated.
We're back!
We bought all kinds of soda.
What's going on? Are you all scared?
What about the TV?
Watch out! Don't step on it!
Where's the broom and the broomstick?
Vibron transition. Transition process.
Looks like Mayuri and the others got home without an accident.
Maha wrote that she's in the office.
And she's staying there for the night just in case.
I see. I'm glad to hear that.
Listen, Karin.
Those people came for Kagari, didn't they?
Yes.
You know what I think?
Most likely, they knew that Kagari was from the future.
And, probably, before she lost her memory, something happened to her.
It looks like it.
Raunderne Serne.
This organization used to take us hostage in order to create a time machine.
Wait.
Even if it's another world line, Tennoji still has to manage Serne's business in Akihabara.
But if he's our enemy, why would he help us?
So, the man in the motorcycle helmet wasn't Kiryu Maeko.
But who is it?
I don't know.
Armed robbery? In Japan? In Akihabara?
It's almost like in Suzuha's fairy tales.
I'm so lucky that everyone has jumped out of the corner and shouted,
Yeah, you did it!
You know what I'm talking about, don't you?
I know how it feels.
But the truth is, I don't know how it feels.
I don't know how it feels.
I know how it feels.
But the truth is, it's not a game.
I know it, I remember it.
I can't count how many times I've been through it.
The smell of gunpowder, the screams, the blood.
So what?
Sorry.
Do you want to take a break?
No.
Maybe it's him?
The choice of Wartstein?
Or something like that?
Wartstein, yeah.
It doesn't sound right.
Wait.
You're barely standing on your feet.
Look at me.
I'm fine.
You're not fine.
Hey, do you think it's going to happen again?
Something like today's.
We need to come up with a way to prevent it.
It's impossible to establish a connection.
The number you've dialed is not available or is not being serviced.
What's going on?
Where did the professor go?
I still can't connect to Madaus.
What the hell is going on?
Hello?
Suzuka, it's me.
What's going on?
The security system is much better than I expected.
It's not safe.
It's not safe.
It's not safe.
It's not safe.
It's not safe.
It's not safe.
It's not safe.
It's not safe.
It's not safe.
It's not safe.
The security system is much better than I expected to see in the temple.
Maybe the father's hands are paranoid.
This system has been around for more than a year.
Once they had time to climb to them at night.
Even if so, it's not a coincidence?
Well, maybe they asked Karina to help.
And I maybe hid a couple of three-bedroom rooms.
In any case, I think with such a system we can sleep peacefully.
Okay.
If anything happens, call me right away.
Okay.
You be more careful too, dad.
You're much weaker than me.
And that's it?
It's better to say that dad is a damaged fat man who can't even ...
Oh, welcome back.
How's Kagari?
It must be scary and scary.
Just fell asleep.
I see.
Uncle Ruka, you must be tired too.
Go get some rest.
The security system is fine, so don't worry.
Suzuko, are you going to lie down?
I'm fine.
If anything happens, I'll be able to react immediately.
Seriously?
You're not going to rest at all.
It's okay. I'm used to it.
Mom.
Mom.
Don't leave me.
Mom.
El Psy Kongroo.
Listen, can I ask you something?
What is it?
Well, why do you address Uncle Okabe when you talk about Kabe?
Why do you sometimes call Mayuri Auntie Mayu?
And Faeris?
Faeris, you call Auntie Rumi?
And me?
You even call me Uncle Ruka?
Kagari just said the word Mom.
But right before she fell asleep, she said her name.
Mom Mayuri.
She's talking about our Mayuri, isn't she?
Why did she call her Mom?
You'd better not know.
It's you again.
Nobody wants to tell me anything.
Okabe and Mayuri are always so sad.
Hoshida and Faeris are all hiding something from me.
I know it's no good for me, but even if it is, I also want to share their worries with them.
Uncle Ruka.
Please, you couldn't tell me.
It's Uncle Okarin's business.
You're the only one he doesn't want to talk to.
And I think I understand why.
Why?
He wants at least someone to stay a part of this world.
He wants you to know the world only as it is now.
I think Uncle Okarin is saving this thought.
Saving?
Yes.
And what?
What should I answer to that?
You should go to sleep.
Good night.
Happy New Year.
The store has been open since January 3rd.
You finally showed up.
So?
And what was it yesterday?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I'll do it.
If I'm right, it should work.
So what?
You don't want to explain?
First of all, I'd like to know one thing.
You didn't do it, did you?
What do you mean?
Why would I do it?
Don't you get it?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
If you don't get it, I'll give you a higher rent.
I say that because you're a rounder, Mr. Ferdinand Brown.
Or should I call you FB?
What is it, Dad?
You have a scary face.
Really?
It seems to be always like that.
You know, go for a walk.
Or better watch an anime, okay?
And put on headphones, please.
Can I?
Hooray!
I knew it.
You don't want to talk to her.
The woman in the motorcycle suit that attacked us.
It wasn't your subordinate, Kiryu Maeko.
They weren't rounders at all.
But...
What can you tell me?
If I ask for evidence.
Even if I tell you, you won't believe me.
Come on, tell me.
I see that you were ready for this conversation.
Yes?
Why didn't you tell the police?
Well, Karin said to postpone it.
Seriously?
And they had weapons?
They had weapons?
In any case, he asked us to talk to him.
Are you in the lab?
Not a single moron will enter the house twice, said Hoshido.
Just...
I would also like to go with you.
And what's wrong with your hand?
Oh, I tripped yesterday and fell.
A time machine and a world line?
It's not easy to believe in that.
As I said.
You said it, but...
You're right about me.
Your words are mostly true.
I didn't even realize it.
I also know that the CERN data is completely classified.
Regardless of the success of the mission,
they eliminate everyone who knows their secrets.
You know that? In that case...
But that has nothing to do with your mission!
You didn't let the information leak!
I just knew everything from the very beginning.
So you shouldn't be punished for this.
How convenient.
Well, the truth is yours.
I didn't receive any messages from CERN.
There will be no problem until you keep quiet that I'm a Raunder.
Well, why did you come?
You told me all this for a reason, didn't you?
I have a request.
Shina Kagari.
I want you to protect her from them.
Who and why is pursuing this girl?
I don't know.
Then the conversation is over.
You didn't come here and...
You can't do that!
If yesterday repeats itself,
what will happen to your daughter?
She can also suffer.
You bastard, you decided to blackmail me with your daughter?
I'll kill you.
I propose to cooperate.
Alone.
Even you will have a hard time protecting Naya.
Well, I'm helping you, but I'm taking more risks.
Maybe.
But that has its advantages.
Oh, you.
You came.
If you allow us to work with Kagari here,
you will have less work.
And it seems to me that it's easier to work with you.
Then Naya and I...
You were both witnesses to yesterday's attack.
I don't want to upset you,
but I think you understand everything yourself.
Dad.
I don't know what happened,
but yesterday I was very scared.
Navi.
But...
The thought scares me even more.
That something can happen to you.
So I'm calmer when Aunt Suzuka and the others are here.
Navi.
To let you know,
there will be a salary.
One for two.
I'm not rich for you.
Daddy.
Skryaga.
If you don't like something,
I can increase the salary.
If you don't like something,
I can increase the salary.
No, thank you very much, Mr. Tanoji.
That's how it is.
You'd better find out who these people are.
Otherwise we won't be able to do anything.
I understand.
So you think Kagari was involved in the crime
before she lost her memory?
Yes.
Then why don't you go to the police?
Well, you see...
The thing is that she's afraid of the police.
Who knows?
Maybe the police are connected to this gang.
I can't believe it.
In any case,
they only need Kagari.
That is,
you all better stay away from this place for now.
What?
Come on!
But what about Kagari?
If they hunt for her,
she has guards.
Two reliable defenders.
If you please, Mr. Brown,
then I'm calm.
But we have our own task.
We know who they are and what they want.
Aha!
Your humble servant is in business.
The police officers promised me to keep an eye on them.
So we'll find out if something happens.
Can I help you?
Kagari is in trouble,
I'm sitting here
and I can't do anything.
Mayusha would also like to help.
Rukako,
Kagari has already found a shelter for you,
and you, Mayuri,
have already helped us a lot.
That's enough.
Maybe we could help too.
K6205
What is it?
Tennoji says...
Another earthquake in Russia.
Now I remember
that they said something strange.
Strange?
How was it?
Yes,
K6205 or something like that.
Apparently,
it's some kind of signal code.
Signal code?
For the military.
They use it in the West.
Solid goods articles.
Check Kyuchil's catalogue.
What's that?
It's a numbered list
of all Mozart's works.
But there are less than 6,000 of them,
so there can hardly be any connection.
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.
Maybe it's not a whole number,
but a fifth part of the K6205?
K6205?
It's like a magic flick.
Wow, you're right.
It's known for its mystery
and Masonic symbolism.
Amadeus?
What's the matter then?
I can't connect to Amadeus's server.
Ocarin!
Hiyachi here.
Hello, it's me.
Okabe?
What's going on?
No, I need to ask.
Come on, quickly.
I'm a little busy here.
Did Amadeus's servers work?
No.
No access.
I don't want to think that way,
but maybe someone broke them.
So, we'll talk later.
I'll hang up.
Ocarin!
Amadeus, this is the incoming call.
Amadeus?
Kurisu?
Please, save me.
Okabe!
Steiner!

What do you choose for us?

Amadeus is gone. The world line has changed. It's changed again.
Is there someone there? Dara? Mayuri?
Kurisu?
Amadeus is gone.
