Long Story short
I remember thinking that I would love to know what you really wanted to do
And with his younger self I first ever got the energy to build my future
That was a long time ago
Berat Oishteyn, zero
It turns out that no matter how many times you return, the time machine is still destroyed.
Yes.
Can't you hurry up and get into the radio building earlier to prevent a jump?
Of course. And then we'll save Mayuri and Suzuku. However, this can lead to unexpected consequences.
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
I don't know if the time machine is destroyed because of the convergence action or not.
Although this moment is definitely considered the beginning of the Third World War. So it's possible.
Where are you going?
I need to freshen up and think.
Akarin, you jumped over and over again to get here, right?
Yes.
Then what kind of future attracts you? What do you feel now? Don't you want to wonder, as usual?
Wonder?
I always believed that he would come back.
I decided never to give up. But when it comes to this...
Take yourself into your own hands.
What about Kaburentaro?
Kurisu. Exactly. The professor still hasn't hidden it.
Didn't you see the future? And didn't you come back to the world?
You're a scientist. And if the chance is not equal to zero, it means it's too early to give up.
I'll support you in everything.
What's funny?
Nothing. Just how lazy I am not to change the laboratory staff.
I don't know how to change the lab staff.
What's funny?
Nothing. Just how lazy I am not to change the lab staff.
They never change.
Idiot. All this to make the organization lose track of me.
Assistant number one and number two.
Assistant?
We need to start the meeting.
Follow me.
What was that just now?
I don't know.
Hurry up, children who are in love with experiments.
What?
In other words, there are two main factors that will be the cause of the war.
America and Russia. Plus...
Time Machine.
You've already said that.
Stratford and Laskinen are to blame for this organization.
And one more American, DARPA.
Besides, Russian intelligence.
It turns out three organizations.
It doesn't seem to be true.
Like the organization you're always talking about.
Exactly.
So it turned out that I'm a genius.
I've known for a long time what countries are plunging our world into chaos.
And they started to act.
Senpai.
What?
K.B. hurt his head recently?
Or was he injured?
Shut up, Christina!
Don't add to him!
Aren't you ashamed to behave like that?
And you think I'm not ashamed?
How can it not be embarrassing at all?
I think it's cool.
And Karin, whom I know, is unpleasant and terribly annoying.
He makes arguments for any word and consists of strangeness to the bone.
But it is precisely because of this that his absurd logic can overcome the impossible.
Beru.
Now explain why you came out so gloomy,
and returned with a wave of full enthusiasm.
What happened?
What were you doing?
Karin!
Kissed?
Kissed!
You don't have my ears!
I envy you!
There's nothing between us.
And besides, Daru, you forgot one very important thing.
What?
I'm not K.B. Rintaro.
My name is...
Ho!
Oh!
In!
Come on!
Look!
This is the true form of a mad scientist!
Open your eyes and see my greatness!
Is he all right?
It's me.
Soon the final stage of the plan will begin.
When it all starts, no one in the world will have a chance.
Yes.
Yes, I know.
Who is he talking to?
Enough already.
Hurry up and let's get this over with.
You should have said that right away.
Loligaru!
As I said, there are three organizations that need a machine.
All previous failures were caused by the interference of these organizations.
However, this does not mean that they will not cope with them.
So the time machine can be destroyed not because of the influence of the convergence?
In fact, we will allow them to get into the car.
But it is at the moment of their return to the past that we cannot allow interference.
We can.
We can interfere with Stratfor and Leskin.
And we managed to interfere with Darpy and her soldiers.
That means...
Only the Russians are left.
Do you have any plans?
No.
What?
You talked for so long, but you didn't come up with anything.
Yes, yes, complete nonsense.
What is it?
Shut up!
I managed to break Leskin and Darpa's plans only thanks to my exceptional, very brilliant plan.
What did you do?
You can't come up with a plan on your own, can you?
I can't tell you anything.
That's how it is.
Now it is best to understand why this is happening.
It is important to find out their purpose and establish a cause-and-effect connection.
In our case, Russia...
Russia...
Here it is!
The pose that everyone was waiting for!
Who is it?
There is no choice.
Here.
Write.
First of all, how did the American and Russian organizations find out that we have a time machine?
The Americans could tell Leskin.
In the future, Leskin used Kagari to tell Leskin about the real time machine.
But Kagari should have met the professor many years ago.
Why didn't he act earlier?
Nothing can be changed.
What?
It's like a time paradox.
If actions interfere with history, the convergence of the world line will lead to their effect to a minimum.
World line?
However, Leskin was going to use it in his own interests.
Then it is clear.
In fact, in the future, July 7, 2011, the conflict over the time machine was turned into a war.
On July 7, the time machine was destroyed.
So he thought he could steal it on that day.
How did DARPA find out all the information?
The country is the same.
But if you think about Russia...
They stole information from the Americans?
If the professor heard about the Third World War from his future self...
I'm sure the information was well guarded.
They want Russia to know more than others.
Daru, you have to find something.
No problem, but what?
Find information about Dr. Nakabachi.
I was at the hair salon.
If the detector didn't react to this...
Exactly, exactly.
Dr. Nakabachi ran to Russia.
Dad...
Dad?
We'll talk about it later.
Dr. Nakabachi stole the time machine theory and fled with it to Russia.
Well, Russia doesn't have its own time machine.
Why?
If it were, the conflict would not have arisen.
When we were attacked six months ago, Kurisu's laptop was destroyed by the Russians.
They found a connection between Dr. Nakabachi's and Kurisu's theories.
And they couldn't afford for someone else to get the information.
Is there anything else left of her work that we don't know about?
Her notes, her information...
Well, I guess so.
Inside me are all the memories of Makise Kurisu.
And we have one way of thinking.
If someone invents a time machine, they may need me.
That time when Amadeus was captured, the world line changed.
What happened?
If we go back to the Russian interference, is it possible to protect Amadeus?
But when exactly did they interfere?
I don't know for sure.
It should be as early as possible.
When was the first time you took Kurisu's data?
Her departure to Japan.
Somewhere in the spring of last year.
If I go back there...
Is it possible? She wasn't there last spring.
To begin with, your interruption wasn't finished until last summer.
In any case, don't jump so far.
Then I'll give you a demail.
Are you sure? You've always been against this idea.
Exactly. Otherwise Cern will catch us.
So...
We'll have to find another way, right?
I'm sorry I didn't mention it earlier, but I want to say something.
Where is Ryan?
Yes.
Using the demail principles, you can send an SMS to the past via Ryan.
And Cern didn't notice that?
Uh-huh.
The thing is that Ryan was in the beta version last spring.
And I was the only one who installed it.
I think the last New Year is our limit.
So we'll only be able to contact Hashida.
Will it work?
Maybe.
You'll get a message from your future self asking you to protect Amadeus' data.
If I know you, you'll do it.
But if you see it, you'll get angry right away.
Wait!
That won't be enough to stop the leak of information.
You're going against the country.
They'll come after them while there's a chance.
Maybe they'll copy and spread the data.
That's right.
Then what do we do?
Destroy it.
You have to get access to the data right after the backup.
And destroy the system.
Then it won't be restored.
It's the only way, Senpai.
If we destroy everything in the spring of last year,
there won't be a way to restore Amadeus.
But that means you...
So Amadeus won't be created?
Episode 22.
Renaissance Projection.
Project Amadeus.
What's going on?
There's no point in asking me.
At this pace, the time machine will destroy it again tomorrow.
It seems likely.
Then isn't it obvious what needs to be done?
It is, but I think I understand it.
And I'm sure you do too.
I think Okabe...
What?
What is it?
I'm just sending a message.
Amadeus wants to talk to you.
Hello.
Hello.
It seems I haven't been outside for a long time.
Can you show me?
Not really, I need to talk.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Wow, that's great.
I've never seen a night before.
Do you have to ask?
If I had legs, I'd walk as much as I want.
But I'm a program.
If you really don't want to erase me,
then it shows the scale of Amadeus as a program.
It affects someone's heart.
So I'm comparable to a person.
You'll disappear.
I knew you were stuck on that.
If we're already outside,
can you show me something else?
Everything looks different at night.
That's for sure.
Do other areas look like this?
No, it all depends on the place.
Shinzuku and Shibuya are lively even at night.
But in Ginza, it's probably quieter than here.
Really?
Do you think so?
Where to now?
Let's see.
Take me upstairs.
Okay.
Do you remember how we walked before?
Yes.
By the way, what happened to your funny voice?
Ha-ha-ha and all that.
Did you like it?
Yes, assistant?
Of course not.
I just wanted to laugh at you.
It's a cozy place.
Do you like it?
Very much.
Everything is so messy.
There are no rules here.
The world I live in has a cause and a purpose for everything.
Useless data is erased.
Waste is cleaned to make work more efficient.
But the world I see now can be called chaotic.
It's full of useless things.
And wasteful actions happen every day.
You can know the right choice, but do the wrong thing.
But it gives a chance.
It gives meaning to the unnecessary.
Everything is mixed and wonderful things happen because of it.
Accidental meetings.
A program like me can't even try such a life.
Kurisu.
Akabarintaro.
I can understand your feelings and don't want to erase me.
To be honest, it makes me happy.
Then...
But you talked about the world line of Wradstein.
Shino, my Yuri is alive.
Besides, life is not original to me.
The world line where both can live right in front of you.
I already said, but I'm no more than a program.
Even if you...
I understand.
Then why?
I...
Then...
I killed the real you.
What?
In that situation, I could save either my Yuri or Kurisu.
I chose my Yuri.
And then I stopped trying to save you.
Did I agree with that?
Yes.
You repeated again and again that everything is right.
That choosing my Yuri is the right option.
I can believe.
My pride will not be sacrificed for me.
You know what to do, don't you?
Save Shino and Suzuhou, but don't let the war begin.
But then you...
But...
As if you never existed.
You can't just disappear.
No one will even remember your existence.
But you'll remember me, won't you?
What if I fail?
What if I can't?
Didn't you think so before?
But you regretted it and decided to make 3,000 jumps to fix everything.
Since the moment I died, I always asked myself...
What is my existence?
What purpose do I exist for?
Although now I am very happy to realize that my existence became the cause of the new war.
Am I only there for this?
But if I can save the original Kurisu,
if it's for the sake of such a beautiful world,
if this is the reason for my creation,
it doesn't seem more logical and even romantic.
Kurisu...
Show me the sky.
It's so clear.
Yes.
You all live in a more beautiful world than you think.
Over time, chaos and randomness create miracles
and create confidence in this world.
Right?
I finished setting up.
Are you ready, Senpai?
Are you sure?
Yes.
Good.
Now we have everything left.
Let it be.
I'm sure.
I'm sure.
I'm sure.
I'm sure.
I'm sure.
Good.
Now we have everything left.
Let it be.
I'm sure.
I'm sure.
Amadeus, get ready to enter the control code.
Der Alte Wörfeld Nicht.
The control code has been entered.
Switching the system to emergency mode.
Execute the Maho Hiyajou command.
High-level administrator.
Transfer the selected patch to the specified file.
Change it to start processing after the system is reset.
Command confirmed.
Executing the Maho Hiyajou command.
High-level administrator.
Hiyajou...
Senpai!
Try your best and don't give up.
The possibilities are limitless.
I know you better than anyone.
That's why I'll say with confidence.
You will quickly surpass my research.
And you will achieve what I did not dream of.
And one day we will achieve the world we should be in.
I know we can do it.
We will get to it.
Amadeus, I swear.
The day when time will cross.
Without a doubt, we will get to this world.
And we will definitely meet.
Senpai, take care of Houen Yomei for me.
Kurisu!
Come on!
Come on!
To be continued...
