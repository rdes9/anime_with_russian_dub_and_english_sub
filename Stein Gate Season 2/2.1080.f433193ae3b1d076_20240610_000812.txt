We'd like to demonstrate this artificial intelligence.
Amadeus, the Makise-Korisu theory has been a starting point for the creation of this system.
Attention to the screen.
Excuse me, the system will take some time to launch.
Please wait.
What? Is it broken?
Is it possible to store memories of a person in a binary code?
How do you think they took samples?
From a medical point of view, this is some kind of nonsense.
It is impossible to rewrite data in a digital form back into the brain.
This is complete absurd.
I read your article in the science magazine, but I do not believe a single word.
Moreover, the leading author of this article is a 17-year-old girl.
Hey, you!
I protest!
How do you know it's impossible if you haven't tried it?
Around us, at every step, inventions that seemed unimaginable to people.
This is the merit of scientists who were not afraid to go beyond the possible.
Your criticism is unreasonable and inappropriate.
Excellent!
To re-wonderful, as a scientist like him, we are obliged to make constant progress.
Perhaps there are riddles in it for the new Einstein.
However, scientists must strive for indifference.
Screaming is only worth it after a successful experiment.
Thank you for waiting.
Translating the words of a girl who is stronger than me in oral translation.
Ladies and gentlemen, nice to meet you.
My name is Hiyajimaho.
To be exact, 78 hours and 22 minutes ago, I was created in her image and likeness.
Speaking the scientific language, I exist due to the memories of Hiyajimaho from time to time.
I heard from the bag in the fifth row.
Yes, you, in the red shirt.
Let me guess what you think.
If I was programmed in advance, then there is nothing surprising in my words and behavior.
Or maybe that girl in the scene is somehow controlling me.
But most of you think the following.
It is impossible to store human memory in the form of digital information.
But in this case, the question is what am I?
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thanks.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Amadeus
When I stopped going to the shower with my dad,
did you hear about Harassment?
And no, I won't tell you what pajamas I was wearing last week.
I don't remember.
And who can communicate like that?
And besides, he has emotional reactions
and forgets insignificant information.
He's like...
Oh, Einstein!
So, Amadeus, what did you think?
Uh...
Uh...
Sorry!
I don't like such things.
You're the guy with the information stand.
You're like...
I'm Okabe Rintaro.
Miyuki Yajou, right?
That's a strange name, isn't it?
But you're quite often in the cinema.
Um, you're...
I took the evening dress.
Or rather, I was going to.
I apologize for what happened.
What?
I mean, I interrupted your speech.
Don't worry.
If you didn't interfere,
everything could have ended much worse.
And by the way, you can behave less formally.
Well, as you say.
Your seminar was super.
To bring it to such perfection is something.
Thank you.
I'd like to say, but...
Unfortunately, we have a long way to go.
Really?
We have a lot of problems.
For example, let's take the memory of someone else.
It's useless if the brain can't use it.
When people try to remember something,
the signal comes from the frontal to the temporal part.
The descending impulses of memory.
Did you know about them?
So that the transmitted signals could be used in the temporal part.
And then, by sending a copy of the pseudo-impulse to the frontal part...
The impulse of memory performs its function.
Isn't that right?
Tell me, did you come up with these conclusions yourself?
What do you mean?
One of my colleagues came up with the exact same theory.
But the thing is, she didn't publish it anywhere.
Did you come up with the same results as she did,
even though she wasn't a neurologist?
By chance?
No.
All this...
Once she told me about Kurisu.
Kurisu?
When?
Where?
When she came here in exchange.
We became friends and talked about such things.
So you're friends with her?
Yes.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you right away.
No.
I'm very grateful to you for being her friend.
Although we only did what we were told to do.
She looks like her.
She never admitted defeat.
Yes.
And she argued for the sake of the argument.
Sometimes she even threatened to rip out my smile.
That's right.
Yes.
You should be more strict with your young colleagues.
I admit my fault.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
It's strange to cry over nothing.
No.
You were close.
Not that we were very close.
But...
But what?
I know.
Oh, Maho.
So this is where you were.
Oh, this is our Einstein.
I'm glad you came to the party.
Is this some kind of Japanese fight between your favorites?
Give her a real Japanese package.
No, I'm just...
You're not that kind of person.
You're not that kind of person.
You're not that kind of person.
Do you know the Japanese package?
No, I'm just...
Don't you get it?
I cried myself.
We were talking about Kurisu.
I...
Kurisu?
So you're saying you knew Kurisu?
Yes.
I see.
So you met her in Japan?
I'm Okabe Rintaro, a student at the DENKI University.
You said you were going to protect Kurisu's job, didn't you?
No, I just...
Well, yeah.
Probably partly because of that.
Well, if that's the case...
Macho.
Don't you think we should introduce Mr. Akaba to our friend?
To her.
To her?
Professor!
But he's a stranger, he's just a student!
If he was friends with Kurisu, it's unlikely he was a stranger.
It's a great fortune that they met here.
Wait, I don't understand something.
Introduce me to whom?
It's not a person.
He means Amadeus.
With your presentation?
That Amadeus used my memories, but there are others.
We also have the memory of another researcher.
Another?
Her!
Amadeus's forgotten Byakon,
but there are some otherotomies in поitopi!
To Evaka South Gate.
Amadeus has stocked his memory of Kurisu?
So far only Macho and I came,
It's better to think it over.
I don't know what happened to Coris, but...
The closer you get to her, the harder it will be for you to meet Samadeus.
A memory of her from eight months ago.
Hi!
Neurology Institute
We are planning to open a research center,
gathering neurologists from all over the world.
But nothing is ready yet.
Professor?
Today is Sunday. He's not here.
You said you wanted this. Are you sure?
You were closer than I thought.
Samadeus will talk and be as accurate as she is.
So it's easy to forget.
As if you're telling the truth to her, and she's still alive.
However, Samadeus was created according to the memories taken from her in March.
She's not the one you befriended, and she's not alive.
Such facts, let them be painful.
Yes.
The closer you get to her, the harder it will be for you to meet Samadeus.
As if you're telling the truth to her, and she's still alive.
I know.
I came to make amends.
I see.
Come in and sit down.
Don't look up the password.
Sit down.
What's wrong?
Well, I came in so far and now I'm scared.
It's not too late. Run as long as you can.
You're cruel.
I'm worried about you.
You're cruel.
I'm worried about you.
In this case, it would be easier to express yourself.
You're like a chicken, you're in love with the science of girls and all that.
Oh, sorry.
People who spend all their time in the lab forget how to be polite.
I think it sounds like an insult.
I'll make you pay for the slander.
I'm sorry.
Dr. Pepper is with me.
They'll go.
What's funny?
Learn.
She was right there.
Right in front of me.
Her voice.
Her look.
Go.
Okaburentaro?
Nice to meet you.
I'm Makise Kurisu.
Nice to meet you.
Episode 2.
The closed-circle epigraph.
This is Okaburentaro.
We met after the seminar the other day.
He was very interested in Lomodeus, so we invited him.
Yeah?
Since you're here, I'm glad to meet you.
Yes.
Since you invited him, he must be someone special.
Okabe...
You're also doing neurology?
He has a different specialty.
But he's definitely talented.
Even the professor liked him.
Excuse me, teacher.
Could you step closer to the speaker?
Please, just a second.
What?
Maybe you...
What?
That's not funny.
There's no need to be shy.
In any case, stop whining.
What did she say?
None of your business.
Not mine.
Don't talk nonsense, got it?
We didn't invite Okabe to talk about such nonsense.
The more you deny, the more suspicious.
I'll pump you with viruses.
I'm kidding.
No more words.
Damn.
That's one of the difficulties with Lomodeus.
I'm sorry.
Well, talk to her if you want.
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
Ask me anything or everything at once.
I'll answer everything I can.
Then...
Time machine.
Do you think it can be created?
Time machine, you say?
Yeah.
What do you mean?
Why are you asking about a time machine?
It's a thought experiment.
I don't even know.
Personally, I think it's impossible to create a time machine.
But I don't want to say it's impossible at all.
I think it's a time machine.
You don't think it's all nonsense?
It would be too hasty a conclusion.
There are several theories of time travel.
But all this speculation, they're all unrealistic.
Maybe we don't have enough of the only discovery that would connect everything together.
Don't you think?
So they're impossible now.
But theoretically possible.
Well?
The answer is a little different from what she gave then.
Maybe it's about the difference between the world lines of alphabets.
Rintaro!
Hey, boy! What's up?
I'm fine, thank you. And you?
That's a terrible pronunciation.
Shut up, Christina!
Christina?
Nothing. Just forget it.
I'm curious.
Yeah, it's okay. Forget it already.
You're obviously worried about something, Christina.
Stop it, Christina. I mean, Kurisu.
Why are you calling her Christina?
Couldn't you not stand behind her?
Please answer.
That's enough!
I'm curious too.
The model is an impressive thing, huh, Rintaro?
Tester?
Yeah.
You'll be talking to the model sometimes.
Maybe we'll get some new information.
You can talk to her until I get back to America.
The only request is to bring the report twice a month.
I need reports.
Don't worry about any bans and restrictions.
Talk to her whenever you want.
And honestly, write what you think about it.
Kurisu...
If you're not ready, don't be shy to refuse.
I understand that it's hard to communicate with artificial intelligence
that looks like your dead friend in every way.
Yeah.
Are you sure about that?
It all comes down to the fact that we won't have anything to talk to her about.
And besides, it's interesting to find out how the model will change
by talking to someone from abroad.
I knew it was going to happen.
Really?
Yeah.
As soon as I found out that he was a friend of Kurisu's.
I hope we'll meet again.
Bye, Rintaro.
He knows Kurisu the way I don't.
Teacher?
Teacher!
Kurisu!
Kurisu!
Kurisu!
Teacher!
Do you need any help?
No, I can do it myself.
You don't look like it.
Here.
Teacher?
Teacher, you need to learn to speak the language.
Why?
What if he hates you?
I asked you not to raise this topic.
What if this is your last chance at life?
You need to learn manners.
Plans?
Yeah.
Daru and I came up with a plan to cheer Suzu up.
What were you thinking about?
To be honest, Mayusha is a little scared of Suzu,
but she's a good person.
When Mayusha falls asleep, she sneaks up on me and covers me with a blanket.
And she always helps me with my hands and everything else.
Are you okay?
That's why we want to hold a big Christmas party for Suzu as a Christmas present.
A party?
You won't come?
I can, but I'm afraid Suzu won't be happy.
I'm even sure she'll be upset.
I don't think so.
Suzu also wants to make up with you.
I'm sure of it.
I'm sorry.
Take the phone.
Mayusha is waiting for you.
I'm sorry.
Did you really want to answer for the ninth time?
You know...
If you don't want to talk, I won't force you.
You know, I thought if you were a tester, I'd be able to talk to people more.
Yes.
Her mood swings and the dust.
Living curiosity and a desire to step back.
Why are you silent?
Okay, call me if you want.
But I have things to do, too.
I don't promise I'll answer.
I'm sure it's...
...Mahise...
...Kurisu.
