        <pre>Sister, where have you been?
Suzu...
Dad and the others are looking for you.
They say they're going to start the operation soon.
Sister...
Suzu...
Dad and the others are looking for you.
They say they're going to start the operation soon.
Sister...
Suzu...
Dad and the others are looking for you.
Sister...
What if...
What if then...
If I had this lesson...
Would this future be changed?
Then...
If my Hikoboshi came back to life...
It could change everything.
What if then...
If I had this lesson?
Hikoboshi
You're going through your past.
Deeper.
But even deeper you see the light.
What color is this light?
Red.
There's someone important to you in this world.
Is it someone from your family?
No.
Then a friend or maybe a lover?
We're not even friends.
We're... with her.
Oh! Okarin!
What?
I told you not to wait for me.
How did it go?
Well...
There's nothing special in hypnotherapy.
They said I'll be fine.
Really?
Yes.
But I still have to consult.
Mayuri, you were right.
I'm glad I tried.
Thank God.
Lately you didn't look very good.
I'm sorry to bother you.
It's ok.
Would you like something to eat?
I'll treat you to something.
In that case...
Maybe we should take a look at Vakib?
Ruko and Ferris called me a long time ago.
So it's Akihabara?
No.
Ok. Let's go.
Ok.
I'll tell them we'll come.
Ferris, you know what?
Yes.
It's already December.
It's autumn.
It's over quickly.
Anilibria.tv presents...
Brat Steiner
They said they'll be somewhere around here.
Ruko, Ferris!
Hi, Mayuri!
Oh, Kyouma!
Long time no see, Rukaka, Ferris.
Okabe-san!
Kyouma!
I missed you!
Stop it!
What's wrong with me?
Kyouma and Ferris are friends!
First of all, stop calling me Kyouma.
Why?
It's a dark past.
The one that's kept in secret by the cults of medieval mages?
Not at all.
You're overreacting.
I go to the lab sometimes, but you're never there.
I was very busy.
Don't tell me you're part of a secret organization?
No, I'm dirty in seminars.
Meow!
Yes, and in the club.
Meow-meow!
Okabe-san is in the club?
Are you a part of a secret organization?
No, I'm in a tennis club.
What?
My teacher recommended me to join a tennis club.
So, Kyouma is in a tennis club.
Our goal is Wimbledon.
So, you're so busy with your trainings?
No, my trainings aren't like that.
Then what are you doing?
You know, group dates.
Group dates?
What?
Okabe is going to a group date?
How are you, Mom?
It hurts.
It's a shame.
It's just disgusting.
What did you find?
Don't be so harsh.
I'm an ordinary student, you know.
Disgraceful! Disgraceful!
Kyouma, explain!
How could you, Okabe-san?
A message from Yuki.
Did something happen?
No.
She said that if I was at the club, she wanted to meet and show something.
In the lab.
It's ok.
Let's go.
This is an announcement of war.
Start trolling!
Normal fags should die.
Pinia was our comrade.
All this time she's been married to Portenon.
Liar!
Dad!
Wow!
The dog of the channel is already covered with fire!
I missed the move.
How did this happen?
Damn!
Listen to me.
Susuha, stop it.
Dad will get angry.
I'm already angry at you.
I'm sorry.
Here you are.
You've been playing games all day long.
But it's not easy to develop a time machine.
Besides, we already have one.
But you don't let her touch it.
That's because you're going to invent her in the future.
If you see her structure now, it can cause a paradox.
What difference does it make if it's known that I'm going to make it?
Then you can relax.
I'm telling you, it's time to take things seriously.
In the future, I'll be constantly angry at you for this.
Her anger would be a reward for me.
Dad!
Yes, I didn't say anything.
In the future, you always said that this world is the worst of all.
But my birth was the best event in it.
I came here to convince Uncle Karina that we could at least somehow change this future.
But he hasn't been here since that day.
Someone's coming.
What? Is it Karina?
No. The sound of footsteps.
It's Mom!
Susu, hide!
Okidoki!
Yes, come in.
Hi.
Amane-si, what brought you here?
Where's Mayuri?
Mayusha didn't come today.
I guess I'm a little early.
She said she'd meet me here.
Really?
It's okay if I wait here.
Oh, of course.
Thank you.
Isn't your younger sister here?
What younger sister? Whose?
Whose? Hashide's?
Mine? All my younger sisters exist only in Form 2D.
Oh, you're talking about Susu.
Do you have other sisters?
Mayuri!
Ferris! Hand!
Ferris-tan!
This place is not at all safe.
I'm sure it's safe.
I'm sure it's safe.
I'm sure it's safe.
I'm sure it's safe.
I'm sure it's safe.
I'm sure it's safe.
This place is not at all safe.
Okarin!
May I come in?
Hallucinations and memory problems.
The Ministry of Health...
This is your lab.
You don't have to ask.
I guess so.
Yuki, you have such lovely clothes.
I knew you'd say that.
That's why I wanted to show them to you.
Oh, Ferris! Look at him!
We have Dr. Pepper, if...
Hey, Okarin! Where are you going?
Where? I'm just going to the bathroom.
Okarin!
Okabe-san!
Suzu!
Oh, hi!
Episode 1.
Absolute Zero.
The missing ring of the annihilator.
Ta-da!
The missing ring of the annihilator.
The missing ring of the annihilator.
Ta-da!
It's so cute!
I like it!
It's so cute! Thank you so much!
What?
Where is Okarin?
He went upstairs with Suzuha.
They wanted to talk about something.
I see.
First of all, you shouldn't pretend so much.
The words that you are the younger sister of Daru
made you only more suspicious.
Yeah.
But I didn't think that mom would want to get close to me so much.
Yuki and Daru met for the first time.
On a summer vacation.
She cosplayed Mayu's sister.
But soon she started coming here.
So we met.
But you are the one she will give life to.
Her future daughter.
Maybe she will feel something.
Father says that sooner or later
everything will be explained to her.
However, Daru, this girl really...
The fact that I am here
means that this part of the future has not changed.
Calm down.
During my childhood
I only saw this
in photos and videos.
The Third World War.
Yes.
Because my father and the team created the Time Machine
we were considered a rebel organization.
But Daru,
did Yuki and you run away somehow?
No.
I didn't run away.
Did you run away?
No.
Mom tried to protect me from military drones
and set herself on fire.
I saw her torn to pieces
right in front of me.
I almost drowned in her blood.
Uncle Okarin.
There is only hell
ahead of this world line.
The Time Machine made countries
fight against each other.
Many people died.
There is only horror and despair in this world.
There are five billion people in this world.
This is the future.
I beg you.
I failed.
Uncle Okarin.
I can't.
Uncle!
I went through so many world lines
that I lost count.
Regardless of the world line,
time was playing with people's lives.
I even saw you die.
Again and again.
Endless.
Believe me.
I found out where the man came from.
Don't try so hard.
I'm powerless.
But you've already changed
the world lines.
You said it yourself.
Uncle.
Then...
It's useless!
We can't change the world line.
It violates the rules
that govern our universe.
People like us can't just interfere
in God's affairs.
As soon as we start interfering,
we'll be punished.
It's awful.
You don't want to see it.
That's your answer.
There's still time.
I want you to change your mind.
I...
I won't give up.
As a result, Susa never came back.
Yes.
Did you argue with her?
Not really.
I see.
It's getting cold.
There were so many people
in the lab.
It was fun.
Really?
Yes.
I've been feeling sad
lately.
Was there no gift?
There was.
I'm used to
waiting for you in the lab
alone.
So I shouldn't feel lonely.
I don't know.
I was so lonely
that I wanted to cry.
It's like
I used to be
so happy.
It's an illusion.
An illusion.
The only ones
who came to the lab
were you, me and Daru.
You're right.
What is it?
Professor Izaki.
Nothing.
People from Viktor Kondoriya University
are reading a lecture in Akiba tomorrow.
I wanted to talk to their professor,
but it looks like
they're all drunk.
I see.
You're a normal person now.
You can handle it yourself.
Don't worry.
Okay.
I'm sorry to leave you alone.
Stay here.
The revolution in the world of artificial intelligence.
Viktor Kondoriya University.
This is Leskinen.
Kehobar's technical form, 2010. Lecture program.
This is the university she studied at.
I think...
I'm dying.
I don't want to die.
Hey, you.
I'm talking to you.
Where's the staff room?
This is the seminar conference.
Of course I know!
It's the same thing over and over again.
Over and over again?
You're the fourth one who's been telling me this since I was a kid.
The University of Victoria-Candoria.
The Institute for Brain Research.
Oh, I see. You found it and...
It's the fourth time I've heard it!
The University of Victoria-Candoria has...
...schoolgirls?
If you're going to be stupid, do it somewhere else.
They don't take students to any university.
Twenty-one years?
In other words, I'm an adult woman.
Not from a middle school, not from a junior school, not from a high school.
Any problems?
Well, Vitya, it's nothing.
I was wrong.
I'm sorry.
All right.
No matter what country I moved to, it happens.
It's not surprising.
Did you say something?
No, it's nothing.
Oh, not here.
You have a room for the staff.
Go there.
The doors are at the end of the hall.
Thank you.
Twenty-one years, then.
If I saw her there, I'd scream, legal loli rules.
Kirill?
Mayako?
Why?
Why is Mayako here?
No.
Only not again.
Mayako?
Mayako!
Mayako!
Mayako!
No.
Only not again.
Calm down.
This is the world line of Beth.
She doesn't look like her.
That's it.
Is that the girl?
Hi, everyone.
Good evening, everyone.
Thank you for attending my lecture.
I'm Alexis Leskinen from the Research Institute of the Brain of Victoria Kandoria.
I'm his translator and assistant, Hiyajo Maho.
Today our topic is the revolution in the world of artificial intelligence.
However, before we move on to it, I would like to present an article.
An analysis of the connection between neural and impulsive signals with memory in the temporal part.
This article was published by female researchers from our laboratory.
Our memories are stored in the core of the brain.
More precisely, in the temporal part.
Access to memories is provided in the same way as flash memory.
The brain works by sending signals from the neuron to the neuron.
At the end of the day, this is a pattern of electrical signals
that creates, accumulates and amplifies memories.
Unfortunately, the girl who promoted this theory died at the age of 17.
But using this theory as a basis, we were able to build a special system.
This system keeps human memories as data.
Unlike previous programs that do not have self-identification,
we developed artificial intelligence with data of human memories.
It has feelings and memories like a human.
Artificial intelligence with a heart.
The genius Makise Kurisu and her theory allowed us to create this system.
Without further ado, we want to demonstrate this artificial intelligence.
Amadeus.
