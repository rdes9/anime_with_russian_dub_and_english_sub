Why are you here?
It's not just me.
Mayuri and Hashida too.
It's about time.
The six of us will begin our journey.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
It's about time.
The 65,536th meeting will begin.
Where...
Where am I?
My body...
is heavy.
It's...
What's wrong with me?
What happened?
Where am I?
Is this...
really me?
Yes.
Where am I?
Did I not move in time?
What the...
What is this?
It's...
It's...
It's...
It's...
It's...
It's...
Where...
Where am I?
I can't...
This can't be...
And Akiba...
Yes, the lab...
What? What about the others?
Hey, you! What are you doing here?
Answer me! This zone is closed for civilians.
Put your hands behind your head.
Name your ID.
Name your ID!
Oh, you little...
Suzuka!
Who are you? How do you know my name?
What? What are you talking about?
Have you forgotten me?
What are you talking about?
I'm Kaba. Kaba...
Kaba...
Kaba...
Kaba...
I'm Kaba... Kaba Rintaro.
Kaba... Rintaro?
That's impossible.
I'm Kaba.
Okay, I'm Kaba.
I'm Kaba Rintaro.
Okay, I'm Kaba.
I'm Kaba.
Hey, I'm Kaba Rintaro.
I'm Kaba Rintaro.
You're Kaba Rintaro?
Oh, yeah.
Oh, okay.
What are you doing here?
I'm Kaba Rintaro.
What?
Oh, I'm Kaba Rintaro.
I don't know what to do with you, but I don't know what to do with you, but I don't know what to do with you, but I don't know what to do with you, but I don't know what to do with you, but I don't know what to do with you, but I don't know what to do with you, but I don't know what to do with you, but I don't know what to do with you, but I don't know what to do with you, but I don't know what to do with you, but I don't know what to do with you, but I don't know what to do with you, but I don't know what to do with you, but I don't know what to do with you, but I don't know what to do with you, but I don't know what to do with you, but I don't know what to do with you, but I don't know what to do with you, but I don't know what to do with you, but I don't
care.
I don't care.
So now I'm gonna talk to you like before.
So now I'm gonna talk to you like before.
We haven't seen each other for ages.
We haven't seen each other for ages.
Well, way to get!
You didn't remember me like you did, so some nice guy?
Don't you do?
Maybe if you lost some weight.
You're right.
Daru, tell me, what year is it now?
2036. The world has plunged into a real chaos.
2036.
You can't believe it?
No. To believe it is all I can.
It's been 25 years. We're all old freaks.
It doesn't make sense. I'm supposed to be in 2025.
I want to know why Uncle Ocarin is alive.
You said he died a long time ago.
I never lied. Ocarin died.
Tell me, what do you remember about Ocarin?
Well, I... I used a time-jump machine to save my Yuri.
But when I woke up...
That day, our machine didn't work.
We didn't know the exact reason, but the time-jump machine let us down.
As a result, we exceeded the limit of 48 hours to get back that day.
All this time, the world was plunging into chaos, competing for the time machine.
You mean to say, my Yuri...
My Yuri...
A few hours after it disappeared, we decided to build the time machine on our own.
It was the beginning of Valkyrie.
Valkyrie...
But at the same time, it was the beginning of our war with the world.
The world...
The world...
All countries of the world wanted to get the time machine theory.
Many believed that Makis and Kurisu's theories were the most accurate.
Or rather, Akaba Rintar and this organization in Valkyrie.
Dad and the others were looking in every corner of the world.
And then, in 2025...
Daru, we have bad news.
Hey, what happened?
Stratford, he caught me.
Seriously? That's bad. Come back!
Never.
I will not be subjected to the members of the Dangerous Laboratory.
And Daru...
Then, thank you for supporting me when it was bad.
Daru, I expect you to finish the time machine.
Akarin?
The rest is up to you.
Stop, Akarin!
After that, Stratford was caught and tortured.
When Dad came to save you, then...
Yeah...
And then...
When Dad came to save you, then...
Yeah...
When we found him, the endless tortures and experiments caused great damage.
The mind was almost dead.
That is...
His heart was no longer to be returned.
The body was healthy, but the will to live disappeared.
Although the body functioned.
That's why you said he was dead.
It was the only choice.
They would have continued to fight for Akarin, regardless of his condition.
I still don't understand why you didn't tell me right away.
So I spent 11 years there?
Yes.
Under the care of very few who knew the truth.
Wait.
But why did Uncle Akarin wake up?
Uncle Akarin...
Time jump machine?
That's right.
What are you talking about?
Using the time machine, they rewritten the data of my brain in 2011.
I see.
It so happened that recently we found them on the old PC.
Of course, it was still an adventure.
I can't believe it.
Deceiving the world is one thing, but how could you lie to me?
Deceiving the world...
Deceiving the world...
I'm sure you need time to accept it, so don't worry.
I'll contact the others and let them know that you're alive.
You'll contact them?
Yes.
You were not 11 years old.
The laboratory members have been waiting for this day for a long time.
Episode 20.
Renaissance of the Unwavering Resurrection.
The promised renaissance.
Everything is calm here.
Everything is fine.
This is the same place, right?
It should be.
You need to take your things, as usual.
This is Baral Titor.
Report.
The Cheshire cat is here.
What's going on?
The warrior is with you.
Dania?
I need you to listen to me.
Akarin is awake.
Is this true?
This is...
Ruka and Ferris.
They were the ones who took care of you all this time.
So that's how it is.
Wait a minute.
Why is Sister Nkarumi doing paikas?
There is no such plan for today.
What?
Are you sure?
Last night we received a message that you should be here.
A trap.
Brother Ruka!
Sister!
Dad!
Okidoki!
Wait.
I'm with you.
Wait.
It's not in your condition.
Please.
Thank you.
It's not good.
They're going to destroy us.
I'll take care of them.
Go away from Ferris.
And bring reinforcements.
What?
You're crazy.
It's impossible, Ruka.
I'll be fine.
I won't die until I see Akabe again.
Ruka.
Ruka.
Ruka.
Ruka.
Go.
But...
Hold on, Ruka.
Susu!
It's 12 o'clock!
Ferris!
Susu!
Daru!
Ferris!
Kyoma!
Kyoma!
Kyoma!
Kyoma!
Kyoma!
Wake up!
I'm sorry about that.
Brother Ruka?
That's right!
Rukin has troubles!
He's staying to keep them.
What?
I can't hear anything.
Come here, he's here!
Brother Ruka!
Rukin!
Rukako.
Hey, Rukako.
Rukako!
Kyoma.
It's me, Rukako.
Rukako!
The way you call me, it's true, Kyoma.
Rukako!
Thank God.
Now that you're back, I can rest.
What are you talking about?
Hey, Kyoma.
I did it.
You taught me, Kyoma,
how to use the Seishinzen sword.
I protected everyone.
Do you think I'm finally a member of the laboratory?
I can now be worthy of being your comrade.
You're a fool.
You've been with us from the very beginning.
You've always been our comrade.
You're a member of Laboratory 006.
I see.
I'm so happy.
Now I can proudly see Mayuri.
Rukako!
Rukako!
Thank God.
Ruka wanted to see you more than anyone.
He was always waiting for this day.
And in the end, his wish came true.
Ruka!
Long time no see, Okabe.
Hey, Adjo.
I'm sorry I'm not strong.
It's all over.
It's okay.
I have to say, I was surprised to see you and Ferris.
Are you saying I look like a child regardless of age?
Well, it's a compliment for me.
Do we seem indifferent to you?
Rushibaru just died, and everyone is so calm.
Don't you think?
No.
Now, starting on July 7, 2011, a lot of people died.
Families, friends, relatives,
adults and children.
We just can't sit and grieve.
That's the reality we have.
I knew it.
Suzuhara always told me
What kind of future is waiting for the world line that I chose?
It seemed to me that I understood.
But...
I only convinced myself of this.
I said it to just run away from the truth.
Even after the death of Kurisu, I lost my Reisuzuha and Kagari.
And Kagari, and Yuki, and Rukako.
In the end, I didn't understand anything, damn it!
Eleven years ago.
Eleven years ago, you always said something like that.
That you didn't understand anything.
But you said the same thing.
Nothing has lost its meaning, even if it seems so.
A lot of options of the future.
A past that cannot be returned.
But even so, in addition to all this, there is a path that leads to the line of Bratstein.
Brat...
...Stein.
A lot.
A lot of options of the future.
The past.
The future.
The world.
Hiyajin Daru.
Now.
I'm from 2011.
Thanks to the Time Jump Machine, you successfully rewritten my memories in 2036.
Is that so?
Yes.
If you say so, then everything is correct.
That means the time machine still exists.
Prepare it for use.
Akarin?
You're...
Once again.
I'll come back and find the Bratstein line.
