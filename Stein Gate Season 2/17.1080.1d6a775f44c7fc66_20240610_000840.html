        <pre>Hey, Suzuha, are you here, my beautiful little daughter?
What do you mean, my beautiful little daughter?
That means you're my favorite daughter.
I didn't mean that.
What? Do you have any problems?
No, nothing.
If you know too many details,
there may be a temporary paradox in the future.
I don't think so.
I don't think so either.
Damn, I found it after all.
It's a good way to disguise yourself,
but you should try harder.
But if I don't work with her now,
how am I going to figure out how to build it in the future?
Don't cheat.
You can do it.
If I couldn't, I wouldn't be here.
I don't think so.
I don't think so either.
If I couldn't, I wouldn't be here.
Have you decided?
Yes.
I see.
My problem is that I'm too happy to be here.
I wouldn't mind staying here forever.
I know it's impossible,
but I can't help but dream.
Who's there?
Mayusha?
What's going on?
Suzu.
Did something happen?
You came to us from the future.
Everyone knows something about it except me.
My sister.
I want you to tell them about Mayusha and Makise Kurisu.

I hope you'll like it.
Where's Daru?
We don't have anything, and he went to buy some tea.
That's good.
It's better to have such conversations with fewer people.
You want to listen too?
Yes, I'm a scientist.
I can help you give a logical explanation.
So, Maha knows everything too?
I made a general idea from what I was told.
Before that, I need to ask you.
Why did you suddenly want to know this?
Just...
Until this moment, I was afraid to know the future.
But...
But?
Yesterday, I ran into Karin.
And he said,
Don't think about anything.
Everything is fine now.
But...
He looked so sad.
He's been so sad since last year.
So that's what happened.
I just don't think it'll help.
Uncle Karin.
I understand.
But...
Even so, I want to.
If I never hear it, I know I'll regret it.
Okay.
Just so you know, no one can bring memories from other worlds.
In the best case, I can tell you what Uncle Karin told me himself.
And about Makise Kurisu...
Is it true that Makise Kurisu sacrificed herself to save me?
I don't know if she was sacrificed for the sake of this world.
However, it is clear that there were two world lines.
In the Alpha line, Makise Kurisu is alive, and Mayuri dies.
And in the Beta line, Makise Kurisu is dead, but Mayuri continues to live.
The world line we are in now is the Beta line.
Is that all there is?
There are only two world lines?
More.
No.
I want to believe that there are more of them.
The Wradstein line definitely exists.
Wradstein?
A world where none of you die, and conflicts over the time machine and the Third World War managed to escape.
My father told me about this in the future.
This is an unknown line that we are trying to reach.
Uncle Karin lived the same summer over and over again, trying to find a way there.
He believed that there was a way to save you both.
Well...
So it's because Mayusha stopped him that time.
It's not your fault.
To be honest, Uncle Karin was completely crushed then.
He has the ability to remember events from different world lines, reading Steiner.
In addition, because of this, he has preserved memories of many people from different lines.
The feelings they tried to hide, the things they failed to achieve.
The fear of losing those who should exist.
Only one of these memories is not enough to hurt the heart.
That's why I'm actually glad you stopped him.
But if I didn't stop him, then...
Karin...
Karin...
Just like Mayusha's sister from the future.
You looked at the sky sadly and said,
on that day, if Hikaboshi came back to life, everything would have changed.
I was late.
You obviously weren't in a hurry. Where were you so late?
I was a little late. This is Ginza.
Why her?
Is it someone's birthday?
It's a farewell.
Farewell?
Here are the crusts that you like. It would be easier.
Why did you decide that I love them?
Farewell...
Do you want to say...
Yes, I'm going today.
If I continue to do nothing, then in the end I will not be able to achieve the 28th of July last year when Makise Kurisu died.
Last year...
You don't have enough fuel to come back, do you?
Do you think you can do it?
I don't know. That's why I wanted to prepare your time machine.
To try more than once.
Sozu, are you going back to the past? What will happen when you come back?
Who knows? I won't come back, that's for sure.
Convergence of the world line may mean that irregularity like me was corrected.
Corrected?
Suzu, wait! You can't go!
No!
Suzu! Daru!
Suzu, do it!
Okey-dokey! Thank you for the cookies.
Daru...
Well, it's time to start the mission.
Are you okay?
You're right. You're Father Suzu, right, Daru?
I don't like it. You have to stop her.
I won't.
Akarin?
Makise Kurisu.
Akarin?
Mayuri?
Hello? Suzu, Suzu is in trouble.
Suzu?
Yes. She's going to go to the time machine a year ago.
She's leaving and won't be able to come back.
Why did you...
What?
Why did you talk about it again?
You tried to find out everything. I told you.
You'd better not know about it.
It's our time.
What happened?
All this year...
I've been thinking all the time.
Why, after 25 years, I've decided to send Suzu to this era.
I think I wanted her to see this world.
That's what helped me make the decision.
To fulfill my duty as Suzu wanted.
To do what only I can do.
And what is it?
In 25 years, this guy will create the very first time machine in the history of mankind.
But then...
What can I do?
I want to help, but I can't do anything.
You made Akarin stand on his feet.
Isn't that enough?
This day...
If my Hikaboshi came back to life,
everything would have changed.
This is...
Hikaboshi Myoshi.
Hikaboshi Myoshi...
Since then, he was very lonely.
Last year, he lost something.
And I want him to find it.
I want him to be himself again.
I want so much that I can cry.
I want so much that I can scream.
I love Akarin.
Maybe just like Kurisu.
No, that's wrong.
Stronger.
Kurisu will never compare to me.
I love her so much.
But...
But I love Hououin Kyoumu even more.
When I wanted to disappear forever,
he said that I should stay in this world.
I...
I want to see Hououin Kyoumu again.
I want to hear his annoying laugh again.
Even if it means that I will never be Arihime.
Even so.
For me, there is only one Hikaboshi.
It's Akabe Rintaro and no one else.
In that case,
if this is your choice,
you know what to do.
Daru...
Maho...
For today, Mayusha will no longer be a hostage.
Episode 17
Altair Hyperbolic Plane
Pseudosphere Beltrami
What's going on?
There's no connection.
Today is Double Seven Day.
Arihime will meet you in a mini skirt.
Mayuri!
Akabe?
Daru, where's Mayuri?
What? Well...
The phones don't work.
Why?
I noticed too.
I think there was a failure in the Akihabara area.
And it hasn't been fixed yet.
Is the Internet there?
Yes.
But it seems that the information was hidden,
because there is no word about it anywhere.
And I also went to the dog channel,
but it seems that the page was broken.
Broken?
These messages...
It seems that we, the twins,
were temporarily expelled from the place
that we belong to.
Our Father God finally understood
how to get to the sacred possessions.
So now we can tell our father
the secrets of time management
and where they are.
I'm sorry I couldn't save them.
Father God?
Yes.
Look.
So please pass this message
to the one I respect very much.
I've always looked at myself as an intermediary.
However, you have always been a person
whom I wanted to become.
And you...
You are a true Amadeus.
I have an idea. Who is this?
No doubt.
This is Amadeus Kurisu.
Seriously?
Can you get access to Amadeus?
Yes.
What is it?
What is it?
All the data is missing.
We were expelled from the place
that we belong to, just as it says.
So the secrets of time management
and where they are...
It can't be!
Kurisu's memories!
Impossible!
Did they break the protection
of Amadeus's memory data?
Don't you think that someone knows
that the time machine is here now?
But no...
Daru,
what's wrong with you?
Akarin!
You...
Kyaaa...
Mayuri, is Suzuka there?
Suzuka was trying to make
future-美味илаês doute pull herself together.
But Mayuri goes after her.
Mayuri!
We have no chance of getting hurt while
the time machine exists.
Is it gonna run again?
P slightly podem.
Suzuko!
Don't try to stop me. I...
No. I want to be with you. Take me with you.
Until the 21st of August last year.
August?
Yes. When Karina and Suda went on a time travel.
I want to arrive right after that.
There is no point if not at this moment.
Are you sure?
We won't be able to come back.
Are you okay with that?
I can't pretend that Hikaboshi didn't exist.
I can't pretend that the future doesn't spare me.
Okay.
Mayuri!
Where are you going?
Do you know what you're doing?
Why did it come to this?
I've come to terms with how it all ended.
Why? Why did it come to this?
If you come any closer, I'll shoot.
Mayuri, you shouldn't do anything.
Don't destroy what's there.
If you do that, all the victims will be in vain.
The chicken's death will be in vain.
I can't. I can't allow it.
Akarin!
It's okay. It's just a matter of time.
I can't. I... I...
Akarin!
I... I...
Even so...
Even so...
Let's not pretend like nothing happened.
Mayuri...
Even when it rains, the stars don't disappear from this world.
They shine so brightly behind the clouds.
That's why I moved the clouds to the top of your sky.
Mayuri...
Wait.
Mayuri... Mayuri!
Are you sure about your decision?
Yes.
I'm sorry.
The blood has stopped, so don't worry.
What are you going to do?
I've already told you to complete your mission.
I'm going to change the future for the people I love.
Although I have doubts.
Uncle Akarin...
Goodbye.
From Dad?
D-mail from 2025?
Yo, Suzuh. It's your father.
It's 2025 now.
Dad...
If this video came, then you...
You and Mayusha most likely found another way to the Wradstein line.
You may not realize this, but two of your choices have slightly changed the world line.
World line?
In other words, I am Ruhashida from another world, not from the one you left.
Nevertheless, the love for my daughter is the same everywhere.
Let's move on to the essence of this message.
I'll tell you about the details of the Arclight operation.
Sister Mayu!
Drop your weapon and lie down on the ground.
Suzuh!
Shut up. If you shout, they'll kill you.
You see I'm a girl. Be more delicate.
Mission two and three completed. Mission one completed.
However, it is closed. Biometry?
Stand up.
Okay.
Suzuh!
Throw something. I'll shoot.
I know.
It works.
Good!
Sister Mayu, run!
Sister Mayu!
Kagari?
Kagari?
I'm sorry.
Kagari?
Thank you for choosing us.
I'm here.
I'm here.
I'm here.

I'm here.
I'm here.
I'm here.
I'm here.
I'm here.

I'm here.

I'm here.
I'm here.
I'm here.
I'm here.
