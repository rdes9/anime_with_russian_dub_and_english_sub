Akabe, why did you come so early today?
Hiyaji, I have a question.
What?
Are you not going to talk to the monsters anymore?
Because of the message, Amadeus is not here.
Amadeus?
Amadeus!
Amadeus!
Amadeus!
Amadeus!
Amadeus!
Amadeus!
Amadeus!
Amadeus!
Amadeus!
Amadeus!
Amadeus!
Because of that message, Amadeus was not created, but I still met Hiyaji.
True, already under other circumstances.
Even when the world line has changed, the fate that tied us, these connections,
have they changed to lead us?
Mayuri?
Yeah.
Susu.
Susu got into trouble.
Susuhu?
Yeah.
She's going to use the time machine and move back a year ago.
She won't be able to come back.
Why are you...
What?
Why did you decide to tell me about it?
There's no time for that.
I can't even know for sure what exactly has changed.
The only thing that matters is that they use the time machine.
Kagari?
Why so early?
Okabe?
Kagari is still looking for the time machine.
We need to find it and stop it.
Rintaro!
What are you doing in such a place?
I suspect that you know more about the time machine than I expected.
Where's Kagari?
After she ran away, I know that she met you and your friends.
What exactly do you know?
I see.
There's a difference in the lines because Amadeus wasn't in it.
Maybe the professor didn't finish brainwashing Kagari.
Professor Leskinen, I know what you didn't even think about.
Do you want to know?
I'll tell you everything.
Moeka.
Okabe!
I'm fine.
I need to see a doctor.
There's no time for that.
I need your help.
The lab's employee 005.
Kiryu Moeka.
No, don't!
Kagari!
Kagari.
I won't let you change the past.
I won't let you cancel my meeting with my mom.
No one will get into the time machine.
Sozu, is that Kagari?
Why?
My mom, Yuri.
My mom wants to change the future, just like Sozu's sister.
My mom wants us to never meet again.
Kagari.
I don't want that.
I don't care what the future will be.
It's the only future that means something to me.
What is it, Kagari?
Can't you?
You!
Kagari.
Please, stop.
It's dangerous.
Mom, don't come closer.
I have to.
My sister!
Mom!
It's so scary.
I even held my breath.
But I'm glad you didn't shoot me.
Mom!
Listen.
Kagari.
As you can see, I'm going with Suzuka to the time machine in the past.
To open the eyes of a man special to me.
You can't.
It doesn't matter how hard mom and Sozu's sister will try.
Nothing good will come out of it.
It won't work.
The fuel will be enough for one jump.
You won't be able to come back.
You don't even know what's going to happen.
Kagari.
It may be senseless or hopeless.
But Akarin is different.
Akarin has the power to change the future.
No.
I think everyone has it.
But Akarin uses it to make the world go the right way.
That's why I want to push him when it's necessary.
If that's all I need, I can do it.
That's the only thing Mayusha can do for his Hikaboshi.
Hikaboshi?
On that day, if my Hikaboshi came back to life...
Mom...
Hikaboshi?
Kagari.
You have to jump with us.
Come back to the past with us.
To change the future.
The future shouldn't be like this.
And no one should die.
Instead, we will create a world where everyone will be happy.
Let's go.
Kagari.
Together.
Mom.
Do it for me.
Akarin.
Maeko.
Uncle Akarin.
Listen.
I came here from the future.
I use the time jump machine.
There will be a battle zone here.
You need to go back to the past as soon as possible.
Impossible.
The professor doesn't know anything.
He's unconscious right now, but that's just a matter of time.
Akarin.
Lab Co-worker 002.
My decision.
Do your operation Arclight.
Use your brain.
I feel sorry for him.
Yes.
I can do it.
Kagari.
Let's go.
Mom.
Maeko.
I won't last long.
Faster.
Kagari.
Let's go.
Mom.
Akarin.
Akarin.
Akarin.
Are you happy that you won't see her again?
Aren't you sad?
What are you talking about?
Mayuri is my precious hostage.
I'll go after her.
And I'll come back.
Kagari.
Kagari.
Come on.
I won't let them get in your way.
Kagari.
Mayuri.
My sister.
Kagari.
Mom Hikaboshi.
I trust you.
You said we'd meet again with Mom.
Put it on me.
You came after all.
Hokabe.
Mom.
I see.
It's time.
The time has come.
Hikaboshi.
Mom.
What's wrong, Hikaboshi?
Mom.
Mom.
Hikaboshi.
Mom.
Hikaboshi.
There's nothing to be afraid of!
Here it is!
This moment!
This moment!
Listen carefully, fools!
Schrodinger's box is open!
The time machine you wanted to get is no more!
It has gone through space and time and disappeared!
Get out of the way and tremble with fear!
I, Houen Kyouma, am together with fate against you, and we will win!
No matter how, I will find the Stein Gate!
And this...
is my...
choice!
What?
Two time machines!
Oh, it's from me!
What?
What's going on?
I think I'll answer.
Hello?
Who is this?
Please, listen to what I have to say.
You love Houen Kyouma, don't you?
In a minute...
Akarin will come back, but he won't be able to save Makise.
Whatever it takes, you have to resist Yagabushi and open his eyes!
Yagabushi...
Here!
Houen Kyouma...
Akarin's heart will be broken, but you have to help him!
Just calling by name is not enough!
30 seconds left!
Remember the moment when Houen Kyouma was born!
The moment when Houen Kyouma was born...
I feel that I have trusted you for more than 26 years!
I believe!
In Akarin, in my friends, and in myself!
That's why you have to believe!
The rest is up to you!
Wait!
Sister Mayu, it's time to go!
The Stein Gate!
The Stein Gate exists!
Yes...
I'm sure!
The second...
also disappeared!
Who was that call from?
I'm sorry, Sister Mayu.
It seems hopeless.
Yes, because there is no fuel.
If we stayed, it would cause a paradox, so we had to jump.
It may be our end.
We can get into an accidental era.
A year ago, a million years ago.
Suzu, thank you.
Sister Mayu.
For taking me with you today.
I'm sure that other Mayushis and Hikaboshi will take care of the rest.
Right now I'm very jealous of Uncle Karin.
I wish I had a reading Steiner.
I would remember everything, even if the line had changed.
Sister Mayu is younger than me.
The moment that is happening now.
I won't be able to talk to Suzu for another six years.
Although, if you're just born, you won't be able to talk much.
Hey, Akarin.
When the world seems gloomy.
And you're afraid of the shadows.
Don't close your eyes.
Don't give up.
Don't kill Hououin Kyoumu.
Then my feelings will reach you.
Even if I move for hundreds and thousands of hours.
Just like the light of a star.
Mayu will be waiting in the laboratory.
Waiting for you and everyone else.
Let's meet again at Steiner's gate.
I killed her.
It's okay.
It's not his blood.
Akarin?
It's Akarin's phone.
A message?
Read it.
But...
Do it.
Turn on the news.
News?
Despite the fire in the cargo compartment, the plane with Dr. Nakabachi
successfully landed in Russia, where he recently moved to.
What?
This is the metal opa of Mayu.
What is she doing in Russia?
Everything happened because of the paper.
Because of this, the most developed countries will enter the gong to create a time machine.
And this will be the reason for the war.
On the eve of the life of more than five billion people.
Save Akise Kurisu.
Change the world line.
I can't.
It was the same with Mayuri.
The end is the same, regardless of my efforts.
Remember the moment when Hououin Kyoumu was born.
And the death of Kurisu.
I know.
I know how crazy this time cycle is.
I know how cruel fate is here.
I knew.
I knew it would happen.
I'm tired.
That's enough for me.
6 months later
The coordinates of the star dust intersection, the intersection of the Milky Way...
I greet myself.
15 years ago.
If you opened this message,
it means you still did not manage to save Kurisu.
You were in pain,
but this pain gave me a solution, so I can't afford to change it.
Now let's move on to the real goal of our plan.
Save Makis Kuris and find the Stein Gate.
I was the one who named the Stein Gate the world line.
I'm sure you understand why I chose this name.
It doesn't mean anything, does it?
Hey, are you sure?
Yeah, I guess so.
Will Kaberintar be ashamed of this in 2010?
Don't worry, he was even more wonderful back then.
I don't even want to imagine it.
Now I'm going to tell you about your last mission of the Skuld operation.
You need to change the result without changing the set events.
Deceive yourself. Deceive this world.
And only in this way will you be able to reach the Stein Gate line.
Good luck to you, El Psy Kongru.
It's taken! It was perfect!
Now it remains to send this D-mail to the past.
Hand.
Got it.
I'll send this video to Yomi in 2010.
And the video with Itaru?
Send it to Suzuhi in 2011 after you send it, right?
Do you want this?
Something's wrong.
You're the first to start the time machine.
You said you were supposed to die in 2025.
But that doesn't mean you have to drop your...
I'm not going to do anything like that.
I'm completely confident in our success.
But...
What if we interpret it this way?
In 2025, Okabe Itaru doesn't die,
but he uses the first version of our time machine and goes to another space and time.
The disappearance of a person from the world line is essentially equal to death, isn't it?
That's some crazy positive thinking.
Although it's just theory, isn't it?
The world can be fooled.
Friends, thank you for being with me.
As you know, on this day in 2011, the time machine was lost in the past.
Now I'm leaving to find my Rie Suzuhi.
The black hole detector will help me find their locus.
It's supposed to lead me straight to them.
Akarin.
Take it.
Are you sure?
Yes.
Please, tell my mom about this.
Okay.
Let me ask you one last time.
Steiner's Gate.
Do they really exist?
Of course.
Be sure.
And now let's start the operation.
It's called
Operation Altair.
Do you think he'll make it?
Of course.
Tema will do it, Tanya.
That's for sure.
He does what's impossible.
He does what's impossible.
That's what Akarin does to our Akarin.
Akarin.
The universe has a beginning, but not an end.
Limitless.
The stars also have a beginning, but they die because of their own power.
Limitless.
The wise are the dumbest in the world, and history has proven it to us.
It's been read from history.
A fish that lives in the ocean doesn't know about life on land.
If it gets this wisdom, it will die.
A man that exceeds the speed of light is even more stupid than a fish that lives on land.
Limitless.
This is the last warning to God to those who continue to fight.
The epigraph of their stubbornness.
