Now in our program, a report on terrorist acts taking place in the city center.
It reminds me of military actions. All the nearest stations and shopping centers are closed.
Do terrorists take any other action?
We do not have exact data, but sources report that other terrorists can wait for the right moment.
The government calls on residents of all areas of Tokyo to stay home until the situation is under control.
