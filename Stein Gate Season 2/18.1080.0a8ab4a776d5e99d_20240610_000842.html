        <pre>Calm down. The world line hasn't changed.
So, Mayuri and Suzuhou are fine.
It didn't happen there.
Mayuri.
Hello, Rentaro.
Hello, Mayuri.
Rentaro.
Professor Leskinen?
Anilibria.TV presents...
Gate 0.
Mayuri and Suzuhou
Mayuri!
Reis?
What have you done to my mom?
What?
Mayuri!
Fire!
Don't be afraid!
Aim at the body! Slow down!
Kagari!
Are you interested in what's going on on the roof?
What do you want to say?
What are you doing here?
It's not good to answer the question by question, Rentaro.
I would never have thought that you would come here so quickly.
And who is this?
Who gave you such a big hint?
Macho?
No.
I believe that someone was there.
Kurisu.
Kurisu?
Father of God.
Professor.
The one who created the system for Amadeus.
Amadeus.
Amadeus.
Amadeus.
Amadeus.
Amadeus.
Amadeus.
The one who created the system for Amadeus.
And Father of God.
Did she really say something like that?
Great words.
I'm even pleased when she praises me like that.
But at the same time, she was supposed to say that.
Our secret houses have been exposed,
so we have to tell our father the secrets of time management.
Bad, Rentaro.
If you received such a message, you should already know the answer.
I'm afraid you've gone too far.
Who are you?
Who are you?
Just a scientist.
Science is not always charity, you know.
Maybe you heard about the strategic focus company.
Strat...
Stratfor?
This is a private intelligence agency under the supervision of the CIA.
So you're from the very beginning.
America, Russia.
Now the conflict between the great powers
will intensify for the sake of getting the time machine.
I couldn't act earlier because I was waiting for this moment.
I'm sick of the excitement that this day has finally come.
I think you know what I'm talking about, Rentaro.
Yeah, what's going on?
How does he know all this?
Haruji?
No, she couldn't.
No, not like that.
Amadeus has memories of Kurisu before his trip to Japan.
Then who is it?
Judging by your face, you're desperately trying to figure out
how I know all this.
There's someone else.
A man who knows everything.
A little messenger from the future.
Kagari!
My little sister.
Suzu...
Don't move.
You've been hit by a ricochet.
But the blood is still running.
It's...
Don't look!
Don't look!
Mom...
Mom...
What have you done to Mom?
They haven't calmed down yet.
I told them not to fuss.
Mayuri...
Mayuri!
Kagari?
No, my little sister!
What is this?
Mayuri!
Mom...
Mom, it's not me.
Because Mom...
Mom...
Mom!
I'm sorry, Mom!
Mom!
I'm sorry, Mom!
Kagari!
Mom...
Don't move.
Suzu...
What's wrong with Mayuri?
She's been hit a little.
But she's fine.
No other injuries.
Good.
Mayuri is safe.
Yes.
Thank God.
Don't talk.
Everything's fine.
Don't worry about me.
Because, despite the wounds,
I don't feel any pain.
Don't try to be strong.
Just...
I heard God's voice.
He said it didn't hurt.
He said you can't suffer.
That's why it's not...
Kagari!
Kagari!
Suzu!
Kagari!
Mom...
Thank God.
Kagari...
Sister Suzuha...
I'm sorry.
Every time I hear God's voice,
I get confused.
He tells me what I should do.
And I do.
Forgive me.
Kagari!
I think I missed a big party.
Mind control methods are going to be incredible in the future.
Professor!
You did it, Kagari!
No.
It's more of a joint effort.
Me and, perhaps, me.
I don't know what you're talking about.
But it's your fault that this happened, Kagari!
What if it is?
You bastard!
I'm so glad you stopped.
Suzuha...
I'm sorry.
Suzuha!
Professor!
Maku, are you out of your mind?
It's hard to believe.
I know.
This was meant to happen.
It was meant to happen?
Observation and prudence.
That's what distinguishes scientists.
Didn't you hear?
It's all a joint effort of me and me.
It took all the time.
Time?
Impossible!
Thirteen years ago, when Kagari first contacted me,
what do you think happened?
I heard the voice of God.
God?
You're from the future.
You called me.
Episode 18.
Altair of Translation Symmetry.
Translation Symmetry.
You're from the future?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
That's right.
You can believe it.
I sent Kagari back to the past from the future.
All so that I could control time.
For this?
So, Kagari...
It was a well-planned plan.
In order to track the action of resistance that you create in the future,
I taught a lot of children to spy,
so that they could infiltrate your organization.
You're all so soft-hearted that you fell for it.
But then came the best part of my plan.
If you managed to escape to the past,
then I took care of sending you a messenger
who had already been brainwashed.
I can hardly believe it myself.
But the more I went deeper into the research,
the more convinced I was that her story was true.
I came to the conclusion that the Time Machine is real
and that Kagari really came from the future.
So you created Amadeus because...
That's right.
Because Kurisu was supposed to die.
I needed a system that preserved her precious theory of the Time Machine
and other memories.
Professor!
And just for that, you practically allowed her to die!
Professor!
All I did was long and tiring work
to steal the Time Machine today.
To challenge the cause, to overcome the convergence,
a grand plan of the future for me
so that I could determine the paths of this world myself.
You've come so far.
What were you going to do after getting the Time Machine?
Rintaro, you don't understand the whole essence of science.
It's the scientists' business.
We experiment in the hope that our theories will be confirmed
and we live to observe this.
In the future, I had a theory,
and the past needs to be proven.
That's all. That's what I did everything for.
You're creating a temporary paradox.
You can't fix this world or you're not afraid to break it.
If that happens, I want to see it with my own eyes.
I think if she's dead,
brainwashing won't help much in the future.
You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you!
I can't ask for a better compliment, Rintaro.
You couldn't have got out of the way.
This is going to be a battlefield soon.
with a time machine in the center of everything.
Battles?
Dr. Nakabachi's article was published in Russia.
In addition, I gave some information about the time machine to Stratfor.
So this information war will develop from both sides.
History says that the time machine will be destroyed here,
but it should not exist for another 25 years.
Only the basis in the form of theory.
What if someone just stole it in a good time?
What if its destruction was done and gone into the past?
So this is your plan?
More than ten years have passed since the meeting with Kagari.
How much time?
I went so far, but it's time.
God's voice!
I hear!
God's voice!
Take your hands off!
It's too early to turn off!
The suffering of Kagari was a thousand times worse!
But much worse!
After all, she was so bad!
Get up, damn it!
Your mother!
Suzuka!
Let go!
Don't get in my way!
Suzuka!
Suzuka, that's enough!
Dad...
You'll kill him and you'll be exactly the same.
I will continue to fight.
Kagari!
Kagari!
Kagari!
Look, Suzuka is here!
This hand holding me
when it was terribly warm.
Kagari, I'm sorry.
Sister Suzuka, I'm sorry.
Kagari! Kagari!
Why? Why did it come to this?
What the...
Run!
Mayuri!
It's okay. She's not wounded.
Found the Professor.
It's...
Suzuka!
Now!
The time machine will be destroyed soon, right?
We need to get out of here before it's too late.
We need to change the future.
Is that Darpa?
Radikagari too.
Let's go inside.
Yes.
Wait, Mayuri!
Bakarin!
Why?
Why did you decide to do this?
Mayuri!
Mayuri!
Mayusha, we need to get out of here!
Because this is...
Operation Arclight!
Arclight?
Sister Maya!
Mayuri!
Wait, Mayuri!
Suzuka...
Damn! Defend the target!
This is seriously happening in Tokyo!
Mayuri!
Let's go!
Yes!
Mayuri!
It's...
The time machine.
They didn't make it in time.
Suzuka!
Mayuri!
Mayuri!
Okaba!
Mayuri!
Mayuri!
Mayuri!
Mayuri!
Mayuri!
It's not ready yet!
Why?
Why did this happen?
Bakarin...
I...
I chose this world line because I thought it was the best option.
This...
This was the only world line built for the victim Kurisu.
And what?
What now?
Why?
Why?
Mayuri...
Dear Karin!
Tutturu!
It's Mayusha!
To be honest, I wanted to talk to you personally, but I'm not sure if it will work.
Besides, I was afraid that you would want to stop me, so I'll tell you everything here.
I went with Suzuka to the past.
Maybe you're upset and don't understand why.
But...
I had to do it.
Because...
Yes, only I could.
Regardless of bad things, my strong Hikaboshi would come back laughing.
But I hid him behind the dark clouds.
Do you understand?
I think I was wrong.
No one has changed the future solely because of Karin.
We must find Ashteyn's Gate together.
Everyone is on your side.
Dara is with you.
Suzuka too.
And Rokako.
And Firis.
And Yuki with us.
And even Maho.
Now it's my turn.
After all, I'm a member of Laboratory 002.
And this is my first big mission.
I'm sure Karin will be worried, but that's good.
Besides, if something happens, my heart knows that you will come to save me.
My beloved Houen Kyouma will come and create a new time machine.
That's why I decided to go.
I promise I'll come back.
So wait for me.
I love Houen Kyouma.
But you know what?
I love you more.
I love you more.
