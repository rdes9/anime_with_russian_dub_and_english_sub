        <pre>I was asked to come. I'm Moeka Kiryu.
And you?
Oh, you're already here.
Akarin, why did you get up? Let the girl go.
Oh, yeah.
Bring the tea.
Moeka Kiryu.
Why?
How would she know?
EPISODE 5 STIGMATISM LONELINESS
There are no human victims.
The bodies found in each of them were taken out of the brain.
Most of them belong to the orangutan chimpanzee,
as well as to other species of monkeys.
What is it?
Oh, nothing.
Calm down.
This is not the world line anymore.
We are not connected to CERN.
Moeka will not kill Mayuri.
Will not kill Mayuri.
Will not kill.
Uncle, are you okay?
I'm fine.
Daru, can you introduce us?
Who is this?
This is Kiryu.
She writes articles for magazines.
I'm Moeka Kiryu.
Not so long ago, one magazine published a number of articles about the city legends of Akibe.
Then she contacted me to ask me about my work.
Work?
Well, the one I can't even speak of.
And although I always carefully sweep the tracks,
Kiryu somehow figured me out.
And that's why you decided to turn to her?
You're looking for someone, as I understand.
To be more precise, we are looking for a girl who disappeared in Akibe 12 years ago.
12 years ago?
Yeah.
Her name is Shina Kagari.
12 years ago she was 10, so now she is 22 years old.
Is she alive?
We don't know for sure, but the girl in this photo looks like her.
Can we trust her?
Let her not intersect with us in this world line.
And she has no reason to kill Mayuri.
But it is quite likely that in this world she is a Raunder and can kill without blinking an eye.
What?
Can I get to the point?
Can you help?
But I don't know if I can find her.
Of course, you can't do anything here.
If you manage, you'll get a reward.
But we'll take all the costs, okay?
Okay.
Akarin, don't you mind?
No.
Great, you're officially hired.
Let's go, Naya.
Coming.
That's it.
Don't forget to fasten yourself.
Yeah.
Ready?
Yeah.
Let's go!
Let's go!
So, who was that?
Huh?
You recognized her, didn't you?
What did you take?
You can see through us.
You knew her, Akarin?
No, I didn't.
What about the world alpha line?
I see.
I won't pressure you, but remember this and I'll keep an eye on you.
That's enough for now.
What are you talking about?
Not about her, not about myself.
Ah, because Kiryu is stylish, sexy and perfect for those who like glasses.
Neurology Institute
I guess it's time to call a specialist.
I told you.
As long as I don't call, he just doesn't pick up the phone.
What's the matter?
The tester is out of his league.
Didn't you think he could lose his phone?
Well, let's hope so.
Maki Sakurisu is dead.
It's unusual to see how thoughtful you are leaning over a closed laptop.
Professor!
When did you get back?
Your Japanese supermarkets are just something.
Every day you can buy a different band, and every week the whole range changes.
If you keep eating like that, you'll ruin your health.
I'd look at my own table, and then I was judged.
So, where are you going?
I'm going to get a divorce.
In Akihabara.
In Akihabara?
I'm going to get a divorce in Akihabara.
Just admit that you're just going to Rentara.
That's not...
Isn't that right?
Well, maybe I'll go to him on the road.
On the road? Where on the road?
I'm telling you, he's going to get a divorce on the road.
So, to get a divorce on this very road, as you say, you'll be going to Akihabara in an hour,
where Rentara is going to happen.
Is that what you want to say?
I approve.
I'm going to him, but that's not what you think.
It's not like that at all.
What do you mean?
My working day is over.
Goodbye.
Say hello to Rentara.
TV LT repairs.
What is it?
My report.
Well?
It looks like it's not going to be easy to find her.
I see.
Did you find something?
No, there's just something here.
Let me have a look.
Hey!
During the investigation, one unusual fact was revealed.
There is evidence that in the last few months,
another group of people have been looking for Kagari's target.
What does it mean?
What's written on it.
Who's looking for her?
I don't know.
Maybe it's Suzuka?
I thought so too.
But look at this.
A group of men were looking for her.
Among them was a foreigner.
A foreigner?
But it's been 12 years.
Most likely she had acquaintances.
She wouldn't have lived long if she didn't know anyone.
It's true, but still.
At least we know one thing for sure now.
What?
We know that Shina Kagari is still alive.
A foreigner, right?
I think it's this way.
I'm in Akihabara now.
I was here for one thing.
I'll go to the lab shortly.
I'll go to the lab.
Damn it!
Please answer!
Hello!
Okabe!
Hiyaji?
I'm on my way to the lab.
Follow me!
Hiyaji!
Hiyaji!
Okarin!
Hiyaji!
It can't be!
It can't be!
Not this!
Not this!
Not this!
Hiyaji!
A woman?
Stop it!
Let go!
Stop!
Get your hands off her!
No!
Oh!
Are you Maho?
Yes, I am.
Hiyaji!
I told you not to.
I'm Judy Reyes.
Reyes?
Professor Judy Reyes.
She came to Japan for a conference on artificial intelligence, which will be this week.
Professor?
From the University of Victoria Condra?
Yes!
Nice to meet you.
I...
You can speak Japanese.
Surprised?
So you are Rintaro?
Alexis told me a lot.
Alexis?
Professor Leskinen.
She is a specialist in psychophysiology.
Connection between the body and the brain.
This area of science is studied as cognitive processes influence the activity of the organ.
In other words, her research brings much more benefit to humanity than my research.
That's not true at all.
Your Madeus will certainly be useful to many.
I'm very pleased that you think so.
But still, it was not worth pursuing me from the station itself.
Pursued from the station?
Me?
No?
I just saw you in the alley and wanted to surprise you.
So...
It turned out...
Okay, bring Rintaro somehow.
Let's have a heart-to-heart talk.
Bye.
Hey!
I'm telling you, it's not true!
What are you talking about, Mustafa?
Akarin!
What happened?
Nothing.
A false alarm.
Oh, Hiyaj!
Did I get fat or did you get less from our last meeting?
What do you think is more likely?
Yes, with every minute I get more and more lollies.
Maybe we should go for a walk?
I don't know.
I doubt it.
From this moment on, I will call her Mahatana.
The man said, the man did!
What are you talking about?
Madeus?
Yeah.
He says you don't pick up the phone no matter how many times she calls.
And judging by the expression on your face, you're doing it on purpose.
Yeah.
Let me talk to the professor.
It was a test after all.
You don't have to help.
You don't even get paid.
Well...
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Well...
I couldn't even imagine that Kurisu took up so much space in your life.
But I told you that Kurisu and I...
I can see it myself.
She was important to you.
And that's why you're projecting your feelings to her, to Amadeus.
Her voice revives memories and breathes new life into you.
And awakens past feelings.
But Amadeus is just a system.
Memories in a digital form.
To experience this feeling.
I know.
But...
But...
It's still a memory of Kurisu.
Okabe.
I know everything.
And that Kurisu is gone.
And that it's just a system.
But...
Even so...
Please give me more time.
Akarin, what are you going to do for the New Year?
Are you having a party again?
Yeah.
We're all going to the temple.
We'll have a festive dinner and wish each other happiness in the New Year.
Well, that sounds great.
Really?
I'll ask the others later.
Ok.
Mayusha is going shopping.
To Komi-ma?
Yeah.
To buy something for Ibuki's costume.
She needs a couple of accessories.
I see.
The holiday is coming soon.
When it's over, the year will follow.
It will be like one moment.
Like one moment.
Interactive training simulator.
Toilet.
How long?
I lived through it again and again.
But this year will end soon.
Woohoo!
It's snowing!
How long will it take?
Time is passing.
The time I chose.
Akarin!
I'm going!
Yeah, sure.
Oh, by the way,
I think Roku wanted to talk to you about something.
Oh, I completely forgot that he called me.
I'll call him back.
Yeah, say hi.
I'll call you later.
Maybe he's busy.
Maybe he's helping to decorate the temple for the New Year.
May I come in?
Rukako?
Is it open?
Thank God you're here.
Sorry.
I completely forgot about your call.
I was just trying to call you back.
Ibuki.
Yes?
I was just trying to call you back.
Don't worry.
So you wanted to talk to me?
Yes.
To be honest, I...
Well, to be honest,
I want you to meet someone.
That's why I'm not alone.
Is that okay?
Meet someone?
Ko!
That's Ko.
I'd call him Ko ago.
Why?
What's the matter?
Don't be afraid.
Remember?
Do you know anything?
Oh, yes.
It seems so, but her voice is different.
It's probably just a coincidence.
Anyway.
So, who's the ug Oke?
Oke?
Sorry, that's how I call him.
iri me because he's a nice woman.
So Gisele said Gisele would say it.
Yость, and the others.
Rolling.
Rolling.
The loose ones.
I think I've already told you that my father's guest has been living here for the last few days.
Oh, so it's her.
Yes. My father's friend brought her with him.
What's your name?
That's exactly what I wanted to talk about.
Well, do you think we can do something to find out who she is?
What do you mean?
The thing is, she has amnesia.
Her name, where she was born, how she lost her memory. She doesn't remember anything.
Are you serious?
I thought you might know how to get her memory back.
You always talk about brain memory and all sorts of complicated things.
At least something.
I just want to remember who I am.
Wait a minute.
I don't know what I'm saying, but I'm not an expert.
Besides, it's not that easy to get her memory back.
One thing is to save her, but then...
So that's how it is.
Then maybe there's a way to find out where she was born?
I really feel sorry for Kana.
Kana? What's that?
If she doesn't remember her name, it means it's Kana.
That's what my father said.
You could say that.
It doesn't matter.
It's just a temporary name.
What's more important?
Maybe you have some kind of a clue?
Well, like a certificate or a phone?
Nothing like that.
Nothing?
How did you even live?
There's one thing that can help.
Kana?
Yes.
Here.
I'm home.
The snow is over.
Oh? Guests?
It's...
Wow! It's Upa!
Hey, where did you get her?
Kana only remembers that she was always with her.
But she used to be more green, right?
Maybe it's a version of the Forest Fairy.
The Forest Fairy?
Yes.
She appeared in a recent movie.
See? It's like my Upa, but with a different design.
It has wings.
But why does she look so old?
If she's from a new movie?
I'm home.
Hey!
Are you okay?
Hey!
Kagari!
You're Kagari!
Shina Kagari, it's you!
