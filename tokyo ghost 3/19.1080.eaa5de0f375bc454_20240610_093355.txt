What's the point in everything we've been doing before?
Where are you going?
I'd like to know myself.
Since I don't have to do anything, I'm going to go.
I'm going to go.
I'm going to go.
I'm going to go.
I'm going to go.
I'm going to go.
I'm going to go.
I'd like to know myself.
Since I can't even take it back, I'm in the dead of it.
I have nowhere to go.
You are free now.
You and me...
we're still alive.
Only our lives are whatever.
Feel it, I can feel it.
Feel the emptiness?
Yeah.
I'm scared.
I...
...will stay with you.
You won't escape this time.
According to the data we got from the third base,
the local ghouls have become more active in killing pigeons.
Let's hurry.
I know what you're feeling,
but we're not going to be able to save all the ghouls, Your Majesty.
It's a massacre.
It's a massacre.
It seems that it's no longer safe for us to stay on the surface from now on.

Tokyo Ghouls Rebirth
Are you a child?
Episode 19. Uzu. Proof.
Huh?
I'm asking. Are you a virgin?
What are you talking about?
Well, it's all clear.
I could do it with you.
Wait.
That means...
Look.
I won't let them stay unpunished.
I'll destroy the ghouls and all of them together
and create an ideal world.
This is the third base.
We need to hurry to the 24th district.
Touka.
There's already a lot of people there.
But while we're sitting here, the others...
You want to get back at yourself again?
We have Yoma, Nishiki and Tsukiyama,
and the whole Aogiri tree.
Put yourself on your friends.
I'm always trying to hold you back somehow.
But you seem to be the only one who can do it.
You're the only one who thinks it's okay to just disappear.
That's normal.
Wait.
Was that conversation meant for this?
For what?
When you were a pigeon,
you would often look into this cafe,
open a book and look at me.
I immediately recognized that look.
That's how you looked at Rizu.
I'm such a fool.
I'm even more of a fool.
I was happy about that.
Sensei.
Motsuki?
You've finally found me.
Sensei, come back.
I'll do anything for you.
I'll be right back.
I'll be right back.
Motsuki.
We found it.
Sensei, come back.
I'll do anything I can.
Mochiki...
I can't.
This place stinks of ghouls.
You really betrayed us.
CCG...
Kuinksev...
And me.
What did we do to you?
Mochiki...
Sensei just got confused.
I'll get rid of all obstacles on our way.
Mochiki!
It's Sensei's voice!
CCG on Kuinksev?
Kaneki!
What a rude visitor!
Die, cat thief!
You...
You, you, you, you, you!
You...
You...
I hate women!
I'll kill her!
I'll kill her!
I'll kill her!
Should we follow her?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Detective Suzy.
Director calling for you.
I'm taking a walk.
Will you join the company?
I'll join you.
It smells just like that time.
A battle with a owl in the 20th district?
Yes.
A lot of blood will be spilled.
I wonder what the world is like.
What world?
People and pain.
If one of them disappears,
will there be peace?
I'm happy with how things are going now.
What is it, Kuraiba?
Invitation?
For a wedding?
Isn't it peaceful right now?
The sun shines on the blue horizon
It's just another day
I look out at the dimly lit buildings
And think of you
Am I imagining you here right next to me?
Your eyes catch my eye
I look back fleetingly
Before I realize you're really there
I dreamed you'd be beside me
That we would meet again
Your eyes glisten, your tears are falling
I know you have not forgotten the past
That we shared as I quietly watched you wipe your tears away
Although I found you, I know this meeting will not last
I have to let go, continue finding your way
Though I will miss you
It's time to wake from this dream
The End
Congratulations!
Congratulations!
These are my parents.
My treasure. I give it to you.
Thank you. I will always think of you when I look at it.
Let's go back to District 24. Everyone's waiting for us.
Yes.
So, did you find anything, Hitori?
You don't have to underestimate my connections, Kazai is underground now.
District 24?
Yes.
I'm sure they're just going to destroy them.
Who knows? But it will be interesting to see how it happens.
Let's take over the VIP seats at the next presentation.
Right.
You sure are a fruitful director.
You're overestimating me.
I decided to put an end to this small quarrel.
What do you lack to win?
The last boss.
Something terrible that will bring these peace-loving fools to their senses.
Or the last boss.
And who will he be for?
For Guli or CCG.
They will be on my side.
I've prepared a completely different enemy.
A dragon that would finish off Yashimura with one blow, and Arimu Kisho.
Did you call me, Director?
Kuroiwa Takeomi, I'd like to ask you something.
Yes.
But first, let's talk.
Paragraph 1, Article 88.
Those who conceal or conceal Guli will be severely punished.
Up to the death penalty.
Yes.
Well, concentrate on this and follow me.
District 24, Kazoo Base.
Urie.
What happened?
It turned out that the best friend of Yoriko, with whom she studied, was Guli.
Is that true?
Yoriko says she didn't know.
But she can't prove it.
Kaneki.
Kaneki.
Kaneki.
Kaneki.
Kaneki.
How are things with CCG?
They are desperately looking for the king.
They realized that this was the fastest way to end the conflict.
Maybe we should do the same and deal with their leader.
You don't plan to die here underground, do you?
Did you think about your child?
A child?
Crap.
I didn't say anything.
Forget it.
Touka!
Touka!
What?
How are you?
Again?
No!
I'm not...
I mean, yes, but...
How do you feel lately?
Let me think.
Sometimes my legs get tired.
What else?
I'm tired.
What else?
My hair is messed up.
What else?
Why are you asking?
No, nothing.
I'm...
pregnant.
I don't know if I can bear it.
I wanted to tell you when I would know for sure.
I was going to keep quiet until then.
I'm sorry.
And when is the deadline?
In December.
Is that so?
I'm very happy about it.
Really?
Yes.
Touka, are you going to marry Agulia?
What are you talking about?
I wanted to know how Agulia was doing.
What's the difference now?
We've already done it.
Maybe I don't want to tell anyone.
Why?
We're leaving a mark.
A mark?
Yes.
On each other's bodies.
The mark of the bite.
It's so deep that it won't disappear even after death.
I want to help her.
Yoriko.
Takiomi's wife.
And my friend who bakes delicious bread.
We can't.
It's an order.
We can only obey.
You're so senseless.
His decision will not change.
You're useless.
What?
Have you already left the last brain in your swing?
You're all strange.
Yes.
I don't want to see the pain of paradise either.
Kuroiwa.
That's enough. I'm leaving.
I'm not going to be a...
not going to be a terrorist.
You're not afraid of her.
CCG has become a bunch of killers.
And I don't want to stay here anymore.
You're not afraid of her.
I know we can't do anything about it.
Kuroiwa.
I'm sorry.
You're right.
CCG has become a bunch of killers.
Everyone has lost the desire to fight.
We're all paralyzed.
You're right.
We have to fight.
The least I want is for us to be considered criminals.
But how?
I'll think of a way.
What if he's not?
If that's the case,
we'll become terrorists.
Let's dance until morning, Misha.
Get off me, you're drunk.
You're my friend.
You're my friend.
Get off me, you're drunk.
That's great.
I didn't think we could have a wedding underground.
Tsukiyama said it was mandatory.
And we prepared everything.
It looks like he can be useful sometimes.
