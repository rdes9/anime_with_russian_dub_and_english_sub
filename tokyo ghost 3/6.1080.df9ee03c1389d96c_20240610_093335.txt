Hi, sir.
You...
That's how...
You are...
Call me by my name.
But...
If I pronounce it...
I...
I will...
I will...
I will...
I will...
I will...
I...
I hear...
Steps...
We arrived!
And we flew away!
What a cute scene!
Maybe we should play?
Your reply will be...
like this...
I don't want to die.
I really do.

Episode 6
Behind the screen
Two hundred. Two hundred million. Where are you? My two hundred million!
Psyko, cover me!
What does that even mean?
No! Don't jump!
From above!
She can separate her kaguna and use it as a trap. Be careful with the ceiling and walls.
She can do that too. But then...
Useless. I don't have enough strength.
The investigator is not afraid of her. Help me!
What does that even mean?
It was close. They almost made me a woman.
Damn!
This kaguna...
Maybe...
That's what I thought.
So...
My tongue is getting to your heart!
Kuri!
Kuri!
Kuri!
The woman no more!
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!
More. More. More. more. MORE!
How fun!
What is it?
My head is filled with me.
Because I'm damn strong!
So here's the fourth frame.
I see, you're completely crazy.
And now!
Well, now!
Well, now!
Well, now!
Well, now!
Well, now!
Well, now!
Well, now!
Well, now!
Well, now!
Well, now!
Well, now!
Well, now!
Damn, dessas!
sudden動画
What are you doing?
You damn bastard!
Who are you after?
What the hell?
Wait...
Ah!
Take this!
Take this!
Wait!
Iarna!
I want the assault on pendulum!
laissez-moi.
Why am I the only one who's not lucky?
It's not fair.
Why isn't it Kuroiwa?
Why am I the only one?
Father...
Why?
I'm trying so hard.
Sasaki...
Everyone in this house hates me.
Sasaki, I'm just an abuser.
I hate you all so much.
You'll all die.
You'll all die.
Uri.
Motsuki.
Kagune.
Uri.
Being alone is painful and very scary.
It's all right.
You're not an abuser.
It's all right.
Motsuki.
I see.
Then you...
I see.
Now I'm going crazy.
I won you at the auction.
You'll come with me.
I'll cut this dog into pieces
and eat it.
Juzo.
Hi.
Mom.
Come on, Saiko.
We need your power.
But...
First, I need to catch my paw.
Shirazu, you're not ready yet?
Saiko.
The thing is, I can't.
Sasan says she doesn't realize yet,
but Saiko has a huge potential.
That's right. Sasan.
Saiko.
What?
Let's get rid of her and run to save Sasan.
Otherwise...
Sasan will die.
Mom.
Yes, Saiko.
Please.
Hey, Shima.
I'm sorry.
I'm almost at my limit.
Thank you. We're ready.
Next.
We'll act according to the plan.
The principle of Kaguna's work
is quite simple.
He reacts to movement
and pierces...
Saiko!
Mom!
On the road!
You nasty slavs!
What does my guard do?
Juzo, Reishik,
don't listen to your mom!
I raised you.
Do you hate me?
Am I right?
I'm sorry, bastard.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
I'm sorry for the wounds.
Juzo!
We've captured the control room.
Good job.
Start transmitting the data.
Yes, sir.
Let's go.
They pay twice as much
for a particularly dangerous party.
And while I have money,
how much do you cost?
I want...
money.
Then I...
will become...
beautiful.
He speaks like a...
human.
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
I've always had only
scars from you.
They remind me of the past.
It doesn't matter
what others say about you.
I've never been
mean to you.
Little bitch,
I'll tell you something.
I left you
because you were
beautiful, degenerate.
Don't get me wrong.
I never loved you.
Your ears.
Goodbye.
The End
Did you know
there's a huge distance
between the first and the second?
The difference between
the hundred and ninety-nine
is not even one.
I thought I could see
you,
the real
Doctor Kano.
But where is he now?
The End
Weakling!
Weakling!
Weakling!
Weakling!
Weakling!
Wait.
Did they compare me
to you?
Sasaki.
No.
Kaneki.
No.
That voice...
Sasan!
Mom!
Mom!
Great!
Thanks to
the person who did it.
I came up with
something interesting.
I'll make holes in you.
And all your friends
will be able to hear
your screams.
I turned off the microphone.
Your investigator.
Who did Sasaki meet?
Answer!
Your investigator!
Thanks to the filming
from the control room,
I have a new
instruction for all units.
Commander, what to do with the sound?
It's an obstacle.
Don't worry.
Yes!
Let the Sasaki investigator
win us some more time
until we put the checkmate.
So many screams,
but no one came.
I'm sorry,
but that's where
you work.
They'll take advantage of you
and throw you out like garbage.
You're empty.
The sausage in which
they didn't add meat.
You simply don't exist.
Give me a reason
to disappear.
I don't want to
disappear.
Come on.
You'll be my dessert.
Come on.
Why are you
getting in my way?
My darling.
He can still come in handy.
Come back to the rabbit,
Takizawa.
It's up to me.
Brother.
Even if you're
empty.
Or just a vessel.
Even if you don't recognize me.
If it's just an empty vessel
for your soul.
I'll protect it.
I won't let you
fight alone anymore.
I will protect it.
I will protect it.
I will protect it.
Ouch!
You're strong,
Hina.
You hurt me.
Let me have some fun!
Ayato, this is bad! The pigeons are coming right here!
I know.
Help Ayato, Naki!
Leave the eastern side to the clowns and get out of here!
Damn it!
He left me alone to deal with Fueguchi.
So this is the power of the owl.
Go away! Go away!
I'm not going to eat this! I'm not going to eat this!
Brother, I'll protect you.
That's enough. I'm not the same person you used to know.
Even if it's the body of Kaneki Ken, I'm Sasaki Haisa.
Brother, he's not just an owl.
Even without memories.
He's still Kaneki Ken.
Let me disappear, but give me the strength to protect them.
Kaneki!
Haisa, are you afraid of me?
Yes.
Why?
Because you're strong.
And there's a void inside me.
I'm very afraid she'll swallow me.
A huge hole.
And loneliness inside her.
I can't win.
I can't win you.
I don't even know who controls this body anymore.
I'm just going to disappear.
I'm losing consciousness.
Listen, Haisa.
I'm not strong at all.
Look at me.
Remember.
I'm Kaneki Ken.
Please.
Don't wash me.
Looks like...
you were afraid too.
Okay.
I...
will save you!
Kaneki!
