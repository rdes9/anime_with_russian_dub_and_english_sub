They hide in the dark and feed on human blood.
They look indistinguishable from people, but in fact, they don't look like them at all.
We'll call them...
Guli.
We are about to destroy the Aogiri.
Their base is located in the Takis Bay.
During this battle, many of us will die.
However...
Takizawa!
As long as they exist, we can forget about the real world.
That was close.
Then let's restore order.
The main commander will be Arima Kisho.
I will coordinate you from here.
So...
It's time to destroy the Aogiri tree.
Now! Attack!
Looks like it's all bad.
Yes.
Almost all of our 23 prepared defenders have fallen.
Seriously?
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.
I'll do the same.
Do what you want.
Get out of here.
You're so kind, Tartar.
Okay.
See you later, Tartar.
Yes.
See you.
To be continued...
If Takatsuki-san is a ghoul,
and you knew about it,
then you're under Article 119 of the Aogiri Tree.
The people who read this article are sentenced...
to death.
Did you find out everything?
Yes.
I suppose he realized that there was too much evidence.
It's always better to save your skin.
Where are you going?
I still have to deal with paper work.
What a workaholic.
It's a pity it won't pay off.
By the way, what about Fuguchi?
Her sentence will be announced in a couple of days.
I see.
Takatsuki-san?
Really?
Is that her?
I'd like to make a statement today.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I...
I...
How old are you?
Fourteen.
To write such horrors at your age?
Maybe you'll try something fun?
It hurts, fool!
Look where you're going!
Are you an idiot?
Find the one who wrote it!
Yes!
And what do I do now?
Wait!
Wait!
Why did you leave without leaving your contacts?
Because I don't have them.
I see.
Do you need something?
I was born to make you a first-class author!
What's your name?
It's...
Yoshimura...
It's...
Mr. Yoshimura, please make your decision.
Who did it better?
Of course I did better.
Stop dreaming!
Of course I did better!
You were dreaming!
Mr. Yoshimura, if that's the case...
Shut up!
Sensei!
Takatsuki Sensei!
I'm coming in.
I brought your beloved...
She's asleep.
Then I'll put everything in the fridge.
Shion!
I'm coming in.
You've become so pale.
The best world for people of Iguly.
The world where people of Iguly can coexist.
That's my sacred wish.
What a world.
What did she come up with?
I showed her feelings like mine, born in this world.
I've already written it down as a word of encouragement.
I really hope that my words will reach the hearts of Guli and the people.
Takatsuki, wait! One more question!
Please! Please, wait!
Do you really believe in him?
I ask for a small interview!
Answer a couple more questions!
Back off!
Sensei, please!
This...
You did everything you could. Now live your own life.
Sorry for causing you trouble.
Takatsuki sensei...
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
Shion, raise your head.
I have nothing to blame you for.
Maybe it's not the first grade, but you've definitely made a good author out of me.
Once again.
Takatsuki-san, no, Yashimura Eto.
You're under arrest on suspicion of being Guli.
What beautiful eyes you have, boy.
Many believe that she said that at the press conference.
Only to attract attention.
But in my opinion, there is a deeper meaning here.
She fooled us.
We get hundreds of calls a day.
That's what I call a social resonance.
Well, what has a beginning will have a end.
Oh, by the way, about her last work.
A lingerie is one of Odin's names.
The one who lacks an eye.
In other words, it's a tribute to the one-eyed king.
In this book, my attention was attracted by the human organization.
It was definitely written off from your clan.
It says that this organization works with Guli.
It's a lie.
You're late, Nemura.
I'm sorry, I read it.
I heard that you caught the one-eyed king.
Right.
She's actually a one-eyed king.
The probability is high.
Don't weaken the defense.
Besides, we now know the location of Shachi.
I'll give it to you.
He should tell you where Reiza is.
Why did you write it?
To tell people the truth.
Your collaboration with Guli.
Have you ever heard of V?
V?
It's a group of people who believe that they belong to the whole world.
Yours and yours alone?
Yes.
And you?
Yes.
And you?
Yes.
And you?
Yes.
Why didn't Ersi and Vrata react to you?
Because I'm half Guli, half a person.
No, they were obliged to work.
The thing is, they didn't react.
They didn't react.
They didn't react.
They didn't react.
They didn't react.
They didn't react.
What?
That they don't react to Ersi's cell of certain Guli.
I'm sorry.
Guli who belong to V.
In addition to people of yours, V was my father, Kuzen.
I am his daughter.
And also, Rize's fianc√©, the woman who caused everything.
Gull ran away from Vy.
Ryza.
Stupid, what are you doing?
I ran away from Nils.
I see, but you can't just lie here.
I'm hungry.
Well.
Girl, what's your name?
Ryza, and you?
Shachi.
Shachi.
Listen, Shachi.
Are you my father?
Shachi Husuk, we came to kill you.
The white god of death.
Looks like my time has come.
These movements.
This feeling.
Is it really him?
Where is Ryza?
This is the duty of a father to protect his daughter.
The white god of death.
And you are a worthy opponent.
As I thought, your weakness is in your eyes.
That's all.
Ryza, run.
Since I wrote for Gull, I could choose simpler words.
Banjo, what are you reading there?
Takatsuki-san, Ryza liked it so much.
Of course not.
But it's for the best.
Since she is Gull, this book will touch many.
How?
She wants the appearance of a one-eyed king.
Who?
Relax.
And me?
Mr. Ayato.
Why are you here?
Isn't Aguirre supposed to be on the island of Rusima now?
I came to talk.
Really?
Hello.
You are as always beautiful, Takatsuki-sensei.
Shut up, you fool.
Looks like you know everything.
Well?
Why did you come?
Are you a one-eyed king?
When the world is on the verge of collapse,
the one-eyed king will appear and bring people.
Do you think the best way to control the masses and use power is?
If you beat around the bush, you will cause complete chaos.
We select specific goals.
Anyone can be this goal.
Famous, terrorist, journalist, anyone.
This way you can gather a crowd and make these fools think that their opinions are important.
That's why.
You, your one-eyed king, are breaking the established order.
Well, now I'm calm.
I'm glad you couldn't find out anything about the one-eyed king.
Shion was a good man.
I tried very hard to cook it well.
I hope you like it.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Hey, Vashu.
The king is already inside you.
What do you think?
To be useless garbage?
What do you think?
To be useless garbage that can't call its father a father?
Die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die.
It's scary.
Hey, will that be enough?
Yeah.
I'm sorry, Banjo.
We're assaulting a cock.
That's how you can create a crowd and make these fools think that their opinions are important.
That's why. You and your one-eyed.
I deserve your trust, baby.
Or not?
Can I ask?
What is it?
Why would you risk your life for nothing?
If your message is not understood, people and ghouls will never stop fighting.
I don't think it was all in vain.
You want to say it was worth it?
Who knows?
I did it just because I wanted to.
I think it was worth it.
But don't tell me you haven't met those who think the same.
Do you want me to help you with your business?
Do you want to say you understand what I'm thinking?
Do you understand?
Yes.
But instead, do what I ask.
You have to kill the one-eyed king.
Is that a cuckoo?
Yes.
It's the first time I've seen it so close.
It's awful.
Well, how are we going to get inside?
We'll break through there with our strength.
A riot?
Shut up!
Damn it!
Everyone, go!
All the bosses, we're being attacked!
I repeat, we're being attacked!
It's started.
Brother...
I'm sorry it took so long.
Let's get out of here.
We can do it!
Yes.
I'm so sad.
But I...
Really?
Next episode.
White whisper.
