CCG...
It was that...
I'm going to die here.
P-Please...
Can I...
Please...
Can I take her and keep an eye on her?
P-Please...

THE END
On November 11,
CCG successfully completed two operations.
Cleaning the auction
and protecting the transport with steel for the client.
We received information that the Aogiri tree was planning to steal.
And we were able to prepare for the attack.
The head of the operation, Maruda Itsuki,
head of the S-3 detachment.
Immediately after the start of the auction,
the Aogiri tree was attacked by the convoy.
However, the S-3 successfully repelled their attack.
Soon the S-3 detachment arrived at the place of the auction.
It's time for us to go.
Fuji Kosuke, a special class investigator.
Divide and leave!
Hinami is still inside!
There are too many of them!
What about me?
Matsumae,
we'll have to find another way.
Yes, Mr. Miruma.
Takizawa?
It's Mado.
For the information about the auction,
the destruction of the clicker,
the Big Madam,
and the help of the Suzui detachment,
Kuinksov was rewarded for their service,
and new official titles were assigned to them.
One of them attacked the Aogiri tree's running members.
But the body of Guli was found to be traces of cannibalism.
If Takizawa survived,
could he?
No.
Takizawa,
I'm waiting...
I'm waiting...
Episode 7.
In my memories.
Shirazu Genshi,
Yonebayashi Saika.
You have the titles of the second class.
Mikago Miyuki,
Tamaki Mizuro,
Abara Hanbe,
Kuroi Watakiomi,
Mutsukito Uru.
You have the titles of the first class.
Wow, they've increased.
Ito Kuramoto,
Nakarai Keiji,
Hayashimura Naoto,
Sasaki Haisa.
You have the titles of the senior investigators.
Senior investigator Mado Akira.
You have the titles of the special class candidate.
Suzuya Juzo,
Vashu Matsuri.
You have the titles of the special class candidate.
So you, Prince Uri, are now the first class?
You're like Sasan in the past.
I still can't believe it.
Uri,
congratulations.
Thank you.
He killed Gouli with bare hands?
And what's wrong with that?
Don't come near me.
Takeomi!
Investigator Kuroiwa.
Kuroiwa Iwao,
special class investigator.
Investigator Uri.
What a young senior investigator.
Congratulations.
Thank you very much.
Special class candidate Mado Akira.
Enough.
I'm embarrassed.
By the way,
how is Fueguchi?
We continue to interrogate her.
She gave us a lot of information,
but you spend too much time with her.
Fueguchi is involved in the death of Akira's father.
And the fact that I took her under my watch
in the eyes of Akira
looks like I'm pouring oil into the fire.
I am me,
and you are you.
But we have only one body.
Please, Heise,
next time
be happy.
Investigator Shimaguchi.
We are members of your squad,
starting from this day.
I am investigator Satomi Shion.
Hello.
Investigator Togamiha.
Nice to meet you.
I know.
In my squad,
don't expect anything good.
We don't know.
I don't care.
Research Center CCG.
The shinko is almost ready.
It should be waiting.
From it will come out a similar queen.
More.
More.
I won't lose to Kuroiwa.
And while these knives are still in the air,
you hit those that are in your hands,
and during the fight you pick up those that are thrown.
It's a little difficult for me.
I think my limit is two.
Really?
But Toru, you're so good with knives.
Suzuha,
aren't you afraid to hurt your knives?
Of course not.
I have a high pain threshold.
Are you afraid?
In battle, the one who controls his weaknesses wins.
Controls weaknesses?
That's easy to say.
That's what my mentor taught me.
Thank you very much.
Yeah, we did a good job.
Detective Soshaki.
Detective Takagi.
Thank you.
When the acting detective comes to the lecture,
it motivates the students.
You can call me anytime.
Not students, but a bunch of fools.
No, I'm not.
I'm not.
I'm not.
I'm not.
I'm not.
I'm not.
I'm not.
A bunch of fools.
No, they're very cheerful.
I have some notes in my notes.
By the way, how's Mutsuki doing?
I hope he's not causing any trouble.
Not at all.
He's very responsible.
Detective Suzuha is teaching him now.
Ah, Suzuha.
I have to go.
I have to go.
I see.
So the detective, who loved Guli,
has the right to him?
I think the clicker will be a strong one.
And the better he is,
the more chances he has against strong Guli.
I see.
You're right.
Welcome back.
How was your day?
Was it fun?
Did you get hurt?
No.
Well, wash your hands and get changed.
We have a special guest today.
Take care.
Sensei, did you have fun?
We have a party tonight.
You two help me out.
Right away.
Got it.
Right away.
It's burning.
It's called Flambe.
Where are you going, Uri?
To practice.
I'm not going to lose, Kurayvi.
But we have guests.
I don't care.
Uri!
Go to the store.
I'm sorry, Uri.
Was it hard?
No.
There was a package for you.
Interesting.
I told you to tie up with your Flambe, Saiko.
I'm sure I can do it this time.
Sensei!
Oh my God!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Thank you for your help, people.
Good evening, gentlemen.
Hello.
Welcome back.
I mean, welcome.
Arima and Akira.
Delicious!
Here it is!
The moment when we have to talk to him.
Akira, I made curry.
Thank you.
I made it the way you like it.
It perfectly reflects the taste of the Mado family.
Delicious.
It brings back memories.
Let me try.
Wait.
I wouldn't recommend it.
Astrata Kari Mado
refers to the SS Class.
Uri!
How are you, Prince Uri?
I'm weak.
Oh my.
Did you hit Gula with an umbrella?
Well, I didn't have a quinka.
But it turned out to be an umbrella.
Arima's investigator has a lot of rumors.
Juzo said that he even fell asleep in the middle of the fight.
Come on!
It's a bit too much.
I'm tired.
My stomach is full.
I'm full too.
We'll find a place for dessert.
You're not full yet?
I have something for all of you.
Are you sure?
Yeah, we're celebrating.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Akira, and for you.
A gift in honor of promotion.
Thank you, Haise.
You're really like a father to them.
You think so?
Arima, and this is for you.
But I haven't been promoted.
You often help me.
Thank you.
I'll keep it.
It looks like that's it.
Uriel.
Uriel, where are you going?
To train.
At night?
Don't overdo it.
Stop acting like a father.
The load is getting bigger.
That means Yaguli's tasks will be much more dangerous.
You can't relax.
You're right, but...
Don't try to do it all by yourself.
Teamwork helps.
Teamwork helps to block Breshe in defense.
Yeah.
Nonsense.
Although...
Chieftain is right.
A mask and an eye patch?
Kanekiken.
How is it written?
How did he write his name?
Takatsukisen, hanged by Magafin.
Takatsukisen.
Kanekiken from Takatsukisen.
Kanekiken.
The book of Takatsukisen.
And this mask.
Who's the sender?
I'm sure it's not a mistake.
The address is written on the mask.
It somehow has something to do with Kanekiken.
Should I look for the sender?
Thank you.
I wonder why...
Why do I know this scent?
Coffee, please.
I'll take it myself.
Thank you.
What the hell, Nishigen?
Uta.
What did the clowns think?
What are you going to do about Ken?
Who knows?
The boss doesn't tell us anything.
What are you planning?
Are you going to wait for Kaneki?
Or...
Uta.
I'm just going to do what I decided.
Yes.
Thank you.
Your coffee is still the best.
But...
For me...
He's still a special client.
Your readings are normal.
Really?
I heard you almost lost control.
Who told you, old man?
How could you calm down?
Concentration helps me keep control.
I know.
About...
Mutsuki.
What is it?
I can't reveal personal information.
It's okay. Forget it.
I doubt the doctor knows.
Excuse me.
Right away?
Haru.
Your brother has been promoted.
Isn't that great?
And the salary has been promoted.
Well...
Now there's going to be more money.
Just wait.
Don't worry.
I won't be in a hurry.
Besides, my friends help me.
They're all very cool.
Uri and Toru, for example,
have been promoted.
Well...
I'll introduce you one day.
They're great guys.
Don't worry.
You're a beauty, Haru.
In the CCG, there are no documents on Ken's Kaneki.
Even somehow weird.
Only records of the incident
with the collapse of some steel beams
and data about the fact that he disappeared.
He was a student
of the direct relatives of the famous
He was a student. He doesn't have any direct relatives.
What about his friends? Were they there?
Anteiko.
What is this?

It hurts.
I'm so hungry.
