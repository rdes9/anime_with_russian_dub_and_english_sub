Let me help you, gentlemen.
Who the hell are you?
Gourman. S rank.
Is he after us?
I don't know.
Stop! You don't know him?
No.
Who are you?
That's what I thought.
Let me remind you, Mr. Naki,
with my blade.
Unlike Mr. Naki,
I have a great memory.
And I remember the debt you owe me.
As I owe you.
That's the goal of all this hunting on the Aogir.
Snake, S-rank.
That's what I need, old man.
Is he an ally?
No.
What does he need?
There you go.
This is no shelter for lost children.
Could be for diversity and a couple of women.
Reinforcements.
This is a request from my dear soul.
So I won't give it to you, Uncle Nisho.
This tail needs to be taught by manners.
I guess that's what I'm going to do, Roma.
Where's Mutsuki?
I don't know.
Maybe he ate it.
I'll give it to you.
Gintui!
No.
No.
No.
You're finished.
Takizawa.
Takizawa?
Congratulations.
Detective Mada!
Back off.
Mada.
What...
What are you doing?
I'm protecting Gula.
It's a crime.
I tried to think logically.
But I failed.
I failed as a detective.
That's it.
Tell me.
Takizawa.
I can't forget.
I remember again and again.
If only I...
Hey, Mada!
Mada!
Aman.
She won't last long.
Take her away.
I'm going.
Take her away? Where?
To the dock.
There are allies there.
Aman, are you a fool?
Do you really think I'm going to save Mada?
I'm a murderer and a traitor.
I believe in you.
Aman.
Aman.
I don't think it's a good idea to save Kano.
I won't let you.
Don't you think you're in the minority?
Hurry up.
Kano is leaving.
Damn it.
Aman.
You're done for, kid.
Isn't it fun to watch the desperate...
Nishiki?
Aman.
I'll help you, four-eyed.
I'm Nishiki, you fool.
Higa!
Why do you need Detective Mada?
She...
has no place in the CCG.
Higa, how do you know?
They find us because you're noisy, gentlemen.
Oh, boy.
Great, old lady.
Are you okay?
No, I'm not okay.
Do you think it worked?
I didn't touch her, Kakuko.
You're so rude.
I'm a girl.
You're in the way.
Get out of the way.
Higa!
Go!
Yeah.
I'm stuck.
Get out of the way, board.
Thank you.
Yeah.
He's got a double-edged sword.
He's got a double-edged sword.
Yeah.
He's got a double-edged sword.
He's got a double-edged sword.
He's got a double-edged sword.
He's got a double-edged sword.
That means Nishiki still has the upper hand.
I don't want to.
I'm going home.
Nishiki.
Agree to fight.
It's pointless.
Well, no.
Hisao!
You're not afraid of her.
You're not afraid of her.
Commander.
You're right.
No.
It's our job.
You're not afraid of her.
You're not afraid of her.
I don't want to lose anyone else.
It's remote control.
It worked.
Commander, we're following the owl.
No, wait.
Something's wrong.
Attack!
It's not normal, Kakuna.
Damn it.
Third frame.
Take that.
Attack!
How do you like that?
Higemaru!
Higemaru.
Guys.
That's it.
You're not afraid of her.
You're not afraid of her.
That's it.
No one's going to die.
Mutsuki.
Let's go home.
Together.
I...
Commander.
I won't let you kill my friends.
What's wrong with you?
Why?
Why did you save me then?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Why?
Because
I thought it was right.
You're not afraid of her, right?
This world is not so simple.
What's good,
what's bad,
there's too little difference.
And so
you have to decide for yourself.
It's up to you whether you do it or not.
Maru.
What does it all mean?
It's not funny.
I decided to dig into Vashu's subordinate clan.
And?
The book hints that the Vashu clan cooperates with the Ghouls.
But that's not true.
Vashu doesn't cooperate with them at all.
They are Ghouls.
You pointed the gun at me without any evidence, Maru?
One of my friends said,
I've always hated that phrase.
It's nonsense.
Please.
Let it be an ordinary murder.
I'm sorry.
I'm disappointed in you, Maru.
You're a fool.
You can't get out of here.
You're mine, Hukuri.
Mine.
The clone SS-Range camera is open,
you overwatcher.
Corona.
Let's go.
Let's greet the king.
I've been waiting for this for so long.
It's my time.
It was already at the end.
I just got a little closer to the end.
Arima.
Listen,
the end is near.
Me and Haru,
just like Furuta,
the investigator,
chosen from the Sun Garden,
we're not humans.
We are
defective half-humans
whose veins are bleeding with Ghouls.
We are
defective half-humans
whose veins are bleeding with Ghouls.
My right eye,
I'm sure you noticed,
but it sees practically nothing.
Glaucoma.
A common disease
among the elderly.
The elderly?
Do you know what children from the Union
between a human and a ghoul are?
One-eyed ghouls,
half-ghouls.
Not all of them.
Most children
are almost no different from people.
Only two differences.
Their physical abilities are higher
and they live less.
One-eyed ghouls
are a rare exception.
We die earlier
than ordinary people.
My second eye
also began to fade.
My end
was already near.
I was hanging on the hair.
But...
But why?
Why are you...
Who knows?
I don't know, but...
Maybe
I just wanted to become
a human.
Yours.
Your clan?
CCG's top?
Ghouls?
Ghouls?
You'll find out the rest later.
I told him everything.
Dismissed.
What do you want me to do?
One-eyed king.
Kill him.
Tell me,
why did you kill me?
You...
One-eyed
king?
If a ghoul appears,
who killed Arima Kisho,
it
will give hope to another ghoul.
That's what I said.
One-eyed king,
we
created together with her.
The End
The End
Please.
It's by force.
Only to you.
Good.
I killed you.
Thank you.
I hated myself.
Because I could only take it.
Hey,
finally,
I was able to leave something behind.
The End
Thank you for watching.
The End
The End

The End
