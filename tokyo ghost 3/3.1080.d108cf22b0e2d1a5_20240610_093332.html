        <pre>Mr. Shu, take it.
Do you feel anything, Mr. Shu?
Nothing.
And yet, they seem so familiar to me.
Besides, they have a good design.
Mr. Shu, I feel so sorry for you.

How long has it been?
I don't feel any changes.
Well...
Allow me to increase my frame level.
Why go so far?
Just for the sake of a special class?
Stop asking. Just give me permission.
Arima? Kisho?
Kisho, Uria requests permission to increase the frame.
What do you think?
Why is he asking Arima?
Uria, do you realize the risk of this operation?
Yes.
Did the mentor agree?
Yes.
In that case, I don't see any problem.
I know him. He can handle such power.
Sam Arima Kisho recognized me.
Only I can handle it.
And I won't lose control like Sasaki.
Episode 3. Pure Eva.
Wow, Prince Uria is back from the hospital.
I haven't recovered yet.
So I won't go to work.
I understand.
Don't worry. Just lie here and have a rest.
We'll do everything ourselves.
Why are you touching me?
What's so funny?
Shirazu.
Yes.
What do you want me to do?
What happened?
Suzuya's squad determined the location of the clicker.
It sounds like I was wrong.
Joint operation with Suzuya's squad is tomorrow.
We can't let Saika stay in her room again.
Suzuya Juzo?
Let's go to her, don't be afraid.
Huh?
But how can we?
Wow.
A new lion's skull.
And titanium.
Great.
Someone's coming.
Two.
No.
Three.
Saiko, we know you're here.
Come out.
I'm in a shell.
I'm a snail.
Useless.
No choice.
Yes.
Kagan?
What are you doing?
I can't.
You can't either.
Why are you ignoring all our tasks?
Well, you know, that Uriel commander...
Now I'm the commander.
Did Uriel commander complain?
Did he do something?
Shut up.
It's none of your business.
It's the commander's order.
Hurry up.
Why?
On my complaint,
I can continue to hiccup.
So you realize that you're hiccuping.
Well, I'll come back.
Come on.
Get out of your cocoon.
Dad, don't touch me.
You're beautiful.
You're not afraid of her.
What's wrong with you?
You didn't know?
I heard the management is considering your dismissal.
Come on.
Your carefree life
is being paid off
from the CCG accounts.
Nobody needs
the useless spending of money.
In such a physical state,
you won't be able
to return to society.
It's a complete scum.
Idiot.
Read the contract carefully.
All the material support
is guaranteed even after dismissal.
What should I do?
Just do your job
until your dismissal
is confirmed.
That's it.
Just do my job?
Just do my job?
I'll just take it
and get rid of it.
Commander Shirazu,
a young boyish psycho
is here to serve you.
Oh, really?
That's great.
We're leaving tomorrow at 7.30.
Got it?
Don't oversleep.
Yes, sir. I'm going to sleep
right now and very quickly.
Kuri,
thank you for
helping to convince her.
Maybe you're pissing me off,
but you're cool.
I'm impressed, too.
But where was your enthusiasm
when you were the commander?
I was thinking about
my actions.
Now I know
how to make it even better.
And although not all of them have arrived yet,
let's get started.
As I thought.
It's impossible to just take
and make a psycho wake up in time.
She's like a gear
with the wrong thread.
If we work together,
we'll be able
to make a psycho
wake up in time.
It's like a gear
with the wrong thread.
If we work together,
we'll be able to make a psycho
wake up in time.
It's like a gear
with the wrong thread.
It's like a gear
with the wrong thread.
I'm late.
Good morning!
Candidate to the special class!
I'm here.
Juzo!
Aise!
Oh,
what I expected
from Aise!
Sorry, we're late!
Shirazu
and Saiko?
Sasan, sorry,
we're late!
No, no, it's all right.
Thank you very much for bringing Saiko with you.
Look at the paper.
This is the list of ingredients
found in Juzo's house.
Ingredients?
Juzo
steals people
for the purpose of further
auctions.
You said auctions?
The place where ghouls
are traded for people.
And the one who puts more
will eat?
Sometimes they make
pets.
Pets?
I'm sure
Ghouleses Ranga Big Madam
will be at the auction.
Considering this,
the second unit
can join the operation.
It looks like the investigation
is much more serious than I thought.
We are not often
joined by the second unit.
Detective Sasaki!
Ah,
to the doctor again.
Take care of yourself.
I'm sorry.
I wonder, is everything all right with him?
He says the level of the RC cells is unstable.
It's more complicated
than I thought.
So,
Torso ran away?
Even after your help.
I'm sorry.
It's all right. I don't care
what happened to him.
So,
what are you talking about?
Heise,
are your own memories
being torn apart?
There are two ideas
conflicting inside you.
You can't decide.
Do you want the memory to come back
or leave everything as it is?
I'm rephrasing the question.
If the memory
comes back to you,
what are you going to do?
Whatever happens,
you are still so impenetrable.
Why ask me about memories?
Because
they are interested
in another goal.
Another goal?
Yes.
Maybe
it will be the key
to your memory
and its name.
Guys,
we are all
going to be women.
Mr. Schuh
didn't feel anything.
Nothing?
No.
Throw away your stinky panties.
Really?
Hartnageek, roses can't lie.
And still,
who did this thing belong to?
Detective Pagulio.
Who is he?
Sasaki Heisei.
Experienced pig.
Maybe you were
Mr. Schuh's classmate.
But you are just a person.
Don't forget,
I can kill you at any moment.
Tsukiyama, right?
He is interesting.
Tomorrow
I invite you to dinner.
Answer me!
What do you see
in front of your eyes?
Hori,
listen.
I found
an extremely rare ingredient.
And as soon as
I get it,
I will tell you
about my impressions all night.
Hori,
answer me.
What is
delicacy?
I hope you will entertain me again,
Tsukiyama.
Hey,
no
with us.
Something wrong with me alone?
Shii, be quiet.
Watch your words.
Sasan, why are you looking so good?
Just don't think about it.
Taoru too.
And Saiko.
Oh, well.
What?
What to do?
In the list of clickers,
this is an operation
under cover.
Yes, but still.
Look, here it is.
Well, let's go.
Brother,
there will be a free minute.
Unreliable.
How do I attract
the tail?
Don't look.
Don't look, don't look,
don't look, don't look, don't look,
don't look.
Sensei.
Everything is fine. You look great.
Thank you.
It's not about that.
I'm worried.
It's all like needles.
Look,
a familiar face,
Roma.
Sister Niko,
isn't that the same Hoise?
He may look like a girl,
but still,
he looks like Kaneki.
That's for sure.
But,
aren't you angry
that he's so happy?
Yes.
Kaneki can be
on his own
only in despair,
while suffering and suffering.
Oh, my God.
You're so selfish.
I really want to
bring Kaneki back to his old,
poor cutie.
Well, does that mean Hoise
is going to die?
That's right.
Watching the spilled wine
is a wonderful sight.
If you
get your memory back,
what are you going to do?
If the memories
come back,
I...
Sasan,
look.
Oh,
you're not making a deal.
There's going to be a bunch of celebrities,
so you're going to find a couple.
Really?
That's great.
You've got a nice haircut.
Toru, what's he doing?
I'm looking for a job.
Mom,
I think he's gone too far with his clothes.
Sensei!
She just
offered me a job.
Let's continue our operation
under cover.
Well done, Toru.
And now dance.
Victory dance.
I'm with you.
Well,
even if the memory comes back,
and I'm not going to be
Sasaki Hoise's investigator anymore,
I don't want to
forget about you,
guys.
Investigator
Vashu Matsuri.
S2 brain unit.
A rationalist,
a victim.
One of those who negatively spoke
about the Queenx project.
When's the auction?
November 11th.
November 11th.
We're going to
put investigator Mutsuki in there.
Just one.
Just one?
Of course.
Besides, in case of a search,
he won't be able to take Queenx.
That's why we need Queenx.
Mutsuki has never been...
No buts,
Sasaki.
Investigator Vashu.
You can send me to the auction.
Investigator Suzu?
If there's an accident,
it's better to have
another person inside.
Okay.
Thank you very much.
Come in.
In this operation,
S2,
Suzu,
Hirako,
Mada,
and Shimoguchi,
we're all going to work together.
We're all going to work together.
I'm going to explain
the auction cleaning plan to you.
Investigator Shimoguchi,
are you feeling better?
Are you kidding me?
Leave him.
It's going to be the best
demonstration of concern.
In our work, there's no one
who wouldn't lose their bosses or subordinates.
That's the kind of people
CCG gathers.
Get stronger, Heise.
Get stronger and kill Guli.
The one who loses the most
is the one
who has the most power.
You don't want them to take away
what you have, do you, Heise?
That's how
our world works.
That's how we live.
Do you like to climb higher?
This one?
Ayato,
I have a message from Tatara.
He wants you to protect Big Madam
at the upcoming auction.
Who else?
You and your team,
Naki and also Misa.
Probably.
Thank you!
Saiki, are you coming too?
You deserve to gain experience.
Now our work
is going to be dangerous.
Okay, Ayato.
Duru.
Duru.
I dream about your cold soul.
Duru.
Don't stand there, block!
Don't let go!
Weapon!
You're just horrible.
Guli won't spare you.
Get up!
Duru!
Duru!
Duru!
Duru!
Duru!
Duru!
Duru!
Duru!
Duru!
Duru!

Guli won't spare you.
