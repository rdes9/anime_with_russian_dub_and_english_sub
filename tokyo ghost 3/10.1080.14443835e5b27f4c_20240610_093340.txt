This handsome boy! I'm going to kill him the next time we meet!
Definitely!
Hello there, Kanaya.
Who are you?
Gul?
No.
Strange smell.
Who is she?
Strange smell, right?
Gul, man, what do you think I am?
Guess what? I'm going to treat you to an apple.
Who are you?
You're the survivor of the Rodvaj family, aren't you?
How does she know?
You're making fun of me, little one!
I'm going to eat you too!
Where are you?
Are you going to eat me?
Aren't you going to give in?
One-eyed Gul?
Yes, that's right!
Are you full?
I wonder why the tree of knowledge put them in paradise?
Do you understand? It was logical to eat his fruit.
I realized that God is not an all-seeing father at all,
but a child with incredible power.
What are you talking about?
You see, the world is filled with broken things.
For example, you.
Despite all the effort, your master did not come to his senses,
but it was worth it only to appear from the Asaki Heisei,
as soon as he was able to regain his senses.
Do you want to see him die?
The death of Heisei.
It turns out that you didn't want the master to return to normal.
No! I'm worried about Mr. Ishura!
But he doesn't love you.
Shut up!
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
Stop it!
Mr. Ishura, I'm...
You're just an egoist.
I...
All you need is an apple.
Your life is in exchange for knowledge.
And then I'll be yours.
Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up!
The End
The End
Hey, wait, Prince Uri!
I told you not to fire me!
I will not follow your orders.
You can't even use the queen.
You only have an unfinished kaguna.
You can't fight.
Go away, you idiot.
Episode 10
Anxious
Hey, why are you throwing so hard?
Brother, my eye is itchy.
Let me see.
It looks like it jumped.
He will definitely pass.
Let's show it to the doctor.
Yes!
Good!
Ginn, brother
I want to be beautiful, just like a princess.
Money. I need money. I have to make money.
And to do that, I have to kill Guli.
I have to keep killing and killing to make money.
Oh, you're from the Sasaki squad, aren't you?
Mr. Foro.
Hi.
You can't use queens?
Well, it's not the first time in my practice.
It's normal for a novice.
Sasan. The Sasaki investigator said the same thing.
You know, I couldn't get used to the queens from my first killed Guli.
And how did you cope with that?
It's not going to be easy.
Repentance and guilt will bite you from the inside every day.
You will try to overcome them.
In the end, you will definitely come to the conclusion that will suit you.
I'm not so strong-willed, so time will pass quickly.
Listen, Shirazu.
I think that people who worry about their victims are much more humane than everyone else.
It doesn't matter that you're an investigator.
After all, our job is to take life.
We take someone else's life.
I rely on you.
Oh, Shirazu.
Well, how do you like the tick?
If you want, I can take it.
Kishimura.
Could you cut me?
Cut?
What happened, Shirazu?
Is something wrong with you?
I won't be angry, tell me.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I dragged you back.
I will become stronger as a commander.
Uri, thank you.
You helped me become more confident.
You're welcome.
How did it all come to this?
It turns out that there is a possibility that the rose and the tree of Aogiri are the same.
It's just a guess.
But there is a possibility that they will answer this video.
Oh, my God.
It seems that my video suddenly aroused great interest.
Unexpectedly.
The video only added problems to us.
Are you sure?
After all, this is a rare opportunity to learn more about the rose and the tree of Aogiri.
What if it's not a great result?
Investigator, I agree with Kijime.
If we win, there will be no problems.
Hiro.
Oh, I'm sorry.
This is not a puzzle, we need to continue the investigation without colliding with the enemy.
We just need to find out how strong the enemy is.
Investigator Ui, I ask you to reconsider the decision about my clan.
Investigator Sasaki, explain to the rest.
Yes, sir.
You are well in the image, Sasan.
Do you think?
How is the information collected?
Good.
We entered the 18th district, which is filled with the triple blade of Misa.
If things go wrong, we will be able to find out about the members of Aogiri.
I see.
Uri, do you have it?
We entered the 6th district, but all the meeting hooligans were under great security.
We need to continue the investigation.
After the incident with the rose, they became suspicious.
That's how it is.
They will not trust strangers.
What's wrong with you, Sasan?
The eye bandage!
They found out about my Gula mask.
I need to find out about it.
Aman Kotaro.
Aman Kotaro.
Aman Kotaro died during the execution.
But no one knows how.
Aman Kotaro died.
Agree or disagree.
Eye bandage.
Eye bandage.
I killed him.
It's my fault.
I killed him.
I killed Aman.
Alisa.
Mr. Shu.
I'm sorry.
They caught him because of me.
Mr. Shu, I...
I don't want to lose him.
I will do everything in my power to bring him back to his senses.
Bonjour.
Forgive me for that day.
I wanted to see you again.
Yes?
So I'm on time.
Are you Gula?
I'll ask you a different question.
Are you one of those who knew Kamekiken?
What should I do now?
I tried to find out as little as possible about myself.
But maybe this way I can comfort him.
And you don't care how it will affect your current life?
You're right.
I still want to be a human.
I can't accept Kamekiken, whom even Gula was afraid of.
I just want this life to never end.
But one day I'll have to remember.
It must be my destiny.
Please.
If you know anything, tell me.
I'm sorry.
I don't know anything anymore.
What should I tell you?
Could you die for the delicacy?
Hori, I think you already know that I can't die.
After all, I have too many precious things left.
I enjoyed what was in front of me.
It was always enough for me to live.
I liked it at that time.
Apparently, my little leak of information has completely bought itself.
What a pity.
You came all alone to save your friend.
But he died a long time ago.
What a pity.
But it doesn't give me the feeling that you turned out to be an unforgivable conversation for a servant.
What an innocent girl.
Unforgivable, innocent.
Tsukiyama Group is a company with a long history.
It is truly huge and has more than 20 subsidiary companies in different fields.
If this is the case, then the company will be very successful.
Please allow me to conduct a secret investigation into the Tsukiyama case and all subsidiary companies.
Good.
Investigator Lure, commander of the S-1 detachment.
You will command the operation to destroy the Tsukiyama family.
Yes, sir.
Investigator Vashu.
What can I do for you?
The S-2 detachment will help you.
Let me say hello.
I am appointed commander.
I am glad to work with you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Commander.
I am glad to work with you.
I have high hopes for you.
You will not get any praise for this, damn it.
You will get no praise for this, damn it.
You will get no praise for this, damn it.
You will get no praise for this, damn it.
Are you serious?
Akira.
What are you looking for?
I was looking for old documents.
The case of Amano Kotaro?
Yes.
He was my colleague.
And he died during the operation to destroy the owl.
Is there anything else you are interested in?
What about the eye bandage?
You should not know about him.
Why should I hide it?
Why should I not know?
Because I have an eye bandage.
It's because I killed Amano Kotaro.
Is it because of me?
Can you imagine how scary it is to wake up with a thought that you know nothing?
What do I feel because I remember so little?
Where did I come from?
Where did I come from?
Who am I?
Haisa.
I am not Haisa.
I am...
I am...
Haisa.
You.
It's you.
The name doesn't matter.
Yuma.
Kaneki.
Kanae.
Me.
Shu.
Dad?
I made you coffee.
Thank you.
You don't have to be so picky.
Yeah.
Your coffee is amazing.
It's so bright and...
Matsuma.
Yeah.
Watch out for Shu.
Tsukiyama Miruma.
You.
I'm not going to run away or resist.
Because I'm a gentleman.
Lies, Gullia.
My servants are here too.
They are Gullia.
I am Gullia.
I am Gullia.
I am Gullia.
I am Gullia.
I am Gullia.
I am Gullia.
They are Gullia.
But they lived their lives like people.
Let them stay like that until the end.
We captured Tsukiyama Miruma.
I repeat.
We captured Tsukiyama Miruma.
Great. Let's go home.
The mission is over.
Are you serious?
Let's enjoy the hunt.
It's not for nothing that they came up with something.
Attractive maneuver.
Who did he decide to become a bait for?
Wife.
Child.
The shelter can be hidden here.
And he knows that we won't touch them.
Give me the list of Tsukiyama Group's properties.
Yes, sir.
You disgusting insect.
Good morning, Mr. Shun.
Matsumae?
Where are we?
Where are we going?
A short trip.
Look me in the eye and answer.
Dad.
Where is he?
Mr. Miruma is still in the mansion.
Together with the rest of the staff.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Together with the rest of the staff.
Today at 7 p.m. Tsukiyama Group lost all its influence.
Wait.
Does that mean...
It means that Tsukiyama's family is over.
Mr. Miruma decided to distract the CCG so that we could escape.
Does that mean...
Does that mean we escaped?
It's just like...
Matsumae!
Matsumae!
Come back!
No.
I have to save my father!
No.
Matsumae!
No.
Because of our weakness, Tsukiyama's family's story is coming to an end.
But as long as you're alive, Mr. Shun,
this story can still change.
I...
I take responsibility for their lives?
That's what it means to be the head of the family.
So that's how it all turned out.
We couldn't stop them.
Okay.
We don't have time.
I'm going to help you.
Everyone here is from Tsukiyama Group.
We found out that you were in trouble and arrived immediately.
And until the helicopter comes after you,
we will protect you, Mr. Shun, at any cost.
There are so many of them.
My father is a great man.
Yes.
This is the family he created.
Wow!
I've seen him with all the boys.
He grew up a handsome young man.
That's right.
He's a nice young man.
I'd like him to be my model.
I think he'd be successful.
The face of all the ghouls.
That would be great.
It's for the sake of Mr. Miruma.
Today we'll pay him back.
Yes.
We'll give our lives for the sake of it.
We have a very good boss.
Now is not the time for sentiments.
Start destruction.
Kanoe.
To become expensive to someone,
first you need to take from him what is expensive.
I'll give you one of my bones.
Don't worry.
I'm sure he'll love you.
Look.
You're so cute.
