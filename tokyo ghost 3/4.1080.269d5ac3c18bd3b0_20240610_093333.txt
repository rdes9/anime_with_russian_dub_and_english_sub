Where am I?
I remember how I got into the car with Detective Suzui.
Hello, hello.
Is this Muzuki?
Answer me.
It's useless.
Take it.
Auction.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you for waiting.
So...
Our auction is open.
To the presenters and auctioneers.
Today we are going to...
Our auction is open.
To the presenters and auctioneers.
Today we are going to be the clowns.
Ladies and gentlemen, please enjoy the show.
Well...
And the first lot today...
The popular actor in the past, Okurayoshiki.
No!
Please!
The auction starts with 10 million.
10 million.
11 million.
Why is this actor so good?
It's easy to hit the price on celebrities.
And still...
What a bad taste.
20 million.
24 million.
25 million.
30 million.
30.
At the moment, the biggest bets are for number 33 and number 1.
31 million.
32 million.
32.5!
35 million.
Sold to the gentleman at number 33.
Who is he?
His name is Monsignor Krok.
He is not part of the Big Madam group.
But he is extremely rich.
I didn't even know that people were sold at such a price.
Everyone has their own idea of value.
I think they sell them as things.
Because they are empty inside.
If I had money...
Dora?
The auction starts with 1 million.
That's what I was going to say.
But she has a very unusual smell.
Is this a joke?
What?
One-Eyed Gull.
Here it is!
The one that will help Mr. Shook to return to life.
One-Eyed...
What about me?
Tell me, how can I take part?
Thor!
Thor will be sold now!
What are you talking about?
Thor!
What a rare copy!
Does it mean that the starting price will now be 10 million?
12!
15!
17!
What?
Someone...
Tell me what to do!
What can I do?
What about the operation?
Do I have to fight on my own?
I can't do it!
I can't do it!
I can't do it!
Then I'll...
Sensei!
The operation failed.
No one will come.
Stop.
I can't let that rare creature take over.
120 million.
She doesn't want to give up.
140 million.
However, number 110 is not lagging behind.
150!
180!
200 million!
Sold number one, madam!
Mister...
Shu!
You can take your purchases later, at the exit.
200 million! 200 million!
A kiss for 200 million!
200 million! 200!
Well, let's move on to the next lot,
while the tension has not yet gone down.
I'm sure it will also go down at a high price,
because here we have a beautiful young lady.
A pale skin and huge eyes,
like a real doll!
Madam, look, this girl could...
Madam...
So, let's get started!
The trade is canceled.
It's Susie! The pigeons have penetrated here!
The pigeons have penetrated here!
Madam, let's go!
My dear baby, Susie!
Pigeons!
Pigeons!
Pigeons!
Pigeons!
Pigeons!
Pigeons!
Pigeons!
Pigeons!
Pigeons!
Pigeons!
Start the storm.
To all units,
the main task is to destroy all the gullies inside.
Task number one is to eliminate Big Madam.
It is expected to interfere with the tree at the guillie,
but we will not miss such a chance.
Task number two is to save civilians.
People kidnapped for auctions are the priority.
If I didn't say that, the problem would not have been solved.
Saving civilians is the priority,
but our main goal is Big Madam.
Are these enemies? Are these enemies?
Gagi, Gugi.
Gagi.
Gugi.
There are quite a few of them. Let's unite our...
Oh, come on, old lady!
At such moments,
the first attacker laughs at the last one.
Brother, you're looking at me!
Oh, you fool!
A gullie in a white suit is on the front line.
This is Naki and Zaugiri.
Please come!
Tatashima and Isai, follow me.
We'll deal with the white suit.
Yes!
Kinami, what's outside?
It seems that the enemies have run away from the front and on the sides.
So we're surrounded.
Tell Naki and Mezi to break through the hole in the clutch.
I'll go protect Big Madam.
Got it.
What about me? What should I do?
Naki, come with me.
My dear little Juzo.
You're one-eyed.
I could take advantage of the panic.
Matsumaya,
go first.
I still have things to do.
I'll catch up with you.
The Quinks' squad has arrived at the entrance.
This is Gull and Augiri.
I'm going into battle.
Is this Sasaki Heisei?
He's moving like a detective.
The enemies at the entrance are destroyed.
Let's start!
What kind of bald freak is this?
Kokako, healthy.
Detective Sasaki, go ahead.
But...
We'll deal with him.
Detective Ata?
Go ahead, guys.
Got it.
Kokako, cover us.
Just don't touch us.
Got it.
Two hundred million! Two hundred!
Toru!
The main entrance is blocked.
Let's go to the spare room.
What's going on?
It hurts!
It hurts!
It hurts!
It hurts!
It hurts!
Two hundred million!
Looks like I can't handle a rabbit without Jason.
The operation failed.
No one will come.
Why did he lie?
Me?
How did he know about the operation?
Servus!
What are you up to?
Cat's head!
What's going on?
What's going on?
What's going on?
What's going on?
Cat's head!
This Naki is strong.
How many did he kill?
I don't even know.
Attack!
Numa!
It's...
S-rank!
Triple blade!
Thank you for your help, Misa.
Call me by my name, you idiot!
We can't handle this.
At this pace?
What?
I'm sure I've seen your face before.
But I don't remember your name.
Step back.
I'll deal with him.
Don't go too far, Detective Shibashi!
The time of the old men has long passed, Detective Shibashi.
That is, the killer of the subordinates.
The future of the new generation.
The new generation.
Just take it.
Help...
Help...
Everyone!
Yummy!
Misa!
I told you, you idiot!
You can't escape!
Hello, Kiraku.
The pigeons have reached the hall.
I can't get in touch with them.
Big Madam is in the basement.
Naki is being attacked by the spine.
Spine?
Mrs. Yotsume.
Are you unwell?
I'm fine.
All members of Aogiri, step back to the roof.
After that, we will help Naki and Misa.
The rabbit won't need any backup.
He will continue the security mission.
Where did Saiki go?
It's Blitz!
Mr. Shu!
I found you!
Welcome back, Gruarayh!
No!
I'm so happy!
Toru!
It's me, Toru!
You can't escape!
Don't you dare touch my Toru!
You bastard!
How dare you hit me!
Scheisse!
If she runs away,
I'll find you and kill you!
Stay here!
Toru!
It's me, Toru!
What an unexpected twist.
Do you think we should use the owl?
Maybe the owl is...
Maybe.
Are you ready, Tokizawa?
I want to eat.
I'm sorry, Detective Ato!
Who?
It's okay, cover me.
If Saiki was ordered to move on,
it means that his squad
is much stronger than ours.
It's hard for me to accept that.
However, their potential is impressive.
New technologies and new faces
are already pushing us old people.
Mr. Maruda, are you crazy?
He's still a child!
We'll find out soon.
Even the most convinced atheists
have moments of contact with God.
This is what happens
when you face an invincible force.
I...
saw God.
I saw His justice.
But even a simple man
who has nothing to do with God or the devil
can stand out
because of his experience
and hard work.
What?
It looks like fresh pineapple.
Time to start the operation.
