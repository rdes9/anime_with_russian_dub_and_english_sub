It's time for the second episode of Fragments.
Participant.
I don't have time...
...to regenerate.
Haisa?
Haisa?
Sensei!
Haisa!
Well?
Haisa!
Haisa!
Haisa!
Haisa!
Haisa!
Haisa!
Haisa!
Well?
The order of the elder on the call.
He's like a different man right now.
You can't get through here, Mr. Snake.
Well, you've interested me much harder than those kids.
I think you'd better not know anything about me.
Almost like that time.
My turn.
I think I'm going to die.
I don't care.
Damn it.
What's wrong with you?
It's all the same.
Kaneki.
You...
Nishio?
Kaneki.
Kaneki.
Kaneki.
Kaneki.
Kaneki.
What?
Who is this Nishio?
What is it?
What am I saying?
Sorry.
We don't have time.
Don't follow the snake.
Our squad is going to take care of Haisa.
Haisa?
Kuramoto.
Takeomi.
Got it.
Got it.
Kuraiwa.
Akira.
Yes.
On position.
Get a little older.
Haisa.
So you didn't manage to capture Nitorse.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
So you didn't manage to capture Nitorse.
I'm sorry.
You didn't manage to capture Nitorse.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.
How is Sasaki?
He lost control in the battle with the snake.
But thanks to the senior investigator Hirako, we managed to calm him down.
So it turns out that he was provoked by the contact with the snake?
Good.
Senior Investigator Moto.
Take care of the Queenx and Sasaki.
Yes, sir.
The Queenx project was initiated by your boss from the very beginning.
And Sasaki Polugule.
But he was also chosen as the mentor.
But what did he come up with?
Investigator Mado.
Something must have happened.
You're too tense.
Investigator Kijima.
Did you hear?
You had problems with Investigator Sasaki.
Yes.
But we managed to take the situation under control.
Polugule of the first class Sasaki and Investigator with sewn Queenx.
These Queenx are a truly incredible combination, aren't they?
What a pity.
I'm in a hurry.
I need to meet our guest from Germany.
Please forgive me, Investigator Mado.
Let's go, Furuta.
Order.
Assess Sasaki Heisei as a human.
Order.
If he gets out of control and becomes dangerous, he will be regarded as Guli liquidated.
What cruel orders.
Even without hands or legs, the investigator should run away.
Was it worth beating me for that?
A good commander will not be exposed to danger.
You can't turn your back on the enemy.
If you ran into him directly, you would be dead.
As long as you're alive, there's another chance.
But everything will be in vain if you die.
Uriya.
I'm removing you from the position of the commander of the Queenx squad.
I don't think so.
The order of the commander of the Queenx squad.
You're just Guli.
Uriya!
Sasan risked his life to save us.
You're a piece of shit, Guli.
I'll kill you right here.
Try it.
Uriya.
You should apologize to Super Sensei.
Useless hypocrite.
Shirazu.
Let him go.
Say what you want, Uriya.
That's what I decided.
I'll choose a new commander of the squad.
They will be...
Shirazu Ginshe, a third-class investigator.
What? Me?
Wait, Sasan.
Someone with brains is better for this.
I think the best commander is the one who acts in the interests of the squad.
If you explain, I'll eat you.
You said yourself that I'm Guli.
Hey, Uriya.
All my glasses.
Shirazu Ginshe?
Yes.
You can't tell by the look, but Shirazu always thinks about his comrades.
Uriya is certainly superior, but...
Pretty interesting move, Heisei.
In your style.
I hope that Uriya will take the lesson and work on his character.
Like a father?
You?
Good.
No.
They're just kids.
I give up.
Not bad, Heisei.
Arima.
You hear that voice again?
Yes.
He's whispering in my ear all the time.
I'm sure he's the former me.
I don't remember anything about my 20 years of life.
But...
Even if I don't have anything,
I'm pretty happy.
After all, if the past me comes back,
everything I've achieved in two years is going to disappear.
It scares me.
Don't you want to see your family or old friends?
I already have a family.
I'll take a look at your mansion.
I'll take a couple of books from you.
Don't worry.
I'll bring them myself.
Everything's fine.
I want to see my grandchildren.
Even if I lose control,
I can come back.
Arima will definitely notice.
You're incorrigible.
I...
I'm sorry for being rude.
I only came because Thor asked me to.
Even if...
It's a lie.
I'm calling the CCG headquarters.
During the inspection of Thor's mansion,
the Shimaguchi detachment
was attacked by a ghoul from the Augean tree.
We're out of order.
I repeat,
a ghoul from the Augean tree.
A ghoul!
Uri!
Kura-Iwa.
How's Detective Sasaki?
Our mentor.
He's not sugar-coated.
That's good.
That's not good.
Nothing good, Kura-Iwa.
Your father...
He left me to die.
I won't forgive him.
Why didn't he fight with him?
Do you know what it's like
to bury your father's body?
Do you know?
Do you know, Kura-Iwa Takeobi?
Let me know when I can visit him.
See you.
Yes.
Look, don't overdo it.
Make a living.
Senior Detective Shimaguchi.
I'm sorry about your detachment.
I'm sorry.
But you couldn't tell me what happened.
You want me to strengthen your Kagune?
Yes.
You want to be like Detective Sasaki?
Let me explain again
how your bodies work.
The idea of creating the Queen's detachment
appeared thanks to Detective Sasaki.
Just like a ghoul was implanted in your body,
and covered with five protective frames.
At the moment, the level is set to the second frame.
Your Kakuha is used by 40%.
So, if I increase the level of the frame,
my Kagune will become stronger, right?
I don't recommend doing that.
You're late.
Please, Dr. Shiba.
I need permission from the commander and the mentor first.
Don't be a moralist,
old man.
So, it's a rabbit, right?
Yes.
Together with Fuyaguchi,
this ghoul killed my father.
Detective Mada Kureo.
Arima said that he was a detective
and that he was a ghoul.
That's right.
He was a ghoul.
He was a ghoul.
Mada Kureo.
Arima said that he was a detective from God.
And that he learned how to control the Queen.
Considering that the cake is tied to Aogiri,
this case will be taken away from us.
It will be handed over to the detachment
from S1 to S3.
Interesting.
Is everything all right with Shibaguchi?
In the end, only he survived.
It's hard
to lose those you spent so much time with.
Having joined Aogiri,
you won't be able to escape.
Think before you decide.
I really have nowhere else to go.
But Aogiri...
How did I get to this?
Just a minute.
If I use Aogiri,
maybe...
Hey, Saiki.
Yeah, what?
Ayato.
Ayato?
Among those queens,
there was no one by the name of Sasaki.
Sasaki Heise.
Here it is.
What do we do now?
What are you talking about?
The queens will no longer deal with the cake.
They said that it could be somehow connected
with the old Aogiri.
You won't write anything.
Aogiri's case is in the detachment from S1 to S3.
But we've come so far.
And this is the case of Aogiri.
And this is the case of Aogiri.
We've come so far.
And this is the case of Aogiri.
There is no choice.
You know how many victims there were
in the collision with the tree two years ago.
You know?
Well, yeah.
Hey, Saiki.
Are you serious?
Have you decided to eat ham in one go?
Delicious and juicy!
So, what's the new goal?
Some kind of click there.
Hurry up.
Take me.
Really?
Is this for real?
Right, you're right.
Hey, Sasan.
Where's the clicker
that you were supposed to do the 30th time?
I just wanted to change my image.
Clicker.
Operation in the area of red lanterns.
It doesn't have a rank.
Why exactly the clicker?
Because it literally loves
to click man's nuts.
It even sounds painful.
By the way, Captain Shirazu.
Where are Surya and Saiki now?
Prince Surya said it doesn't matter
how he feels.
Go to the doctor.
Something happened with his frame
or something like that.
So he's been in the hospital for a couple of days.
We should have reported this first.
I'm sorry.
And Saiki?
We tried to wake her up,
but she didn't answer.
She locked herself in her room.
I hope she won't get poisoned
by the meat relapse.
Meat?
That's right.
I have a good feeling about this.
Sensei?
Oh, no.
Let's go have some coffee.
Let's go have some coffee.
Oh!
What an aroma!
Coffee is definitely served
in the highest grade here.
That's what my nose says, Kagune.
You seem to know a lot about this subject, Sasan.
He once said that his hobby
is to walk around coffee shops.
Oh!
Hey, brother.
How many times do I have to tell you
to say hello to your client?
I look back, feeding me
Before I realize you're really gone
My dreams will be beside me
That we wouldn't meet again
Your eyes kiss and your tears are falling
I know you have
Not forgotten the past time
We shared as I cried
Give me what you like
Your tears are falling
Outside value
I know this meeting will not last
I have to let go
I smiled
I was anxious
And a little sad
I...
At that moment I thought
How could it be
So beautiful
