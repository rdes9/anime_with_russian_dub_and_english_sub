Sasaki Haisa, investigator.
Nice to meet you, Mutsuki.
Good morning.
Are you going to have breakfast?
Yes.
Interesting.
I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you, Sensei.
I love you, Sensei!
I'm so ashamed.
Womenly.
Why...
Why didn't you come to save me, Sensei?
Why?
Episode 18. Shining. Face.
What do you think about the One-Eyed King?
I think he's strong.
Are you going to stop him?
But Haisa is my friend. He always carried sweets for me.
And on my birthday, he even made pudding.
But...
I know how to set priorities.
How is Mochi?
Ori.
Do you really think that it's Mamano who killed Ari Makish?
Sentiments are nothing.
Wow!
Well, it's time for the clones.
In his will, the head of Vashu Tsuniyoshi,
on the position of president,
promoted Furutu Souto, a member of the Vashu clan.
But...
Obviously, the headquarters will be the next target.
Oh!
If that's the case, we should concentrate on defense.
Oh, maybe they want us to think that way.
Then what do you suggest?
CCG has already encountered a similar problem with the clones.
I'm sure that investigators Kuroiwa and Tanakamaru know what to do.
I don't think so.
The department will continue to defend itself,
and the head of the headquarters will be the perfect investigator.
So, Ari Makish...
Ari Makish is dead.
That's right.
So, someone will have to become Ari Makish.
And I have a suitable candidate.
Investigator Suzuyo.
Yes.
It will be done.
I'm listening to your instructions.
For a moment, Furutu became the outflow of the Ishitoki.
Mr. Souto!
Yes, sir?
Yes, sir.
What's the matter?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Mr. Ui!
Takki didn't tell you anything?
No.
How come?
Ito, stop perceiving it as personal.
Otherwise, you will lose something important.
Something important?
And what will it be?
The mentor you respected?
The senior who was supposed to understand you?
Or the comrade you brought up?
I've already lost all of this.
The ninth district.
Fried squid.
Okonomiyaki.
Hiroshima.
We are from CCG.
Clear the way.
On call for the ninth district.
The enemy uses an explosive!
Fire Miner.
The eighteenth district.
The eighteenth district.
Fire Miner.
Fire Miner.
Fire Miner.
Fire Miner.
District 17 is cleared!
Second district.
Hissaa! Look at that sexy costume!
Are you serious?
Security headquarters?
Furu was right.
Suzie, protect the headquarters.
Good luck.
Unit S-1.
Divide into groups and help the district.
Yes!
How are things?
Ito, District 9!
The residents are in panic!
The whole district is in a panic!
The whole district is in a panic!
District 18, Takanamaru.
It's hard to get the control back.
We're going back to the headquarters, guys.
Second district, Uriya.
They fixed the fire, so we're a little behind.
District 19, Uriya.
We're ready to start the attack.
What's that?
The enemy was spotted on the bridge.
Why are there so many of them?
Detective Suzie.
If they cross the bridge, they'll end up right in the headquarters.
Protect him at all costs.
At all costs?
I just need to kill them all.
Yeah, right.
Kill them all.
Kill them all.
Kill them all.
Kill them all.
I'm Vancouver.
At a time like this, they just have to be the commander.
Go on.
Yes!
Let's go.
Meow.
Priest, SS-rank.
Looks like the kittens went the wrong way.
Donata-barbara!
Don't weaken the defenses.
Or you'll die, Uriya Cookie.
You're not an ordinary kitten.
There won't be many ordinary cat toys.
One day he got lost and went to jail.
I'll bring him back to the Gokuril.
Doesn't it look great, Uriya Cookie?
They're pressing the numbers, but they're incredibly weak.
Something's not right.
They've already figured it out.
Suzie, what are you doing here?
I'm here to protect you.
I'm here to protect you.
I'm here to protect you.
I'm here to protect you.
You've figured it out?
Suzie, you've noticed too?
Yes.
You...
are human.
Bezlykiy, SS-rank.
Hello, you runaway puppet.
Let's play.
Sure.
Let me draw your face.
Are you going to fight back?
Why are you doing this?
Juzo!
Mr. Shinohara?
Come on.
Don't push yourself so hard.
Mr. Shinohara?
It was just an illusion.
Suzie, my Cosmos.
Don't let anyone touch it.
Never.
I'm sorry.
I'm frozen.
In a rush of nostalgia.
Punish me.
There are people in the ranks of clowns.
Don't kill clowns who don't deserve to die.
I'm afraid of forcing people to fight.
And make the enemy feel guilty.
This plan was invented by a real bastard.
So I guess it's time to greet them.
The name of the nasty investigator.
I'm sorry, Mr. Shinohara.
The name of the nasty investigator who caught me.
Uri Mikito.
That was your father.
Dad!
When I grow up, I want to be an investigator like you.
I'd rather work with you, Kouki.
Dad...
If only my father could catch him.
Oh, so you're still alive.
That was a good game, though.
Poor kid.
All your bad luck comes from your father.
That's a lie!
I make my own decisions.
I decided to become an investigator.
You wanted him to recognize you?
You wanted him to praise you and pat you on the head?
It doesn't matter what you achieve.
That's always not enough.
Shut up!
The only one you hate is your father.
You hate the poor guy who left you all alone.
You're wrong!
You're wrong!
You're wrong!
You're wrong!
You're wrong!
You don't have to be so upset.
Looks like I've lost my finger.
Anybody?
No.
Help!
Uri!
Uri!
You're out of the frame!
Hey, Uri!
What if we get hit from the roof?
We're gonna be seen as a hooligan and destroyed.
Really?
I don't want my friends to kill me.
That's for sure.
Then we need the frames.
If the situation is not critical,
there's no need to worry.
But for you to know,
if this happens to any of you,
my hand won't shake.
We have inhuman power
and our duty is to die without making noise.
Hey, Uri!
I don't want
anyone else to die.
I'm coming, Prince Uri!
What?
How do you like that?
How dare you stab me with a sword?
You're such a fool!
Take this!
Take this!
You're in jail, Saika.
You can't get away with this,
you hooligan!
That's because you're too much of a hooligan!
They say, a sword is a sword.
You're not a hooligan!
You're a hooligan!
Wake up, Uriya Koki!
You're the commander!
Damn it!
You pushed it all on me!
Sasaki!
Damn Sasaki!
Stop playing around with other people!
I'm strong!
I'm strong!
I'm strong!
Look at me!
Look at me!
Look!
No!
Shut up!
You're a hooligan!
I'm watching you.
I'm watching you, damn it!
I love you, Uriya!
You're strong, Uriya.
You've become so strong.
Your mistake is that you kept everything to yourself,
just like your mom.
I love you, Uriya.
I love you, Uriya.
I love you, Uriya.
I love you, Uriya.
I love you, Uriya.
I love you, Uriya.
I love you, Uriya.
Just like your mom.
It can't be...
It can't be...
Uriya...
They are...
...people?
The defeat of...
...CCJ...
We lost a lot of people during the clone siege.
That's why the director reworked the management structure.
Listen carefully.
Good morning.
Furuta, what are you doing?
It's a party today.
Hello, director says.
Today I will show you the new power of CCJ.
Motsuke?
They are called A-Guy.
A new squad of Queens.
Queens?
Bring them...
...to the world of death.
Bring the world together with their death.
Wow!
These nasty clones used people as a shield.
It's unforgivable.
Today CCJ will focus on destroying the clones.
Our goal is to clear Tokyo.
To destroy...
...every ghoul.
Give me your strength.
And let the party begin.
