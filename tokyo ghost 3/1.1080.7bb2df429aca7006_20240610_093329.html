        <pre>They mix with the crowd. They feed on humanity.
Externally, they're indistinguishable from people.
But in reality, they don't look alike at all.
People call them...
...the Ghouls.
Rebirth!
They're not the same.
They're the same.
They're the same.
They're the same.
They're the same.
They're the same.
They're the same.
They're the same.
They're the same.
They're the same.
They're the same.
They're the same.
To be continued...
To be continued...
Stop!
You want to get out of here?
I'm a Goulian investigator.
What? You thought nobody would notice?
It smells like blood.
How is it?
Is that your blade?
Rank A.
Rank A. Or B.
Rank A. Or B.
I'm a Goulian investigator.
Rank A. Or B.
You're unarmed,
You're unarmed, human.
You're unarmed, human.
I'll eat you.
I'll eat you.
I'll eat you.
Little Shurik.
Little Shurik.
Shirazu Ginsha, third-class investigator.
Shirazu Ginsha, third-class investigator.
Yes, Shirazu.
You've set me up with your attacks.
What's wrong with your Queen?
You'll have to repair it.
Ay-ay-ay, sir.
Team commander.
Yes, Shirazu.
Rest in peace.
Hey.
What are you?
Goulians?
This is the Queen zone.
We use your tricks.
Write it down on your account.
Are you kidding?
I finished it.
This is called team work.
You just followed me and attacked my target.
You didn't even scratch it.
I did all the work.
How could you...
Don't relax.
Episode one.
Hunters.
It looks like the Goul
that Uriya and his friend
from the Mada detachment
were looking after wasn't Thorso.
In any case, I'm in charge of Thorso.
I'll be grateful
if the Mada detachment takes care of other things.
By the way,
I've heard that
in the recent case of a strange roar
people suspected Goul,
but it turned out to be a stray dog.
Yeah,
we were a little unlucky.
It's not funny at all, Sasaki.
These whores
that you took under your wing
are the only thing they do
to spend our budget.
The idea itself
is to bring these half-humans,
half-Gouls together for an investigation.
Yesterday you couldn't even
finish that taxi driver Goul.
Why did you decide
to leave this demand alive?
Well...
Do you feel sorry for Goul?
Although it's okay for you.
You were Goul yourself.
Detective Shimaguchi.
It's my job to report the subordinates.
He'll explain everything to me later.
Detective Mada,
maybe your work is not effective?
I repeat,
I'm in charge of the Torso case.
Seeing that the investigation is going on
at the speed of a snail,
I couldn't resist sending help.
Enough of your...
Detective Mada,
Detective Shimaguchi,
stop it.
As for the Torso case,
Shimaguchi and Mada detachment
take care of them together.
We, the Hirako detachment,
will continue to track the snake.
That's all for today.
Get rid of your softness in battle.
Your kindness will eventually destroy you.
Get a grip,
you're a mentor.
Your mistakes will be reflected
on all Kuynks.
Stop defending Gouls,
or you'll slap another Mada blow.
Slap another Mada.
In short,
find the Torso earlier, Shimaguchi.
Or the snake.
Arima and I are counting on you.
Even Arima?
The Kuynks project.
The creation of people
who are stronger than even Arima Kisho.
Bastard!
What?
That's what I'm called now.
Why are Gouls hunting us down?
Why do I have to
stand in front of those who are about to die?
Hey,
have you heard anything about Gouls
called Torso?
I've heard it for the first time.
I see.
If so, goodbye.
Commander,
do you hear me?
Sasan told us
to work in the team, remember?
I don't want to obey
Sasaki.
I'm going to transfer to S3.
What is S3?
None of your business.
Just make sure
you don't get confused.
You're not going to give me orders.
Let's figure it out
right here.
I'm the team commander.
I have orders.
I don't object.
You two are looking for Gouls
named Torso, aren't you?
Do you need any information?
You still can't handle it,
Mutsuki?
I can't do anything about it.
I can't stand the sight of blood.
Kagura,
you haven't shown up yet?
No,
not yet.
By the way, what do you think, Jack Winksock?
Well, they're the same,
aren't they?
No one else
but you and Uriya
has come to inspect.
I'll give it to them.
Thank you.
As if someone
is going to listen to me.
Uri,
you're 24?
I sell photos
with information
attached to them.
So,
where does Torso get his victim?
Well,
it's not free.
Name your price.
A million.
Or
Sasaki Heisei's personal thing.
She said
the information will be delivered after the payment.
Let's tell Sasan
and take his body.
What's wrong?
Shirazu,
you need money, don't you?
What does it have to do with it?
Sasaki,
our mentor.
If we pass our evidence
and find Torso as a team,
it will be regarded as a merit of the detachment.
That's normal.
You don't understand.
By making corrections in the report,
Sasaki can
make a merit for himself.
What do you mean?
You're right.
You need money,
so you need
an increase.
And for that, you need Slava.
But what should we do?
Work alone.
Not the whole detachment will get Slava,
but us.
It's the fastest way to get up.
Got it.
So it will be.
Sasan, no, Sasaki.
He won't get up on my way anymore.
Well done.
Trustful idiot.
Where's Uria?
She's hunting Torso.
She's ignoring orders again.
What about Sayaka?
She's probably playing in her room.
Sayaka!
Dinner!
Coming!
Bon appetit.
Let's eat.
Delicious.
I'm glad.
Oh, hi.
Dinner's ready.
I'm not hungry.
Uria,
how's the investigation going?
Don't worry.
I'll catch Torso myself.
Please pay
these bills.
They don't want to work together.
All right.
I guess I'll have to show them
what a serious Sasaki means.
Sensei?
Let's go, Nutsuke.
We'll catch Torso,
we'll put Uria and Shirazu behind bars.
Got it.
I'll show these newcomers.
And Shimoguchi too.
You'll see what Sasaki Heisei is made of.
Kakuria, district 23.
Guli's detention center.
Donato Parpara.
He's known as a priest.
SS rank.
They say he devoured the orphans
he promised to protect.
Is he your newcomer?
Heisei.
He looks hungry.
Uria,
how's the investigation going?
Donato Parpara, district 23.
Guli's detention center.
He's known as a priest.
SS rank.
Why are you here?
What do you want today?
I want to know about Guli,
named Torso.
He has a lot of hunting skills.
He only sacrifices women.
He took Torso from everyone.
I see.
Torso mania?
Since it's so far away,
our friend uses a car.
Yeah.
If all the places are so far away from each other,
maybe he's afraid he'll be found.
Guli is hiding his presence.
He's trying to adapt to the world around him.
Remember every little thing.
He's a taxi driver.
Uria has been suspecting this for a long time.
I have a message from Torso.
A message?
That's enough.
The pigeons are following you.
Have you heard about the Kuings?
No.
They say they're people
who have the skills of a megalodon.
Be careful.
Kuings...
They're just like you, brother.
Trusila Sassana.
Sniff, sniff.
Don't worry.
We brought you clean ones.
Okay, your photos.
What's this?
A photo from the crime scene.
It's supposed to be a victim.
I think Torso did it himself.
By the way,
it was taken on a very expensive
foreign film.
And this client ordered
a whole bunch of such films.
Saiki Karao.
It's working.
Scars from appendicitis.
Scars from Kesarev.
After the surgery,
the victim has one common trait.
Everyone has scars.
But how does he know about it
before the attack?
Look.
Torso's victims are
in a small radius
from the city hospitals.
Let's split up
and check them.
If you see
someone suspicious,
don't do anything.
Let everything go its own way.
Excuse me.
I'll sit down.
There's a lot of taxis in this city.
Yeah.
Shut up and look for them, idiot.
Mutsuki, I got in touch with Torso.
Mutsuki already found Torso?
So, what do we do?
Turn around.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Please,
repeat your address.
How?
Faster!
You want to get your payback?
I don't care!
My lady!
My head!
You're beautiful!
I think I'm in love!
Number sign!
It's him! Torso!
Damn it!
What the hell?
I need to forget my mask.
Shina, use your kagune!
What?
Don't complain if I miss.
Masilo!
I warned you!
Scooter and taxi!
Go to the side!
They're following Gula.
Let's help them.
Taxi driver!
Go to the side!
Bastard!
Lockada?
It's Sasaki.
Now you're an easy target!
Is that Quince?
They're like Gula.
I don't know who they are, but they're definitely not humans.
I have to fight.
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Kagune!
Come out!
It's okay.
They fight so well, Kagune.
And I...
He heals too fast.
I keep attacking.
I need to attack him together.
I'm afraid you won't make it.
So you two are Quince?
Show me your kagune.
Asshole!
Damn it!
This guy!
Are you serious?
You pigeons are doing dirty things.
You're better than idiots and idiots.
You're better than idiots and idiots.
Since the day hasn't come, I'll have fun with you.
Sorry, pigeons.
I surrender.
What's that?
Are you shooting at the peas?
What? They're not scratched!
My kagune!
Hurry up, chicken.
Even Uriya couldn't handle this guy.
But I...
Can I handle him?
Hi. I didn't expect you to be here.
Well, then I'll start with you.
Bombing close!
Toro!
Run!
Shut up!
We need to retreat.
My kagune has found us.
We need to retreat for a while.
Retreat?
I'm sorry, Kukin.
Commander S3 ordered us to retreat.
Commander S3 ordered us to retreat.
And he fought alone.
I'm sorry.
We couldn't save your father.
Don't make me laugh!
Hey, idiot!
What are you doing?
I'm eating to quickly restore my kagune!
Increase, increase, increase, increase!
God...
Sasan!
Sensei!
Who are you?
Are you a rooster?
He's different.
Leave my students alone!
Leave my students alone!
Calm down for a second.
Damn!
Where did your horse go?
He hit me with a knife.
Maybe here?
Sasan!
Hurry up and leave!
Move!
You're strong.
You're weak, Heisei.
At this pace,
all your friends will be killed.
You can't protect anyone.
Turn around
and look at me.
Stop pretending.
You know you need me.
But
accept me.
You need me.
Shut up!
I won't let you swallow me.
Mutsuki!
Call Akira!
Akira...
Arima...
Give me strength!

I'm dead.
I'm not very rich, but I'm quite rich and so happy.
