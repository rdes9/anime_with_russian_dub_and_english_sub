        <pre>How's the Rusim cleaning going?
57 percent.
Don't tell anyone about the kukuri on the island.
Yes, sir.
For example, when I wake up,
everything is an illusion.
I want you to make a miracle dream come true.

Owl. SS Rank.
Doesn't look like me.
Kachikawa.
Hit.
You're out of turn.
Brother, come on.
You don't like your spring.
Is that why your hairstyle looks like a broom?
Look at me.
You don't like your spring.
Is that why your face looks like a prison?
Hachi.
Doesn't look like me.
Do you want to eat kachikawa?
Yes.
And you, Saeki?
What?
Looks like it's all right.
No, it's not enough.
You need to stand out to get into a special class.
Kachikawa is not in touch.
They came across the SS Rank, it looks like an owl.
Leader! Mutsuki!
Right now.
Killing Aogiri is a priority.
Go.
Please.
Wait, Mutsuki.
Toru.
Sister.
It's all right.
Suzuya.
It's a monster.
Triple blade, SS Rank.
On the rights of a member of the Suzuya squad, I will destroy you.
Suzuya's subordinate?
I can't pull it out.
I'll give you a silver skull.
You're strong, triple blade.
I'm almost dead.
You say you're from the Suzuya squad?
We lost about a hundred people when we captured his older brother.
And I won't be surprised if it turns out that he is no less dangerous.
Akira.
Keep in mind that now any of us can die.
Tatara, SS Rank.
I'm just defending myself.
I can't win at such a pace.
Great reflexes.
Well-trained.
But we...
...are not bad at squeaking either.
Let's play.
It's better to run away.
She's much stronger than me in every way.
And she uses her endurance with her mind.
I can't compare to her.
It hurts!
I don't understand.
Why are you following Suzuya?
It hurts.
This man doesn't care about the lives of others.
Maybe he abandoned you too?
Allow me to correct three of your mistakes.
First, the investigator naturally obeys his leader.
Secondly, I, Abor, am 100% loyal to Suzuya.
And thirdly, Suzuya never abandons his subordinates.
I'm glad to see you, Rei.
You look like a real monster, Kurone.
Well, let's say hello.
Hoji, I'm very glad.
After all, everything will end today.
My sorrow for my brother, my hatred for you...
...and the tree of Aoba.
Yes, everything will end.
You will die here.
That's right.
I still hate you.
How, Hoji?
You look just like your brother.
Your friends?
That's great.
Finally, I can show Shiro your suffering.
Shiro?
She could survive that wound?
What?
She's right here, right now!
Don't you dare ignore her!
Oh, that's disgusting.
Shiro is still alive.
Dad will definitely cure her.
I doubt it.
Shut up!
Suzuya!
Go!
So your flame feeds the desire of the mystic?
Everything is over.
Hello.
I'll chop you into small pieces.
Oh, my God.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
It's time to use something more effective.
I killed them.
I killed them.
I killed Rei.
I killed Suzuya and Juzo!
Did he die?
Erno!
Please, don't hate me.
Oh, you're back.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
I'm fighting someone for the second time.
I can't lose.
Tatara, hi.
This is for the last time.
Take this!
Get off me!
Hot! Hot! Hot!
But...
But...
But it's nice.
You know, it was damn painful the last time.
Exactly.
Something like that.
What's going on?
Well, let's have some fun.
Hoji, I...
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I...
Everybody, get ready to attack Gullia SS Rangasavu.
Why? Why? Why?
Why?
Why?
I...
Because there...
I...
It's just a feeling.
Detective Takizawa.
Who are you?
Who are you?
Why me?
Well, first of all...
Look at your body.
After the fight for the 20th district, I got the bodies of 63 investigators.
Only you were successful.
Successful?
I think you know what kind of creatures can grow limbs.
Takizawa, from today on, you are Gullia.
Oh, the body began to tear off the remnants of food in the stomach.
Perfect.
Don't!
I'm begging you!
Enough!
I just want to know how to create the perfect Kaneki Ken.
No, please don't!
Please!
Tatara died from my hand.
TCG, I saved you.
I really wanted to save you.
But you don't care.
I was your subordinate.
I...
I wanted you to notice me.
You're so rude, Amon.
I'm sorry.
Hi.
Welcome back, Kuro.
I'm home.
Dad.
You've grown up.
What do you want?
Shiro.
Save her.
Save the dead?
Shiro is still alive.
She's breathing and even eating.
And her voice.
Voice?
That's for sure.
These are gases.
Gases?
Yes, gases.
Gases that come out of your body through a hole.
What are you going to do?
Shiro is already dead.
If that's the case, I'll just kill you.
Okay.
My Queens and my past creation.
Let's see who's better.
I decided to show up only when Mada was in danger.
You know, I just killed Hoji.
You're exactly the same as everyone else.
Are you going to kill me, Amon?
I...
came to save...
my former comrade.
Save?
You came all so strong.
But how are you going to do that?
You've always been running away.
If you decide to save me,
let's see what you're made of, Amon Kotaro.
Amon...
Guli, this is how I do it.
You're too weak.
Kanagawa,
you're too weak.
Kanagawa said you were useless and obviously right.
Are you going to keep lying to yourself?
Huh?
I know.
All your weak and strong sides.
You're not Guli.
You're the investigator of Guli, Takizawa.
Shut up!
What do you want from me?
Investigator Mada.
Quinten's squad.
Orwa,
what are you doing here?
I'm going to kill you.
I'm going to kill you.
I'm going to kill you.
I'm going to kill you.
I'm going to kill you.
Quinten's squad.
Orwa, take care of the owl.
Divide.
Mada!
Where are you, Mutsuki?
It's hot! It's hot!
So?
Next.
Next.
Naki,
why are you...
Wait.
Naki!
Triple blade.
The outcome of the battle is predetermined. You will die.
You'd better kill yourself.
Get out of the pot.
Until I let go of my last breath.
And I will fight!
You...
Are you alive?
I just warmed up.
Brother!
It's so easy not to break your nose.
I'm the chief of the White Horses.
I'm the chief of the White Horses.
I'm the chief of the White Horses.
I'm the chief of the White Horses.
I'm the chief of the White Horses.
And if I die, only with honor.
Too much.
Don't be upset. You won't do anything.
Kana!
It's because of you, we...
You're a complete psycho!
You're a mad scientist!
I thought you'd call me that.
I agree.
They have no end.
They have no end.
It seems to have become more.
Allow me to help you, gentlemen.
And who else?
