        <pre>I invite the helicopter for an immediate attack. Let's arrange a spring cleaning.
Wroo!
Furuta, there's blood on the floor. Don't slip.
Yes.
Damn it! Mr. Miruma!
We have enemies ahead of us. Mutsuki, on your flank.
Yes.
Saika, move!
With such skills, the guys will live in any detachment. They all grew up like that.
Yes.
Good. Let's move on.
Yes.
Got it.
Mayla!
Mr. Shu, I'm glad you're safe.
Matsumaya, the lower floors were captured.
That woman is leading them.
Got it.
Mr. Shu, the helicopter will arrive soon. Wait for it on the roof.
Matsumaya, why didn't you put on your mask?
Promise me you'll come back.
Promise me.
Will you come back earlier today?
Yes.
Promise?
Of course.
I can't promise.
Matsumaya!
Mr. Shu, please survive.
From the very beginning, my life belonged to you.
Please don't let her die in vain.
Your words...
It's not fair, Matsumaya.
THE END
THE END
THE END
Sasaki, I'm worried about what's going on on the roof.
Go there and look for everything.
Got it.
Commander Shirazu, don't let them down.
Got it.
Oh, shit.
A ninja from CCG.
There's no one here.
Even such a big company.
Even she could disappear so quickly.
Mr. Shu, I beg you, please, hold on.
You have enough strength to go through these thorns.
I believe in you.
Mr. Shu, I know it's rude.
But I beg you anyway.
Forgive me for this.
After all, I loved you like a younger brother.
What?
What a ridiculous horse.
Episode 11. Fail.
Episode 11. Fail.
Detective Sasaki, the situation is on the roof.
Sasaki!
No one got here yet.
Do you pity me?
Please surrender.
Then I can persuade CCG to take you under security.
Surrender to me?
I'm not going to surrender.
My father, all the rest, they gave their lives for me to survive.
I don't belong to myself anymore.
Mr. Sasaki, I don't know you.
Stop!
Reinforcements?
We'll destroy him.
Don't weaken the defense.
I don't know what kind of beast you are.
Detective Shimaguchi!
Are you in your right mind?
Run!
No!
I told you to run!
Do you want to make up, stupid girls?
You know, I hate both of you.
You're both just a hindrance.
Useless trash.
Get out of here!
We liked working with you.
Where are you standing?
Detective Shimaguchi.
We'll win some time.
Go away!
The connection with Shimaguchi's squad is lost.
It looks like reinforcements have arrived.
The Quints' squad and the It's squad, help Shimaguchi.
Got it.
I have a bad feeling about this.
I thought it was strong.
I think it's time to end this.
At this pace...
What can I do?
I'm already...
Mr. Shu.
That's right.
There's one more weapon left.
My feelings...
have been exposed!
Wait.
Get ready.
He's coming!
Ume, come on!
He's coming!
He's coming!
Nazo!
You're not afraid of her?
How can you not be afraid of her?
Thank you.
Uri!
Shirazu!
Hold on tight!
Got it.
Saiko!
We did it.
We did it.
What?
Are you kidding me?
This is the first time I've seen such regeneration.
Mito...
Detective Mito!
My ribs!
Come on.
Seriously?
There's a hole in me.
Detective Lichie!
Okahiro!
Queen!
I told you to bring him here!
Hurry!
Got it!
Die!
Hurry!
Die!
Hurry!
We did it!
My shield!
Otsumaya!
Mayu!
I'm leaving Mr. Shun to you!
Uri!
I don't need legs!
Detective Lichie!
Oh, oh.
I didn't think Kairu would fall.
Goodbye, beauty.
I guess I'll let you feel these blades, too.
They cut your humor into pieces,
and Aliza's talk.
Don't you dare
underestimate
the life of the palace.
Mr. Kijima!
Go to hell!
Mr. Kijima!
It's shaking!
Cheese!
I want it back!
Let's go!
Yuma.
Aliza.
Mayu.
I avenged you.
Mr. Shun.
I'll be back soon.
Attack the front!
Furuta, stand back and wait!
Got it.
What?
Detective Furuta, what are you doing?
I'm sorry,
did he tell you to wait?
Did he use you as a shield?
You have no honor!
I'm sorry.
Come on.
It was you who killed him.
My eyes!
And you're so proud.
Well, in the end, don't look at me.
You're just a monster devouring people,
aren't you?
It's not that I'm worried.
You missed.
I'm sorry.
And how are you going to get out of here alone?
It's just a suicide!
Detective Pagulian,
it shouldn't concern you.
I'll get you out of here,
and I'll leave.
Exactly.
Then he goes to the left,
waiting for me to open up.
He turns Kagune.
Out!
I realized how he was moving.
Now,
a big swing.
Yes.
It brings back memories.
As expected.
You're strong.
Well, Sasaki Haisa,
kill me.
Don't die.
Shut up!
Kastretedborg!
Kana?
Is that you, Bukal?
Yes.
You'd better survive, Kuramoto!
Damn it!
No matter how much we attack him,
we need to do something about his regeneration.
If only we had a powerful queen.
I...
I'll use her!
Go!
And don't you dare to get up!
Or I'll kill you!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
And don't you dare to get up!
Please!
Do you know why roses are considered beautiful?
Because they bloom quickly.
Remain in honor of Master Sho's memories
and die!
Haisa, one more time.
I can't anymore.
Arima.
Get up, Haisa.
And do your job.
Kill, just like me.
You're my queen.
Or Haisa?
You want to die again?
I lost consciousness for a second.
What was that?
No.
It belongs to me.
It's my body.
Everything is mine. Mine!
You're not worthy of Master Sho.
Master Sho.
My pride.
My light.
Mine!
Emma.
Forget about the children.
Yes.
Nathaniel.
Arnold.
Karam.
Take it with honor.
Good name, Roosevelt.
Soon after leaving the house,
we lost our mother.
The older brothers gave up their lives
to protect me.
In the end, I was left alone.
When I arrived in the family of Tsukiyama,
I behaved like one of the brothers.
And I did what I could to fulfill
the wish of my father, the heir.
Tomorrow, another lesson.
Yes.
Kanaya.
It happened a lot.
How long are you going to hide?
Maybe everything is fine now,
but soon your body.
I know.
I can save them.
My feelings for the family.
If I train the body.
All servants already know.
The only one who doesn't know,
Master Sho.
Master Sho.
Master Sho.
My heart is all closed
in a rose cage.
A table.
A lot of food.
A sea.
The most important thing is
solitude.
Pain.
Lack.
Pride.
Master Sho.
Death.
Ignorance.
Despair.
How to sleep in bed?
Flower.
Rose.
Time.
Cruelty.
Lies.
Lies.
Woman.
Woman.
Do you want to be loved?
Do I want to be loved?
Of course I do.
Kanae.
Master Sho.
Don't interfere.
It became unlikely for me.
Sad.
And forgotten lines came to mind.
My favorite mistake.
When you grew up.
Your parents were bad.
They brought you up.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Uriya, that's enough for you!
No one will punish you.
