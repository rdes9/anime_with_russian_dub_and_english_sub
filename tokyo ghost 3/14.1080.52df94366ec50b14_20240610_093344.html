Thanks, Ayato.
I'll take care of the rest.
You let them all out of the chamber.
Yes, sir.
Why is the roof open?
Who knows?
I'm sure that bastard is somewhere around here.
Banjo, I'm counting on you.
I'm sorry for taking so long.
Why?
I'm so happy.
But why did you come?
Although...
I'm so sad.
You're an investigator, aren't you?
Are you going to repeat everything again?
This is my last mission.
I'll save Hinami...
and die in Arima's hands.
To be continued...
To be continued...
To be continued...
To be continued...
Arima...
Kishou...
Kishou...
Why can't I get in?
But not here.
You...
Arima...

Episode 14
Volt
White Darkness
Renji!
Her name is Touka.
Sweetie, I'm going.
Touka?
Let's fly!
Mom, I want to, too.
Wait, Ayato.
One more time, one more time!
Okay, let's fly.
I...
didn't protect her.
Because she was weak.
Because I...
Stop making yourself a victim to ease the blame.
You...
You'd better die instead of her!
Episode 15
He...
is eating Gou!
Episode 16
Kirishima...
To protect Touka and Ayato, sister...
I know...
I was the one who tried to ease the blame.
Because of me...
these children...
decided to get angry.
It's really hard to protect someone.
In the end, you can lose more than you wanted to protect.
But...
you don't think about such things.
When you want to be able to protect your loved ones.
These two...
I'll protect them.
What is it?
What is it, what is it?
What is it?
Step aside.
I don't want to.
But it looks like we'll have to fight.
Step aside.
Why did you come?
You're not the only one who wants to save Hinami.
You've grown up, brother.
Don't worry about me.
Save Hinami.
What a fool.
Are you ready?
Yes.
Take yourself in your hands, old man!
What am I?
It hurts.
What exactly is it that hurts?
Looking at your restless face from Sozaki,
it hurts so much for some reason.
Like this.
Kijima!
Tooth.
Big finger punch.
Let's go.
Tooth.
And I...
Tooth.
Decided to take everything from me.
Arima.
My sister, hopes and dreams.
In this world of constant losses.
I want to have a connection with someone.
To show everything I've done.
To make sense of it all.
That's my hope.
This time I will definitely protect.
Arima.
Yama!
To be continued...
And I...
Yes.
Kaneki.
See you soon.
I'm sorry, Tohka.
But that won't happen.
Hinami.
Ayato.
Let's go home.
Sister.
Stupid Hinami.
I'm sorry.
You have no doubt or confusion.
Arima.
I don't want to fight you.
Am I the only one?
We practiced many times.
But this is our first real fight.
It may be very small, but in your defense there is a bridge.
To the left of me is your right side.
You have a delay here.
I will aim there.
Take it seriously.
Take it seriously.
Wow.
It smells like blood.
I managed to turn it off.
That's how we'll get out of here.
I'm sure you don't want to stay with him.
If only he stayed.
Would he have to protect me?
We will believe in Ken.
I turned everything on.
Well?
You want to die again?
645.
That's how many times I had the opportunity to kill you.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
That's how many times I had the opportunity to kill you.
And that's how many times I decided not to do it.
So what did you decide?
I will stop you, Arima.
Enough.
I just wasted time on you.
See you soon.
Are you getting serious now?
My queen.
To the basement.
I made this escape.
You're the first one I use it on.
Come on, Kaneki Ken.
Wow.
You're trying so hard, boy.
I think it's time for me to try too.
For the sake of little Hina.
Disgusting.
And yet, today is the day.
Disgusting.
And yet, today is the day.
How are you guys doing?
Thank you for the treat.
Can I have some more?
What was that?
Hurry up.
What was that?
From the bottom?
Did you manage to escape the rest?
They're all right.
I think that's enough.
Hey.
What do you mean, that's enough?
I don't think so.
I don't think so.
I don't think so.
I don't think so.
I don't think so.
What do you mean, that's enough?
Hina.
Do you think you've won enough time?
And that your job is done?
You'll never change.
But I can't.
Win it?
Of course you can.
You think so?
Of course.
I don't think so.
Hina.
Yes?
I...
You know...
I miss you so much.
Stop crying.
You just didn't find a reason to live.
You'll find another one, don't worry.
Go on.
Don't let your life go to waste.
Oh, Kaneki.
You wanted to give your life for others, didn't you?
You know...
I wanted us to keep on living.
I'm gonna say it.
No matter how it sounds.
Live.
No matter how often I change my mind.
The same thing happens.
Useless.
Strange.
Stupid.
Indecisive.
And weak.
But...
It's...
Me.
All the special-class agents are dead.
Maybe we should talk?
Maybe we should start from scratch?
If I say sorry...
No.
Of course not.
I'd better run away from the past.
Hey, don't move.
Damn, she's angry.
Stupid.
What a beautiful sight.
Violence is wrong.
And that's why...
I'm gonna kill you.
Let's find a peaceful solution.
I know it won't be easy.
But...
I have to win.
Oh...
Can I say you gave up?
Damn, I'm so glad you went through Kano's procedure.
It's Kagune.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
It's Kagune.
Rize.
Right.
I'm the same as Kaneki.
Kagune Rize is amazing and beautiful.
Furuta ni Mura.
You don't serve neither you nor Vi.
Then what do you want?
Peace in the whole world.
That's all.
Hey, can you die already?
What the hell?
This is the end.
In its current state.
The battle is not over.
The enemy is alive.
I didn't expect anything else.
That's enough.
The battle is over.
It's just...
It's sad.
You don't want to kill me?
Yes.
I lost.
I lost.
I lost.
I lost.
I lost.
I was an investigator for 18 years.
And for the first time I have nothing to oppose the enemy.
I'll ask you again.
Are you really not going to kill me?
I won't change my mind.
Okay.
THE END
