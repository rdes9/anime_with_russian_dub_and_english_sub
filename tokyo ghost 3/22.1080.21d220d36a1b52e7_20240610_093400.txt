Come on, after everything is over,
the killer returns,
then he is forced on the hour after.
Come on, from the top,
and the pest is dangerous log.
How did you see that?
I just wanna show you
some portrayal of the finish line.
Good goat!
Sort of like a defense line.
Tell you what?
Guys, I have to go. I have to come back.
I have to go.
I have to go.
What is it?
Where are you going, murderer?

I need to save the others.
Help! Help!
No! No! Don't!
Please, spare my child!
Takiskiy gul. Rebirth
This is...
Yes.
The voices of the people you killed.
I didn't want this.
To protect everyone?
To create a world where gul and people will understand each other?
All these people died because of you.
You shouldn't have interfered from the very beginning.
Look.
The people we killed fill the ocean.
Oh, right.
Did you forget that you don't care about the death of others?
I didn't know...
...that you would die.
I didn't know...
...that everything would turn out like this.
So it's okay to kill if you didn't know or didn't want to?
No.
Then why did you do it?
Because you're cruel?
No.
Do you consider yourself a hero?
That's not true.
Then are you a villain?
I don't know.
So you fight for no reason?
I...
I wanted to be someone I needed.
Anteiko.
Ever since Yashimura gave me coffee for the first time...
...I looked at the world anew.
I became friends with many guls.
Even when I became Heisei, Arima and Eto...
...they chose me.
Touka...
...was by my side.
I felt like I was needed.
I was happy.
And I thought I could belong to both worlds.
Everything you said...
...I don't care about others.
I don't care about great goals.
Ever since I fought...
...I thought I would be needed by someone.
Remember, you said I hated you.
And now I hate you.
If I hadn't met you...
...all of this wouldn't have happened to me.
I didn't understand why you didn't think the same way.
I didn't understand why you didn't think the same way.
I didn't understand why you didn't think the same way.
What do you think now?
Do you hate me?
I thought...
...about all the pain I had to go through...
...when I was on the verge of death.
About all the difficulties.
It was necessary.
Otherwise I wouldn't have met them all.
The people I was happy to meet...
...and the people I needed.
Because even now...
...I have no hatred for you.
Because...
Exactly.
I...
...was happy.
Are you leaving?
Are you going to cross the sea of blood...
...and leave all your sins behind?
Let's see if I can hold this knife.
I see.
I guess I won't mind if you drown.
Episode 22.
The end of the tragedy.
Call.
He's alive, isn't he?
If you're talking about whether he has a mask activity...
...then yes, he's alive.
Damn it.
You'll be dead forever.
You'll be dead forever.
You'll be dead forever.
Damn it.
You'll be dead forever.
Let me fight a little, Kaneki.
Brother!
It's too sad here.
The flowers won't stop.
Mom!
Segula.
They're all gathered in Sasaki's room.
It seems so.
He's very dear to them.
Will you visit him?
I think you want to see him.
I don't have the right to do that.
Go tell him about what happened.
Otherwise, nothing will change.
Uri.
There are a whole bunch of things in the world...
...that you can't handle on your own.
Like me.
I couldn't handle it on my own.
I've been saved so many times.
Everyone is trying to get on their feet.
What's going to happen to Golia now?
What do you think, former CCG employee Hiragatake?
Coexistence and struggle are not the main thing.
Even if people of Guli can grow their conflict...
...there will be big changes.
That's what Arima said.
Since you've resigned.
Obviously, it's a serious matter.
Are you offended, Ito?
Arima also said that...
...all people will become Guli.
Damn it!
I can't even breathe!
With this pace!
He's got an attack!
Hurry!
What the hell?
What's going on?
What's going on?
Oh, come on!
You really woke up!
Uh...
Why are you here with Kimi...
...and Saiko?
There's a lot of danger ahead of us.
Not just them.
Right now, all members of Kazai and Golub are working together.
CCG...
...and Guli?
But why?
To save you.
That's why Nagachika brought CCG and Guli together.
Hideo...
He...
He's alive.
Hideo is alive!
The city...
...will you show it to me?
Can I?
Don't overdo it.
I'll go with him.
I'll go with him.
I'll go with him.
I'll go with him.
I'll go with him.
Urie...
If you have something to say, say it, Sasaki.
Uh...
At least I'll listen.
You can't come up with anything good anyway.
Thank you, Urie.
What is it, you're not afraid of her?
Over there.
Guli...
Don't!
Please, forgive me!
I... I was so hungry!
Please!
Let me go!
Let me go!
Commander, it's Guli.
She's a human.
An office worker from CCG headquarters in District 20.
Hey!
Everybody can hear me!
Look!
Monsters eat people!
It's a symbol of the upcoming apocalypse!
Let's interview one of the monsters.
What's your name?
Looks like he's not in the mood.
What is it?
Self-defense forces have arrived.
Let's see them for work.
All the monsters have exploded.
Hey, what is this?
What is it?
It looks like something strange has happened.
So, let's see what you're going to do.
Where's the transmission coming from?
Looks like it.
He's got a transfer station.
Talk, Urie.
We're close.
We're moving out to the point.
Got it.
I'll send reinforcements immediately.
Mr. Marouda.
What?
These explosions...
It's not good.
There's no one here?
Look closer!
From those soldiers that are lying on the ground,
it looks like something's growing out of them.
It's a record.
There's no furuta here.
Doesn't it look like a hypersecretion of RC cells?
By inhaling the poison from those creatures,
they've started to turn into ghouls.
God, what's going to happen to humanity?
Do your best, guys.
Damn it.
Furuta.
Shaiqa.
Sasaki.
I'm looking for Russia.
Take her to the headquarters.
But Urie,
these things are poisonous.
Go away.
You're the one who has to go.
What are you talking about?
Don't be stupid.
I got poisoned here.
That's why I'm staying.
I'm going to fight.
We won't leave you.
What if I lose control of my strength again?
I'm back thanks to them.
Everyone's waiting for me there.
I don't want them to be sad again.
But if Urie and Shaiqa are...
What should I do?
What should I do?
Become useless again.
Be useless.
I don't want to.
Sasaki.
Let's go.
Let's go.
What will happen to her now?
Her RC cell level has exceeded 1000.
Technically, she's a ghoul now.
It looks like people are really turning into ghouls.
If she doesn't stabilize,
we won't be able to analyze the symptoms.
Shaiqa.
Urie.
Hi.
Hi.
So you're alive.
Yes.
Can you show me your face?
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm not painted right now.
I'm shy.
I want to see what I've done.
God.
Thank you.
You've always been hiding what I didn't want to see.
You've always been protecting me.
Yes.
You understand me.
I'm going to carry this knife.
For this city.
For your wounds.
I'll do everything I can.
With your help.
I don't want to be helpless anymore.
I don't want to be alone.
I don't want to be alone.
I don't want to be alone.
I don't want to be alone.
I don't want to be alone.
I don't want to be alone.
I don't want to be alone.
I don't want to be alone.
I don't want to be alone.
I don't want to be alone.
I don't want to be alone.
I don't want to be alone.
I don't want to be alone.
I don't want to be alone.
I don't want to be alone.
I don't want to be alone.
