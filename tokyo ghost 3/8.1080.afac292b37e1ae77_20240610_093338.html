        <pre>Mr. Mirumo, I have some news for you.
It's because of hunger, Mr. Shu.
Kabuna can't control it anymore.
At this pace, Mr. Shu...
It's going to break.
Yes.
Aaaaaaah!
Aaaaaaah!
Aaaaaaah!
Aaaaaaah!
Mr. Mirumo.
I'm sorry.
I've lost control of myself.
Mr. Shu.
Hey.
You're Kanae von Roosevelt, aren't you?
I'm Tsukiyama Shu.
I heard that we have a new servant.
Are you used to this place?
Roosevelt?
So it's the Rose Forest?
Let's go, Little Boy.
I'll show you the real Rose Forest.
Look.
It's a duvet.
It's a noble German rose.
Kanae.
Even though it's far away, we're blood relatives.
Don't cry alone.
Live proudly and beautifully.
Like a rose.
This is the duty of everyone in Tsukiyama's family.
Kanae!
Mr. Shu.
Mr. Shu!
Kagune.
Forgive me.
Who are you taking me for?
Kanae!
I'm Kurman.
Bring me the perfect dish.
The one that will be worthy of me.
Calm down.
Mr. Shu.
Kanae.
What are you doing here?
I was cleaning your room while you were sleeping.
I see.
Thank you.
Please forgive me for my appearance.
No.
I need to.
Please.
Continue to take care of this family.
Yes.
Kanae!
Kanae!
Hase! Hase! Hase!
Hase! Hase!
Even my loyalty...
I hate it.

Episode 8, The Accelerator
It's impossible not to escape from Kukuri.
How many times do I have to repeat you?
What about Geryon?
He's dead.
What about Geryon?
He's dead.

Geryon?
What about Geryon?
You and Fueguchi were acting on your own free will.
We just need to replace her.
Totoro.
Yemuri, Bin brothers.
Everyone we've lost.
All Aogir members are just pawns for you that can be replaced.
Yes.
A dog should behave like a dog.
It's...
Congratulations.
Chimera's claws are a very rare thing.
Well, Shirogin.
Maybe you can open it?
I want...
to be beautiful.
Shirazu!
Are you unwell?
Are you unwell?
Quinkies.
They make you unwell.
Especially when you get the first quinkie from the victim, Gouli.
That's not the point.
I'm fine.
Hey, Sasan.
The prize for destroying the quinkie.
A million seven hundred thousand.
That's a lot.
Who knows?
If you're going to cry, then get out.
Annoying stupid girl.
What's so funny?
I'm sorry.
It's just...
When you're angry, you look like Sister Tsutouko.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
It's easier for me.
Hinami.
Thank you for the information.
Yes.
Exactly.
Here.
Thank you.
Brother.
I am me.
And you are you.
Before, when I was sad, you brought me books just like that.
And even now, I don't know how to react.
I think many people feel the same.
Because we all loved you very much.
I'm sorry.
I can't be a quinkie.
I'll go in.
Why do I sympathize with Gull?
When the time comes, I want to help her.
Who am I?
Who am I?
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm not eavesdropping at all or something like that.
You're whining again, Furuta.
So-so.
My name is Kijima.
Sasaki...
Heisei.
I already know.
Huh?
We were entrusted to do the rose business.
You'd better be careful with the old man.
And now I'm sorry.
Let's go, Furuta.
I'm sorry.
Kujo.
Why are you so interested in Mr. Shu?
It's fun, isn't it?
I think so.
Tell me, mouse.
How were you going to save Mr. Shu?
Here.
Horichiyo, right?
You are suspected of helping Gull.
Please come with us.
Stop!
Tsukiyama, you won't believe it.
But I'm really afraid of death.
That's why...
If I die, I want to choose the moment myself.
And until then, I want to have as much fun as I can.
Come on, bunny, get up.
You not only woke me up, but also didn't let me have breakfast.
Because you didn't get out of bed.
Damn.
The head of 3DS-1, Ui Koori.
I'll be in charge of the investigation.
Nice to meet you.
Ui Koori, a special class investigator.
And Hihiro, a senior investigator.
Fura Taishi, a senior investigator.
Due to the lack of approval and the massive number of victims,
we believe that the Rose Group is well trained.
We believe that the Rose Group is well trained.
We believe that Rose Group is well trained.
We believe that Rose Group is well trained.
They almost don't leave traces, so it's really difficult.
We need the most effective method of investigation.
Effective method, huh?
There's almost no information.
Excuse me.
You're the Queens, aren't you?
Uh, yeah. What's going on?
You're nervous, aren't you?
Of course not, you fool!
Commander, I'm back!
Oh, I'm Ui's partner investigator.
My name is Hihihiro.
You know, we're almost the same age.
I really hope that we can get along well with you.
Same age?
That's strange.
To help a special class at this age?
Let's go, Senior Investigator Hihi.
Uh, yeah.
Senior Investigator Hihi?
She's from the ARIMA detachment.
She was involved in the destruction of the owl.
So she was in the vanguard?
That's nonsense.
Hihihiro was in Class 7-4.
She was three years older than us.
Oh, it's no surprise that we don't know her.
Captain!
I need backup.
I heard there's a bakery nearby.
Let's check it out.
Huh?
We have to gather information now.
Oh, come on.
You didn't have breakfast after all.
Well, let's go.
It smells so good!
They look good too.
Welcome...
Huh?
You're Kuroiwa, right?
Huh?
Do you know her?
Kosuke?
Here, better with coffee.
Oh, thank you.
You have very tasty bread.
Thank you very much.
Kuroiwa, you became an investigator, didn't you?
Yes.
Your father was also an investigator, wasn't he?
Yes.
Was Kuroiwa always like that?
Yes.
He was always silent.
But he was very good to himself.
And he was good at sports.
Kosuke...
Are you a baker?
Yes.
I always dreamed of baking bread for a cafe.
Great!
Damn, we have to go back.
Although there is nothing to report.
We can report in excellent baking.
Kosuke...
The bread was very tasty.
Come on in, Kuroiwa.
What the hell?
What the hell is going on?
Kuroiwa, you've always been a great bait.
You don't look like a compliment.
Even if there are no traces, we can predict your appearance.
This is a trap.
The wall.
Separate the Kagune.
Let's go.
You're not going anywhere.
Good evening.
Is it open?
Yes.
Incredible.
Are you looking for something specific?
Well, I...
I wanted to ask you about this.
It was delivered to me, and you were the sender, right?
What?
I really sent it.
How strange.
I don't understand.
Really?
By the way...
Did you send this book?
No, I didn't.
I see.
I'm sorry.
And I'm sorry for asking.
Your eyes.
Oh, this tattoo.
The ink is inserted into the eye.
I see.
I see.
This tattoo.
The ink is inserted into the eye.
They come out over time.
I see.
It must hurt.
Yes, you can take this mask.
No, leave it to yourself.
It's okay.
It must be fate that it came to you.
Well, then thank you.
More?
Yes.
Is it possible to make a mask for an order?
Yes.
What a great trick.
Then...
Again?
You're so cool.
But I just warmed up.
Who is this girl?
How does she turn around?
I'm fast.
Madam!
Yuma!
I am extremely grateful to you for distracting them, investigator Hey.
Is it about Rose and S1?
Yes.
Apparently they have already caught one of them.
Well, I'm also a special class.
I will take advantage of everything you have learned in Germany against Auggire.
With the current administration, Auggire is not for us.
With the current administration, it is...
Everything you have learned in Germany is not to let your people die in vain.
I'm very sorry.
Mr. Miruma.
It's all my fault.
It's okay, Matsumaya.
I'm glad you're okay.
Where is Yuma?
Alisa.
I'm sorry.
CCG found us.
Now it will be more difficult to hunt.
But then Mr. Shu will be.
Does it hurt?
It's okay.
I just need to rest.
Do what you have to do.
There are a couple of photos in this envelope.
Can you show them to Tsukiyama?
You promised to help Tsukiyama in everything.
I understand everything.
I'm absolutely sure you won't tell me anything, no matter how hard I try.
And so I decided to send a gift to your friends.
What do you think?
What piece will they like?
Promise me one thing.
No matter what, you must respect Tsukiyama's wish.
If you can, give him these photos.
Kanae.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
What are you choosing?
