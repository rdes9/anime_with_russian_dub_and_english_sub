Detective Kuraeva
Hmm?
Why did you decide to come with me?
I heard that you're a friend
A friend?
My son always said
Uria is a great friend and an opponent
And you
You remind me of Mikito
Question?
But today is such an important day
You can refuse
But it will be stated in the report
So you want to be sure in my psychological state
Are you kidding?
I would like to ask you a question
What do you need
for proof?
Of course
Huh?
Witnesses
Just make sure that everyone is safe
Kaneki!
Run!
Run!
We will detain them
Yes
Monsignor Yoma
Monsignor Yoma
Monsignor Yoma
Sister!
Take the children and run!
But how?
Faster!
So it's you
Here you will die
You can do it without a queen
I can do something
I'm in the office of CCG
It's fun
Hi
Sheko, I'll help you now
What?
Eggplant!
Enough!
Please!
Please!
Don't!
This technique you used on the investigator Shibashi
I read the report, you know
No imagination
It turns out you are at the same time with Gulem
It won't go away from you, Furuta
From behind
Tell me, boy
What kind of common enemy do people and Gule have?
How many?
This world is a big circus
Useless fun
Disgusting
Silly mother
SSS run
Well, let's start
Shiveri to the left
Ui to the right
Not bad
Worthy opponents
Motherfucker!
It's all your fault!
What are you doing, wounded old fool?
Leave me alone and run!
Hi-ya!
Ouch!
I know, I'm not in the right place now, but I realized that the chicken still appeared earlier than the egg.
I got knocked out.
Director!
Oh, I see you're done.
Let's go have dinner.
Maybe we'll eat the Senior Investigator with rice.
Great, see you soon!
Great!
You won't last that long.
It hurts.
They have the same kaguna as Risa.
No, like I have.
And the regeneration...
I can't wait.
Damn, you're in the way.
Could you back off?
Haisa...
You know what?
I'm going to kill you.

I don't understand, Hirako.
Why did Arima entrust this to you?
He did it because he believed in me.
That's why I'm going to fight for him, no matter what.
He didn't entrust this task to you because he believed in you.
That you would do the right thing, no matter what.
I don't understand what you're talking about.

Why didn't you finish me off?
Our king was giving orders.
If you did, maybe you could travel the world with me and live it with me,
Or so I think.
I hope you understand where I'm coming from.
Cheers.
Ohhh!
My cunning body!
Hamburger!
I'm here!

Good night!
So?
Dunno
The shield?
What?
How interesting.

Detective!
Detective!
I wanted to apologize to you all this time.
For not being able to protect Mickey.
I wish I was stronger.
I'm sorry.
It's my fault.
Not at all!
It's not your fault!
No!
Not whose fault!
That's right.
I hated myself for my own helplessness.
I was too young.
I couldn't handle what happened.
To take it all out, I just put the blame on others.
You look very much like Mickey.
Detective!
What a great ball!
Cool!
Oh my god.
You're making too much noise.
What?
Oh my god.
Oh my god.
Oh my god.
Oh my god.
What?
Detective Marouda?
What kind of face is that, Eva?
Marou.
I'm here.
Next to you.
I won't leave you.
I promise.
I'll always be next to you.
Detective Marouda.
Explain what's going on.
Who are you?
My name is Hideyoshi Nogachika.
Help me, Uriya.
Help me!
Please!

I have no chance.
But your head is still in place.
Are you still breathing?
Yes.
You can still bite.
I can.
And crawl?
I can.
Then you know what to do.
The same as always.
Do not doubt.
Go ahead.
Just like a rock.
