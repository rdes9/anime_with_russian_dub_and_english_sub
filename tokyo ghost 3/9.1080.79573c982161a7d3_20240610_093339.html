He
Everything's going to be alright.
Kaneki couldn't have forgotten me.
Let's enjoy time together again.
Let's bring back the lost time.
Kaneki...
Kaneki...
Um...
Is everything alright with you?
Crazy suit.
I'm sorry.
I wonder if he's alright.
How strange.
He didn't recognize me.
He's gone crazy.
He's going to jump out like a pigeon.
Episode 9. The ghost.
Welcome.
What, a ghost?
Hello.
Hello Sasaki.
We came here to make a mask for everyone.
A mask?
Why do we need a mask?
We're not ghouls.
That's right.
We're going to be ghouls.
First we changed our clothes, and now we're going to be ghouls?
We have a cocoon and similar abilities.
That's why we can go after ghouls.
And why would we do that?
We'll get into the world of ghouls.
You have sharp teeth and a cool look.
Do you have a girlfriend?
No, I don't.
Or you don't like him?
Do you like someone now?
I'm not entirely sure.
You look serious and smart.
Can I make you a strange mask?
Why?
Because it will be fun.
This guy is definitely a ghoul.
Maybe we should interrogate him?
You're so small, like a forest spirit.
My name is Saiko.
What are you into?
Playing, sleeping, having a snack, reading manga and watching anime.
Cute bandages.
Do you like them?
Yes.
You have such a cute face.
Muscular, but gentle.
I think you'd like girls' clothes.
I've already heard that voice.
Sasan, it's great that we got the measurements,
but do we have permission to do that?
I'm coming for him.
No.
Masking for ghouls?
It will put you as an investigator under suspicion.
But...
Sasaki, can there be justice without common sense?
I understand.
I'm sorry.
I think the idea with masks is good.
They're like scary superheroes.
Superheroes, huh?
Can I smoke?
Your wife will get mad, investigator.
That's why I smoke here.
Maybe you're just afraid that Sasaki will put you in danger?
He's a threat to us.
Mr. Arima, hi, son!
He lost control of Kaguna.
Here's the idiot.
Kuri, I'll take care of him.
Sasaki...
Ghoul.
I heard that Shu went for a walk.
That's great news.
It's really good.
Mr. Shu's appetite is coming back to normal.
Where's Shu now?
I think he's in his room.
He's studying something.
You don't remember me?
This won't do.
I'll make you remember.
Maybe Squash will start?
I'm so nostalgic.
Mr. Morima!
Sati Sejri?
Rosa?
Hello, Rosa.
For our convenience.
I decided to show you how we work with your friend.
We caught him recently.
We continued our investigation.
But he wasn't in the mood to talk.
In this case, I decided that he doesn't need the language anymore.
That's it.
That's it.
He doesn't need the language anymore.
Oh my God.
He had a lot of unnecessary organs.
But I only know about their location.
My name is Kijima Shiki.
I'm sure you won't forget this face.
You can try to kill me at any time.
I'll be waiting, Rosa.
Kijima researchers.
What have you come up with?
Everyone can see this video.
Yes, and because of this we have a lot of views.
Are you trying to lure them by torturing their comrades?
Did you make a living out of yourself?
Don't you understand the danger?
I'm ready to take a risk.
After all, I don't care about my life.
This violates the law of countermeasures.
Indeed, and I'm going to report on this.
So I'm sorry.
If I'm not removed from the group, we'll see each other again.
Crazy.
Sasan.
Have you seen the video?
Such a method.
You're too cruel.
There must be another way.
But we have to kill them.
Huh?
It's okay.
It's my fault that you were caught.
Lizzie is very hurt.
In order to feed me, you all had to hunt more.
Mr. Shiki, I'm sorry.
He was caught for our incompetence.
You don't have to take responsibility for yourself.
Matsumae, Milo.
I just...
I just want to see Lizzie's smile again.
A plan to save?
Yes.
A plan to save Lizzie.
And Kaneki will be our key.
If we use his position, we can find an effective way.
But Mr. Shu, will Sasaki Heisei listen to you?
Right, it's difficult in his position.
But if it's Kaneki, there will be no problem.
He will agree.
As soon as memory returns to him, everything will be fine.
I believe that in his soul, Kaneki does not want to be an investigator.
I'm glad about Mr. Shu's optimism, but...
I see.
But that's what I expected.
Okay.
Now show him the photo number two.
Respect his wish, no matter what.
Little mouse, don't say that.
That's my rule.
Together forever.
Glory.
Hi.
We met.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
We met.
Thank you for that day.
Oh, Kaneki.
You look better today.
Do you mind if I sit down?
Yes, of course.
Kaneki, do you really not remember me?
All those beautiful days.
Are you into books?
Yes.
I always read in my free time.
Well, of course.
I also like reading.
I'm sure you like the work of Takatsuki.
Now I know more about you than you know about Kaneki.
Yes, but they are not exactly to my liking.
In her books, those who are close to the protagonist or the protagonist himself always die.
It's so sad.
That's how it is.
Hey, hey, why?
Calm down, Shu.
As you can see, I don't feel well.
And I don't have any friends from school.
If you don't mind, maybe we can discuss the books again.
Mom!
You kids are a hindrance.
I'm sorry, I have to go back to work.
Take care of yourself.
Kanne!
Mr. Shu!
It's okay.
We can try again.
Shirazu, we're late for the meeting.
Sensei!
Damn it, the puppies keep getting in the way of me talking to Kaneki.
Mr. Shu, take it.
Kaneki?
Haori did it?
My little friend.
She understands me perfectly.
Haori, please tell me.
What does Gurman mean?
I don't know.
Try to guess.
Hey, Tsukiyama!
You would have died for the ingredients.
I'd like to talk to that mouse again.
I wonder what happened to the others.
The guys and Juntaiku, the puppies, Yanami and others.
Do they know that Kaneki is alive?
I'm sure they don't want to see him.
Mr. Shu!
I'll give you a little time.
Are you from the tree, Oogiri?
I have a job for you.
How are the other units doing?
I don't think there's any serious evidence.
It looks like the enemy was alerted after the video.
So we just wait for them to come after Kejima.
Shirazu.
He was at the auction.
Shirazu, Uri!
The boy has already started.
Maybe we should go, too.
Now you're caught!
Great chance to test yourself.
You can do it without a nanny.
Borg!
Shirazu, Uri!
It's them.
Look, Shusui, we have a bunch of kids here.
White costumes.
What did they forget about Oogiri here?
Damn, do we all need that here?
Hey, Uri, this is a very important job.
The more we prepare, the better.
Yeah, we need to finish what we couldn't.
What?
I'll cover you.
No, get to Shirazu and Uri.
Got it.
Let's go, Saika.
Hey, was he even in the photo?
I'm not sure.
So, what are you doing?
Fixing up a couple of investigators.
Your goals are in this photo.
Can you do it?
Four pigeons.
This is your advance.
You'll get double for every victim.
I don't remember.
We'll kill him anyway.
Mom!
Sensei will be fine.
Now it's more important to find Shirazu and Uri.
Toru!
I'm here.
Toru?
You changed your hairstyle.
It suits you.
She's very cute.
Hide.
You're strong.
No, you're stronger.
Amazing.
My Toru is the best.
I'll make you mine.
Even if you're strong.
This knife unites us.
I like it even stronger.
Let's get even closer, Toru.
Cut me, cut me.
Cut, cut, cut, cut me.
Cut me.
Are you okay, Toru Sato?
Toru.
Toru.
It looks like you're a baron.
Toru, Toru, Toru.
It's not Kagura.
It's...
...Quinker.
My Kakuho.
Now Kagura doesn't work.
What are you doing, idiot?
Use Quinker.
Exactly.
Quinker.
Me too, commander.
I just need...
...Kaguya.
Kaguya.
Kaguya.
I just need...
...to show myself.
Kagura.
He's gotten so much stronger.
I'll break your neck.
Damn it.
He escaped.
But it's okay.
I got him.
Let's go.
Huh?
It's a trap.
It's fast.
Just a little more.
I got you.
Interesting.
So, we both, Kaku.
Let's see who's better.
My name is Rasshitite, face of the grave.
And I'll take your Quinker.
That's it?
Damn it.
Mutsuki, back.
Shirazu.
Come on.
Put it on me.
They have a Kaku.
We need to retreat.
Are you okay, Toru?
Yeah.
Let's go back.
I was told to hide.
But I don't know when to come back.
Mutsuki is alone.
Wow.
You're cute.
Like a doll.
Like a bun.
Eat, eat, eat.
I'll break it.
If you move, I'll break your bones.
Help.
What?
Let's retreat.
They'll eat us alive.
Susie.
Guys, are you okay?
Yeah, I think so.
Why did they come after us?
I'm not sure.
But it looks like there's some kind of connection between the Aogiri tree and the rose.
Where's Saiko?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I'm so hungry.
Susie.
Thank you.
Saiko.
Thank God.
Are you okay?
Mom, there was a big guy in black.

I hope you'll let us continue.

I came as soon as I could.
The helicopter won't come here soon.

Don't move.
