        <pre>The building of the lunar eclipse is cleared by 81 percent.
Everything except the roof and a couple of upper floors.
I will deserve great praise, if I lead the operation.
What easy money.
It will be.
Is this one-eyed mule?
What is it?
What is it?
What is it?
What is it?
What is it?
What is it?
What is it?
What is it?

Konneki!
Haise!
I wish I could bow down to you!
You want to be punished, don't you, Sasaki Haise?
Well, now dance!
My unwavering baby!
You're not going to burst yet!
Come on!
There's not enough time!
You're going to die soon!
Let your Mr. Sho see!
Excellent!
I will be loved!
I will be loved!
Loved!
I will be loved!
I will be loved!
I will be loved!
I will be loved!
Hey, aren't you going to save me?
Shut up!
I should die!
My salvation!
Konneki!
Die!
I don't want to be happy!
Your salvation!
Die!
I want to disappear!
Die!
I should have died long ago!
Die!
Kill me, Haise!
Die!
I want to disappear!
Hey, don't you remember?
I was often beaten for all kinds of stupid things.
Mommy, I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
I don't want anything!
I'm sorry!
I loved my mom.
I was happy then.
The flower field underground, I didn't think I would meet the God of Death.
I graduated just like my mom.
Like an insect.
But I didn't die.
Did I want to die?
Yes, I know.
That's why I want to do something this time.
I want others to love me.
And I want to die beautifully.
Is this...
Is this your salvation?
Yeah.
It seems your salvation is just a sweet dream.
For me, to be honest,
I woke up, cried a little and that's it.
I made a mistake when I decided that I was allowed to live.
Can you?
Yes.
Good night, Haise.
Good night, Haise.
I've had enough dreams.
Oh my God!
That's enough!
Stop talking!
Episode 12.
The dawn.
Stop the bleeding!
Kori!
It's very tasty!
Kori!
It's very tasty!
Commander!
Is the survivor here?
Just a moment.
Kijima!
Can you talk?
Kijima!
Kijima!
Kijima!
Kijima!
Kijima!
Kijima!
Don't worry.
Thank you for the pitiful story of awakening, but now I wonder who is stronger, you or Ariman?
You're the only one who's pitiful here. Die.
Sasan, what's wrong with you?
We have Prince Uri Izmoton, Mutsuki Saika is safe.
I don't know about the others. If I don't do anything, then everyone will die.
Kuramoto, Kuraiba, Uri Mutsuki Saika, and even me. I can't die and leave Haru.
One more. One more. One more, one more, one more, one more, one more!
Shirazu!
You must die, monster!
Uriya, do you think that's enough?
If he recovers, I can't do anything else.
Shirazu!
Kuzen, is that her?
My Eto. I gave her this name in the hope that she will receive a lot of love.
Hello, Eto. Glad to meet you.
I'll be the first, Eto.
Shirazu!
Shiragin!
Shirazu!
Shirazu!
Shirazu!
Shirazu!
Shirazu!
It seems that he has hit me hard.
The wound is too deep.
Will he recover?
Where is my
Sasaki?
Where is Sasan?
I want to see Sasan.
Sasaki will be here soon.
Calm down.
Just breathe.
Shiragin, we'll take you to the hospital.
With our regeneration, this wound is nothing.
With the right leave and a little rest, you will recover quickly.
What should I do if I really die?
Don't talk nonsense!
Shiragin!
You can do it, so...
Damn it!
Where is the doctor?
Red bean soup.
Red bean?
What a funny expression on your face.
I'll remind you of that.
Just shut up, you bald asshole!
Haru...
Your younger sister?
Right!
Your sister is waiting for you!
So get ready!
Uriya...
Saiko...
Mutsuki...
Why...
Why did you shut up?
Shirazu...
Where are you going?
Say something!
Is anyone here?
Shiragin...
I see.
It's so quiet here.
Shiragin!
It looks like I'm going to disappear.
I'm scared.
Scared...
Scared...
Everything will be fine, we're here!
I'm not afraid of her, I'm the one who's afraid of her!
Haru...
Without me...
She won't make it.
Exactly, Shirazu!
You tried to make money for your sister, didn't you?
You can't die!
You killed Gullia from the S-Range!
There are hundreds of awards, no, two hundred thousand!
All of them...
All of them are yours, Shirazu!
Please!
Shirazu?
No! No!
No!
How dare you die!
Why did you come here?
To get in my way?
To destroy?
It's boring.
It's boring to watch!
I wanted to watch you from the first rows!
Tsukiyama and Kanayru kill each other!
I'm curious!
Your father, the manager...
Anteiku.
Kouzen asked me to come.
He asked me to save you.
I'm saved!
Kaneki Ken, you're so cute!
Yeah.
Are you going to pity me?
Yeah.
Missed.
Suck it!
In fact, I wanted to know...
What would I save myself from?
You're the one who needs it.
That was a shame!
You're a piece of shit, you piece of shit!
I'll eat you!
Burn yourself to death!
I can't stop!
I'm not satisfied!
Kaneki!
You'll be my child!
Hey!
Why are you running away?
I think...
I like you.
What do you mean? We look so much alike.
My heart is beating so fast!
I love you, Kaneki Ken!
I'm so embarrassed, Taka Tsuki.
This is crazy.
Yeah.
How many times do I have to tell you?
Who's talking to me?
Your investigatorthere!
Why are you so ahead of us?
Is somebody else standing in for the fight?
The One-Eyed Gu screaming!
We need people.
Uraii Watakiomi and Urii Kuki.
Can you fight me?
Urii! Are you listening to me?!
So you don't care what happened here?
Yes. I thought you could follow me.
Don't worry.
Uri Kukin, I thought you had potential.
Let's go.
Wait.
I heard something.
Detective Sasaki?
Is that you?
I'm sorry.
I was seriously injured in a fight with an owl.
I recovered my strength.
Did you manage to save her alone?
No.
She ran away at the last minute.
I'm sure the owl is still alive.
I see.
As expected, the Tsukiyama family and the Aogiri tree are connected.
The one lying there is one of the Tsukiyama family's servants.
Detective Uri.
I'll take care of him myself.
Okay.
Leave the other one to me.
Kaneki.
So this is the way.
You chose it.
Mr. Sho!
Mr. Sho!
Goodbye, Tsukiyama.
Mr. Sho!
Kana, let go.
You're alive.
I don't want to.
Even if my body breaks apart, I'll protect you.
You're everything to me.
Let me have one selfish wish.
I've always dreamed of you calling me by my name.
My real name.
Oh, my beloved Mr. Sho.
I'm so embarrassed by my wish.
Father, mother, brothers.
Forgive me.
And you, Mr. Sho.
Forgive me for falling in love with you.
Forgive me.
It's all right.
Nobody will steal you, Kara.
I've been unlucky all my life.
I couldn't be who I am.
But what makes me happy is that I can die who I was born to be.
Oh, really?
I was able to receive the blessing.
Shirazu.
I wanted to see you.
If only you had come earlier.
So it's my fault?
Who was fighting with him then?
Uriya.
You lost everything because you didn't have enough strength.
If you want to blame someone, blame your weakness.
