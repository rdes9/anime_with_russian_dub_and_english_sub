The dragon again began to give signs of life.
And more and more people continue to turn into Guli.
How can he continue to move without Koneki inside?
Please have a look.
There is another core inside.
Another core?
It looks like we should do it.
If so, let's send someone to investigate.
There is no time.
At all?
According to preliminary data.
In the worst case, 12 hours.
What if the dragon wakes up again?
People all over Tokyo will turn into Guli.
Yes, it is clearly not up to the investigation.
Also, a trace of poison is leading to the core,
stretching along the subway.
And what if Guli goes?
Even for Guli, such a concentration of RC cells
can be critical.
Send me there.
After all, my body has immunity to poison.
And the truth is that the concentration of RC cells in the body
has almost not changed.
But even so ...
We are attacked?
There are so many of them.
They probably decided to kill everyone.
You can't slow down.
I'm going to the core.
Kimi, will you guide me?
The rest of you stay here and cover the CCG.
I'm coming too.
Ayato, where have you been?
I was trying to study the underground part of the monster.
Ayato, Kaneki.
Be sure to come back.
Yes.
Let's go.
Episode 23.
Clash. Action.
I'll tell you only one thing.
Win.
Clear?
It looks like it smells like kerosene.
We need to win time.
Right?
You got it right.
Let's use the visor.
Let's use the visor.
Let's use the visor.
Let's use the visor.
Let's use the visor.
Let's use the visor.
Let's use the visor.
Let's use the visor.
Hey!
Hey, hey, hey!
I'll punish you and Kaneki!
Shut up already.
Sensei.
It looks like we're almost done here.
Something's wrong.
Something's not right.
But they won't back down.
Hey.
What's that sound?
Hmm.
What the hell?
What's that?
Is that an owl?
You're a subordinate of Kisho.
What an irony.
Who would have thought that I would be the one
who would be lucky enough to finish this traitor.
So you took that poison?
Poison?
It's a blessing.
By throwing away my imperfect body
and getting tired of it,
I was able to finally find harmony.
This dragon is our new Noev Kovchek.
Damn it.
Kaku's squad!
Fire! Fire!
Don't stop shooting!
Suzuya!
Get out of the way, boys and girls!
Did it work?
Good.
No.
This isn't the end.
I'm starting to get used to it.
This isn't good at all.
It seems they appear underground
and then rise to the surface.
I'm getting a strong signal ahead.
Hurry up!
Why?
Why do I feel her presence?
Looks like they're waking up.
Let's jump!
Looks like there are more of them.
Kaneki!
I'll take care of them.
Go!
Only you can do this.
Don't waste your strength here.
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
I'm counting on you,
damn brother.
Damn monster!
Who else can move?
I'm checking.
Nogachi, can you hear me?
Yes.
I heard a sound before this thing appeared.
It looks like a whistle or something.
Maybe it's connected?
A whistling sound?
Open the map.
There must be some kind of controlling owl somewhere here.
Hina,
in the south,
at seven o'clock.
Sounds of engines.
Lots of voices.
Steps.
Breathing of the wounded.
The owl shakes the air.
Further.
Even further.
Much further.
Over there.
I found it!
The building in three blocks from here.
Oh,
it looks like we've been found.
Let's change the location.
Go ahead.
Okay.
Long time no see.
Long time no see,
Kotaro.
Very good,
Kotaro.
However,
you still have a long way to go.
I'm sorry,
Kotaro.
I'm sorry, Kotaro.
I'm sorry,
Kotaro.
I'm sorry,
Kotaro.
I'm sorry,
Kotaro.
I'm sorry,
Kotaro.
I'm sorry,
Kotaro.
I'm sorry,
Kotaro.
I'm sorry,
Kotaro.
I'm sorry,
Kotaro.
I'm sorry,
Kotaro.
I'm sorry,
Kotaro.
I'm sorry,
Once upon a time, I was waiting for this day,
It's been a long time since I've been waiting for this day to come when my hands will be covered with blood while I slowly pull out your heart.
How fun.
And I'm not having fun at all.
No.
No reason to have fun.
Because you're a friend.
Not to kill you, not to die, I'm not going to.
I'm so glad I have such a friend.
Renji, you're always so right and straightforward.
Because even in this world I can trust you.
I've always wanted to eat you.
So I can feel alive, Renji.
It looks like you've been hit.
I'm so happy with you, Renji.
I'm so happy with you, Renji.
Eat.
Uta, we've grown up a long time ago.
We can't fool around anymore.
But then it will be so boring, Renji.
Hey, do you remember how we both broke our legs?
And Itori took us home?
Not broken legs, not all spilled blood.
It didn't mean anything to us then.
Now it's all over.
I won't change.
Although the world around me changes so fast.
If you want to eat me, try another time.
If you want to do it, do it.
You can make as many problems as you want.
I'm not going to eat you.
I'm not going to eat you.
You can make as many problems as you want.
Because we're friends.
Well, you're right.
It looks like we've grown up.
Do you want me to give you a ride?
I'm sorry.
I simply let it go.
I never felt anything for you,
Nothing but hatred.
But I knew, knew, but continued to ignore.
I knew that this world was rotten.
There are many reasons.
And one of them was me.
I loved him.
Donato Porpora is exactly the villain you think he is.
And no matter how many people turn to gulis, or how much life breaks out, I don't care at all.
But who would have thought that I would fall into the hands of such a pickpocket of justice as you.
As it seems to me, this is the most suitable finale.
The donuts you cooked were delicious.
In the cold nights you brought the blanket.
And when our dog died, you made her a grave on the hill.
But behind your back I swallowed every child.
Are you still missing that time?
Of course.
It doesn't matter how I try to forget, how I try to hate you.
I admire the days spent in the shelter.
What's wrong in love, son, to your father?
What's wrong in love, son, to your father?
It's funny from here.
The second round.
How can I help you?
Is it true that you really hope to stop all this?
As you know, I'm very strong.
Let's go.
The second round.
The third round.
The fourth round.
The fifth round.
The sixth round.
The seventh round.
The eighth round.
The tenth round.
The tenth round.
The tenth round.
Let's go.
The sixth round.
Let's go, let's go.
The seventh round.
The tenth round.
The seventh round.
When grandpa was with you, you were very little.
Forever
Forever
Forever
Forever
Thanks
