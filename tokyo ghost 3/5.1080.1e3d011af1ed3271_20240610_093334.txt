Where are you going, Wildfang?
Hey!
Where are you going?
Seriously?
I see your wounds are getting worse.
Great!
This means that Mr. Shi will be able to enjoy himself again and again!
Mr. Shi!
Mr. Shi!
If you can regenerate quickly,
you can make your transportation easier.
Thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you!
But there's nothing I can do
I can't go back to this world
I can't go back to this world
I can't go back to this world
I can't go back to this world
I can't go back to this world
I can't go back to this world
I can't go back to this world
I can't go back to this world
But I can't go back to this world
But we can go back to this world
I'm sorry, I'm late.
Sensei!
Well done, Naori!
There's Rin Kaku.
Yeah.
I'm sorry, I'm late.
Sensei!
I'm sorry, I'm late.
That smell...
You...
Sasaki Heisei!
Episode 5
Night of Destruction
Night of Destruction
Delicious!
So delicious!
It hurts!
Back off!
A jam!
A jam, a jam, a jam!
Run!
It's useless, he'll catch up with us!
Run!
Thank you!
Give me a jam!
Ready to capture the control room.
There we'll find out where Madame and the others are.
Commander!
Upstairs!
Looks like it.
That's a jackal.
What a disgusting body.
Anabikaku Eirang!
We'll crush it with numbers!
Keep calm!
Take this!
It's incredibly hard to use Fuyaguchi.
It took me a whole year to learn it.
But now it's like a continuation of my hand.
It's like a continuation of my hand.
It's like a continuation of my hand.
It's like a continuation of my hand.
It's like a continuation of my hand.
It's like a continuation of my hand.
It's like a continuation of my hand.
You're stuck in the past.
That's why you can't change.
What?
I can't let him die.
That means I just have to kill him.
I'm stuck in the past.
My power...
My power exists only in the past.
Sadness, grief and sorrow are all that's left of me.
I can't let him die.
I can't let him die.
Sadness, grief and sorrow are all that's left of me.
What the hell do you know?
Fire!
Gagi! Gugi!
What the hell are you doing?
Fire! Fire!
We're protecting our brother!
Enough!
Hey!
Get up!
Gagi!
Gugi!
Don't leave me alone!
What about me?
What's wrong?
Find the others.
They need help.
They need help?
Yes. They need...
I have to protect Madame.
Exactly.
I'm sorry.
Looks like I have to step back.
We're out of knives.
Gagi...
It's all your fault!
It's all your fault!
It's all your fault!
It's all your fault!
Shura!
Mister...
Shura...
My...
My father...
My...
They ran away.
He separated his Kaguna?
Is that possible?
You're wrong!
Her Kaguna...
She planned it all.
They're dead.
This is Oshaba.
She has several types of Kaguna.
She uses Bikaku and Kakaku.
Her rank...
Sasaki, over.
It's yours.
Did you manage to find Detective Mutsuki?
Oshaba's squad has been destroyed.
Destroyed?
They were fighting with Chilkun.
We're increasing their rank from A to S.
I'm ordering the Queen's to get rid of Chilkun.
I'll send the Ata squad to you.
Yes, sir.
Sir...
What is it?
It's going to be very dangerous to fight Gull's S-rank.
Detective Mutsuki is wounded and exhausted.
That means he can't take part in the mission.
Let him retreat.
All right.
Send someone to protect him.
It's better to send Detective Uria.
Detective Uria?
Do you have a better idea?
No.
I understand you.
I'll send Detective Uria to take care of Mutsuki.
Thank you, Uria.
You're welcome.
It's my job.
How do you get a promotion?
You're so clumsy.
I understand.
It's a pity.
But I calmed down a little.
I don't know what I would do if I were sold at an auction.
I can imagine.
You did a good job.
Really?
I hope so.
It's too early.
I have to prove myself.
Let's go.
The exit should be there.
Got it.
I'm sorry.
I don't seem to know the area well.
This is for you.
The Ata squad will immediately go to the main building.
Detective Ata?
I got it.
It's so good.
You're shaking.
I got it.
You're scared.
It's because I'm not like you.
We're all afraid that we don't look like each other.
But if you become different, then fear is gone.
You're Tokizawa, aren't you?
You told us about you at the academy.
It's me, Togi.
You're Tokizawa, aren't you?
Don't you remember me?
Togi.
The smart girl who talked to her girlfriend during the whole lecture.
It was you.
Yes, it was.
Attention! Listen to the lecture!
Mutsuki, isn't it strange?
There are only bodyguards and Aogiri here.
The audience.
The hall was filled with golems and masks.
Considering the size of this place, there should be a lot of them.
Where could they all have gone?
I found it.
The theater basement.
Most likely, they're hiding there.
Do you want to go down?
Don't worry.
If we meet the enemy, we'll retreat.
We'll just look around.
You're so right.
I'm sick of it.
I'm sorry.
Brother.
Gagi.
Gugi.
AYATTA!
Get up, you idiot.
Ayatta!
Bingo!
Will we be able to deal with them?
Even if we kill at least a couple, and then step back.
Toru!
Detective Suzu!
What are you doing here?
I went after them and ended up here.
You shouldn't have interfered.
Do you have a radio?
We need to get in touch with the headquarters.
No.
It looks like they don't pick up the signal here.
Oh my.
Really?
I tried, but...
I brought it.
Now it's going to steal part of the glory.
What are you doing here?
Did they find a way to step back?
There are a little more of them than we do, but...
It looks like we have no choice.
Pigeons!
Me too.
There's another one here!
I'm scared.
But...
I'm an investigator too.
And you've grown.
Your skills have improved.
You've done well.
Almost to the very top.
Kuramoto.
Got it!
Takeomi!
Muscly, strong, but soft.
I can feel it.
It's a tender texture.
I'm scared!
I'm scared!
I'm scared!
Suzuya, as always, incredibly fast.
That means...
I can't hold back!
Wow, that's great.
Look, Kurei Watakeomi.
You can't beat me!
It's all because you're just a human!
No! No!
Don't do that!
Let go!
Wow, impressive.
Takuya.
That's enough.
That's right.
The hand didn't even move.
You must hate him.
And you can still...
return these things.
Great!
That's an incredible feeling!
I'll use this power to the fullest.
And then I'll become an investigator
like never before!
Uri!
Over there, madam!
I'm already moving!
I...
was chosen!
I...
You're so cute, baby.
I want to eat you.
It can't be that Uri
agreed to accompany me.
As I expected,
he went the wrong way to his goal.
Or...
he's already dead.
Uri...
Owl, where are you now?
Upstairs.
Do you see anything?
Three delicious treats.
You're from the Oshiba team, aren't you?
Heishimura.
Are you hurt?
The leaf softened the blow from the fall.
That's why I only have a couple of scratches.
Take care!
Wow!
You managed to stop me!
I can't hold him!
What a taste!
Sasan!
Back!
Sasan!
That's it!
So you're
this little bitch.
That's why you sent me.
I wonder what your flesh tastes like.
Got it!
Hold it!
You need to try harder!
I'm already used to this!
One-eyed...
pain?
Shirazu!
Back off with Heishimura!
But...
quickly!
Sasaki!
Sasaki!
Sasaki...
Sasaki!
Sasaki!
Sasaki, do something!
Sasaki!
Sasaki, do something!
development
The estimated rank of this ghoul is SS.
Detective Sasaki will fight alone.
Haishimura and the rest of Sasaki's squad will go to the main building.
What the hell!
Do you want us to drop Sasano?
And call yourself...
I got you.
Sasan!
Let's go!
Detective Shirazu!
You go there too!
Shirazu, take care of Saigo.
Yes!
What a good mentor you are!
I approve of your methods.
My boss was also a great guy.
Let's keep it a secret.
We are here together!

Maybe we should play?
Give me the strength to protect them.
The difference between a 90 and a 90...
If that's the case...
I'm strong!
