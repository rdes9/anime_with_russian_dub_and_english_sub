        <pre>Who is it?
The youngest son of the Furuta family.
Are you interested in him, Kishon?
He looks promising.
Tsunayoshi values him more than any other illegitimate child.
And yet he is the smartest in your family.
We already know his limits.
You are right, Kishon.
And yet he is the smartest in your family.
We already know his limits.

Next Time
Take care of yourself
Have a lovely day
Next time
Take care of yourself
Oh no, what is this?
Oh, take it!
Well, you didn't fall.
If so, I'll cut it.
That's not all.
I've always wanted to go all out at least once.
In fencing.
Stupid leader attacks.
Come on, come on.
Kill me.
Let's crush each other.
It hurts.
You behave like a child.
I'll show you how to do it.
We have to put it at the end of our lives.
Otherwise it will not be fun at all.
When everyone is safe, it's so boring.
In the end, we are all just pawns.
Well.
Let's play mother's daughter.
Investigator.
How many of them are here?
Isn't it worrying?
Die.
Yes, die finally, scum.
And you are really strong.
I am.
Strong.
I'm not as talented as you are.
Not so smart.
And not so strong.
The whole world.
I can't even protect the country.
All this time I kept losing.
And yet this time I will definitely do it.
I will not lose to you.
Then I will protect everyone.
And people.
And Gulia.
Damn it.
You are funny.
You build yourself a guard of justice.
You doubted yourself as the main character.
So you are a hero.
You are a hero.
You are a hero.
You are a hero.
You are a hero.
You are a hero.
You are a hero.
You are a hero.
You doubted yourself as the main character, investigator.
Don't you understand that you are the cause of this catastrophe?
You saw Tokyo, didn't you?
So what do you think?
Seeing the corpses of people killed by you.
And not just people.
When you were comfortable,
you took Gulia from life.
It was because of you that I had so much fun.
When you were defending yourself from the enemy many times stronger.
When you were trying to protect Tokafe in the 20th district.
When you were trying to protect the fake family of Sasaki Heisei.
When you were trying to protect Gulia as the one-eyed king.
You fell through all the fronts.
It was so much fun.
No matter how much effort you put in,
some things cannot be changed.
Right.
Today you will lose again.
Everything will be in vain.
Furuta.
What the hell are you doing?
Do you really think you have an advantage?
You don't stop making fun of me.
Not enough.
I destroyed your clan.
I compared the CCG with the Earth.
I destroyed the CCG with the Earth.
And I released a dragon that took many lives.
This is not enough.
Give me everything you have.
More.
More.
More.
More.
Give me everything.

You won't make this.
You definitely did not make us.
Lets go!
Let's go!
Yes!
It feels good, don't overdo it.
And in the cage, when, when will you come out, investigator?
Have you ever thought that everything is meaningless?
Life, death, create and destroy.
It's all useless, it's all pointless, it's all so stupid.
This world is like a box with toys.
Play as much as you want, but when the time comes, everything will be over.
The box is closed and it is no longer to be opened.
You yourself are pretty sorry, investigator.
You continue to grab onto this pitiful world.
You have gone all this way alone.
If you hadn't met Risa then, then you wouldn't have had to play this stupid role.
Right?
Furuta, I, I was an ordinary book lover who was full of books.
But on the day of meeting Risa, everything changed.
My life was under threat.
I was even brutally tortured.
Unable to achieve my goal, I lost.
But I found a new place in life.
I found a teacher.
I found new friends.
And I found love.
Despite all my mistakes and how much pain I caused, I don't believe it was all in vain.
You, you are your Matsuri.
Because even if I knew what was waiting for me, I would still have met Risa that day.
Everything that happened, I needed.
This world.
This world is not a mistake.
It is what it is.
Even if everything would have been in vain one day, I would continue to cling.
Just like now.
It seems that I don't understand you.
Oh, I can't die in this hole.
To hell with all this.
And this whole world is also to hell.
Hey, investigator.
Say I would like to live an ordinary life.
Would you laugh at me?
No.
My turn.
Well, wait.
Hey, Risa.
Even when we grow old, let's stay the same.
But I don't want to become a grandmother, Nimura.
What? Really?
But I'm sure it will be fun.
Yes, I'm sure.
Yes, I'm sure.
Attention, everyone.
Do not continue the fight.
Take care of the wounded.
I repeat.
Do not enter the fight.
Take care of the wounded.
Kaneki.
Yedra must be right in front of you.
Hurry up.
Kaneki.
Just don't you dare come back.
Take or lose.
Capture or be captured.
Obey or command.
Again and again.
Prove and deny.
Fight to not lose anyone.
And all the same, our beloved and our place in the world will one day disappear.
In the end, everyone will forget us.
Life is sad and painful.
Even so, knowing that the loss is not to be avoided, knowing that one day you will disappear, we continue to go to the goal.
We want to be beautiful.
And so I made the choice to continue to choose and be chosen.
And so I made the choice to continue to choose and be chosen.
Goodbye, Reiza.
Thank you.
To be continued...
To be continued...
You know, Kaneki, I've been watching you all this time.
Kaneki.
Brother.
Sasaki.
Kaneki.
Haise.
Ken.

Kaneki.
Sasan.
Maman.

Six years later.
Since then, Tokyo has changed.
All the sources of the poison have been destroyed and people have stopped becoming gulims.
By stepping forward, thanks to the cells of the children of the dragons, medicine has saved many lives.

Among the many corpses from the island of Rossima, the remains with traces of the operation were discovered.
They were identified as the body of Shirazu.

I wanted to blame myself, hide myself in my heart
But then still, I'm never afraid
I didn't think I was close enough
Because only people you knew
Did you advice me?
But like a woman, like a girl
I knew I added more to herace
It was the sameday
The sun is setting on the sea level
Your face is falling, it looks like you're smiling
Hey, isn't that right?
