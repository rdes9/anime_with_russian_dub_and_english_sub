Good morning.
Coffee.
Coffee.
Want some?
Anilibria.TV presents Tokyo Ghoul Rebirth.
Tokyo Ghoul Rebirth.
Tokyo Ghoul Rebirth.
S, A, A, S, S+, S, S, S+, S.
You've got enough to get to the special class.
Hey, stop counting the rewards.
Hey, hey, hey, what the hell did the pigeons forget here?
We're here to protect Kaneki Ken.
That's it?
This is Kishou's last wish.
They're on our side.
Maybe for you, yes?
What kind of collection is this?
So, the rest of the Oogiris and the Caffeines decided to sit down for a cup of tea and coffee?
Until my father dies, I will help you.
Kaneki Ken, your comrades saved me in Rus.
That's why I decided to listen to your pleas.
I will fulfill the will of the former one-eyed king.
I will create a world where people and ghouls will come to understand.
That's the stupidest idea.
How do you imagine the understanding between people and ghouls?
We'll talk it over.
Are you really angry?
We kill each other because no side has tried to understand the other.
People and ghouls can live in peace.
And I, as a former person, am a living example of that.
We need to talk it over.
But I doubt they will listen.
That's why we will force them to sit down at the negotiating table.
I declare the creation of an anti-human organization led by the one-eyed king.
And it will be called the Caffeine.
Episode 17.
Move.
Bullshit.
Hirakataka.
Arima took my sister's life.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I killed my sister's life.
She was the mother of Touki Ayato.
Now tell me that he was on the side of the ghouls.
Even if he was standing here now, I would also wish him death.
All his relatives worked for wear and tear.
In the hope of getting at least a little praise.
Perhaps that's why I'm here.
I wanted him to recognize me.
Always.
Arima Kisho is dead.
No matter how much hatred you have, you won't be able to kill him the second time.
As much as your sister can't be returned.
Yomo Renji.
I believe in the heir Arima Kisho.
And you believe in Kaneki Gena.
Isn't that enough?
To understand.
It doesn't mean to think the same way.
I think so.
Then...
It's possible.
Taki!
Television!
Look!
The building of CCG in the 22nd district is smoking black smoke.
The same is observed in a couple of other districts.
Are these the ghouls' work?
It wasn't us.
First, your murder.
Now this.
It looks like they're destroying the department in response to the appearance of the One-Eyed King.
That's how it works.
The other side.
She's paralyzed.
In a terrible state.
She can't come to her senses.
If it goes on like this...
Can't you do anything?
Enough!
Hands off!
Hello, Banjikyum.
How old are you?
Nika!
How did you...
If you catch someone in captivity, you should tie them tighter.
Roma sent me a small signal to the SOS.
Do you see the worms from Kaguna?
Do you need Roma?
Well, I decided with one eye to look at your king.
With one eye?
This woman is dying.
Do you want to say you can save her?
No chance.
But there is a way.
Way?
Yes, it's pretty simple.
Show it to this doctor.
Naki...
Enough, Naki!
Shut up!
He'll answer for everything!
Did you hear that?
You killed our brother, Kaneki!
I'll kill you!
You want to tell me that you won't get into the case?
Uniting with a bastard who killed a brother?
It's not our style!
Naki...
How can I win your trust?
We're in the 13th district, it's simple.
The strongest rules.
Then let's get started.
It would be disrespectful to your brother, Mizo.
The sea is far away from you.
Of course!
Don't run!
Does it hurt?
It hurts.
How did it happen, brother?
Let's continue.
As I promised, from this day on you are the leader of the white costumes.
Naki...
If you think you're destined to die,
please die for me.
I'm in the same boat as you.
The 13th district keeps its word.
A great wheel.
There are rumors that these people are helping the ghouls.
The pigs will fly faster.
It's not that incredible.
Here come your pigs.
Hello.
I'm Ogura from the Great Wheel.
Ogura, what is the Great Wheel?
We started as a simple student circle.
A student circle, you say?
Yes.
The group is made up of students from Kami University
and is forced to be reformed because of the pressure.
We changed the structure and composition.
Nevertheless, our principle remained unchanged.
What principle?
We were just born to be people.
There have always been victims and hunters in the world,
and in such a world, everything is solved at the time of birth.
Therefore, we only have to fight.
But if we set aside the standards,
both sides would be able to understand each other.
This is our point of view.
This theory was promoted by a student from Kami University,
who was interested in providing medical education.
I was told that her lover was a ghoul.
We will continue to secretly conduct our activities,
hoping that ghouls will be able to enter our society.
We support the goat and the one-eyed king.
Nisho, the founder of the Great Wheel?
I guess I'll go get some coffee.
Where am I?
You woke up!
Who are you?
That's what happened while I was dreaming.
Akira.
I'm sorry. You couldn't have left me.
Can we talk?
Yes.
It's so strange.
Once we tried to take each other's lives,
and now we're standing shoulder to shoulder.
I never thought that you wanted to take my life.
It was a shock to me.
I've never seen a ghoul who would let the investigator go.
The eye-catching power of the ghouls
For this world, everything looks simple.
The ghouls are just devouring the monsters,
no more, no less.
I'm not going to change my mind.
I'm going to fight for the ghouls.
That's all.
Why does the former man treat the ghouls so warmly?
Because we look alike.
The ghouls are isolated from us.
Just like me.
There are people who are dear to me personally.
But if you take humanity, I don't care.
I fight not for those I don't see,
but for those who are next to me.
And it just so happened that most of them are ghouls.
I understand your weak motivation.
I understand your weak motivation.
I understand your weak motivation.
I see.
And yet I understand you.
What are you going to do now, Aman?
I don't know.
But since then, my feelings haven't changed.
I'll do what I think is right.
Akira has come to consciousness.
Don't you want to see her?
A tie.
If a friend or a friend you thought was dead
suddenly appears before you,
what will you feel?
I...
probably fear.
Fear?
That they might leave again.
Right.
You're right.
You're right.
We haven't seen each other for a long time.
Maristello?
It's been a long time.
How did you get into my house?
Through the window.
I see.
Did you break in?
You call me Senior Investigator.
Although we are now ex-investigators.
Akira, first of all,
let me apologize for not being able to tell you anything.
Thank you for bringing Maristello.
For the last few years, I've been thinking about your death.
What should I tell you?
I don't need your apologies.
I'm unhappy and upset.
I'm confused.
I'm sorry, Senior Investigator Aman.
No, it's all right.
I'm going to stay here.
If you need anything, just ask.
I'll be waiting.
He's not lying, Iteinai.
He's not lying.
But I don't think he can tell me the truth.
How should I look him in the eye?
Have you recovered?
Is there a minute?
Madu Akira.
Let's get down to business.
The one who killed your father.
It was me.
So why did you have to tell the patient?
I'm glad you're so nasty.
So I can hate you openly.
All right, I'm glad to hear it.
What the hell?
Children.
They are Guli.
Those who were adopted by Aogiri.
Children who lost their parents and grew up alone.
Sister.
Hinami.
You're here.
I wanted to see the kids.
I see.
Sister Hinami.
Sister, hurry up.
I'm coming.
Hinami.
Hinami.
Hinami.
Hinami.
Hinami was the last Guli your father hunted.
She's the same as these kids.
She lost her parents and lost her family.
Lost?
Stop walking around.
Just tell me, rabbit.
My father killed them?
Right.
Why are you showing me this?
Do you want to feel sorry?
I don't need your sympathy.
Actually, I feel sorry for you.
Me?
Our father was always nice to us.
Always kind and smiling.
But...
Behind our backs...
He killed a bunch of people.
Not for food.
For revenge for mom.
And I...
I thought he was an idiot.
I thought he was a useless parent.
Who died for such a stupid reason.
And I thought I was useless.
We couldn't save our father.
Because it was our father who was sicker after mom's death than us.
I...
I don't support anyone who's wrong.
Even my father.
But I wanted to be with him.
Sister!
Are you okay?
I'm fine, I'm fine.
Let's go down.
Let's go.
Wait!
Let me tell you something.
As much as I know about Hinamiri,
she never hurt your father.
It's true.
Come on, honey.
Grab her!
Sister!
You smell like coffee.
Hey, baby.
Can you hug this lady?
Of course.
Can I?
Do whatever you want.
It smells good.
I'm hungry.
Hinami.
Hinami.
Hinami.
Hinami.
Hinami.
Hinami.
Hinami.
Hinami.
Hinami.
Hinami.
Hinami.
Hinami.
Hinami.
Hinami.
Hinami.
It's so warm.
Who did I hate back then?
And who do I hate now?
