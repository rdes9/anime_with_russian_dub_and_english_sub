Thank you very much, Mutsuki.
The guy that I put you in charge of
was created to help Kaneki turn into this.
I thank you for such an accurate investigation of my plan.
Love is so beautiful.
Well, what is it like to personally turn your beloved Sensei into a human?
Who is this? Who is this?
She looks like a monster.

Sheep
Hey Look.
Urgent news. The monster in the city continues to demolish the building
and harm the residents. Kagome will be威果
Episode 21. Dissolution. Morse code.
I'm surprised you found me.
I hoped that my visit would be unnoticed.
Furuta knows what he's doing.
Soon the light will be shed on the information about the ghouls that were hiding in Ashura.
The research will finally progress.
People will understand their value in medicine.
It happened a little earlier.
The grave of the Semikana.
As if I'll accept it.
You'll smooth the wine with death.
I'm not going to smooth the wine.
After all, I don't regret anything.
I envy you.
I'm too strong for hatred.
Kurona.
Forgive me.
So that's what death is.
How interesting.
We found Kano.
And his body.
It turns out we were left without an informant.
Kano's death will be our insurance.
And what does it mean?
I don't know.
Ask Nagachiko.
Nishino.
Kano Akihiro's assistant.
Nishino.
Okay, it works.
You say?
Yes.
Thanks to Dr. Uchigyo.
Why are you dressed so strangely?
I tried to put on some clothes.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I tried to find those who wanted to save Koneki.
And I'm doing my job better.
This wouldn't have ended.
So now I'm not afraid.
But for this, something must happen.
And that's why you called us here?
Yes.
I think I understand what you're talking about.
Oh my God.
My father will definitely send me to heaven.
As always, strange language.
Nagachiko.
Why are you trying so hard for Kano Kiken?
Why?
Well...
I like this guy.
Do you need another reason?
No.
Let's go.
So the baby will freeze.
I hope the rain will stop soon.
Amen.
Touka!
Vitorio.
What a beautiful woman you have become.
What are the ducks and the others busy with?
Everything is as usual.
They behave like real clowns.
And what are you poor sheep going to do?
I think I'm not ashamed to run away now.
But...
I see you doubt.
Then maybe you'll watch it to the end?
Watch it?
Well, Koneki became like this because he wanted to protect you.
A bunch of people died.
Don't listen.
No.
He killed them.
Crushed them.
No matter bad or good.
People who looked down from above.
He did it for you.
The king did it for us?
He killed people.
The pigeons killed my family.
And my child.
It's a revenge.
For us.
It's all for us.
Yes.
We will watch it to the end.
The king.
The king.
The king.
The king.
Shut up!
He always thought about others.
And about people.
And about hooligans.
It's so funny.
Watch it to the end.
That's what you want.
I'm not the only one.
I wanted to see him happy.
He can't read his favorite book.
He can't drink hot coffee.
He can't talk to his friends.
He can't hug his beloved.
And even his own child.
I still have so much to do with Kaneki.
I have to watch him.
And if I'm lucky, even bite.
And parents and children.
Hey.
But I clearly have something to tell him.
He would rely on us more.
Kirishima.
I want to thank my brother.
He still has to come up with a name.
I'm not good at that.
Kirishima!
I've already come up with a couple.
You can rely on me.
No.
So what are you planning to do?
Oh, hi Touka.
You...
When it wakes up again,
it will start a fire to restore energy.
And what to do?
The main body should be somewhere inside.
If we take it out,
then how will it start to decay?
But it doesn't matter what to look for a needle in a haystack.
And we don't have another way out?
Wait for natural decay.
And how long to wait?
About...
200 years.
Looks like we'll have to look for it.
Mr. Maruda!
Huh?
What the hell is going on here?
Nogachika?
This is Akira and Aman Kotaro's fashion.
What are you doing?
I brought support.
We need to dig it out.
But people have their limits.
We need mobility.
Mobility?
And you think we're going to work with ghouls?
Yes.
What?
Inside this thing is Kaneki Ken.
It's obvious that these guys want to help.
Kaneki Ken?
A one-eyed king?
It's a miracle.
What's going on?
Aman!
Maybe someone will explain?
Director!
Where is he going at such moments?
The director resigned.
His goal was to create this thing.
We were all surrounded by fingers.
Hey, you.
Do you think the investigators should be friends with ghouls?
And now look at their faces.
I don't think I need to explain.
Go away until we kill you all.
Inspector Lui.
What is the most important thing in an investigator's job?
Killing ghouls.
Incorrect.
Fighting for peace.
That's the most important thing.
We have to fight.
Even with ghouls.
I agree.
As an investigator, I will fight with ghouls.
What do you want?
To work with ghouls?
They are our enemies.
What about our pride, C.G.?
Pride?
You can rub yourself on her.
Well, well.
What a show.
Shouzuya.
You decide.
Well, let's get to work.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's work together.
It will be easier.
That's how it should be.
Are you happy now?
C.G. accepts your offer.
There must be a way to find the body.
If there was a way to find it somehow.
Hi.
What a beauty.
Free?
I've been looking for you all this time.
So what did you do to Laucan?
I needed knowledge.
And what did you want to do with them?
I wanted to make my dream come true.
So that I, as a human,
could be a ghoul with you without any objections.
Kimi.
I wonder if he's sleeping there now.
So, when did you fall in love with him?
Oh, come on.
When I attacked the pigeons.
He said it would be sad if you died.
I think at that moment.
Wow, that's what he said.
What a wimp.
I thought he would save me like that.
But will we save him?
We'll try.
So how did the wedding go?
Is it important?
What? Come on.
And the honeymoon?
Did he give you a ring?
Well, yes.
About the ring.
I gave him...
A ring.
A ring?
Yes.
I gave him exactly the same thing.
A metal detector.
Exactly.
The metal detector will not react to living flesh.
So we will definitely find Kaneki.
But this Kaguna is so huge.
All metal detectors will not be enough.
Hello, Shu?
What is it?
Yes, of course.
Hello, Prime Minister?
Did you manage to get them in such a short time?
But how?
I asked the Prime Minister.
It's better not to know the rest.
Please forgive me.
Thank you.
We are all Japanese.
It's moving again.
Sir, we need to step back with the wheel.
Let them continue.
If this thing wakes up completely,
then its size can become several times larger.
I will make it bigger.
I will make it bigger.
I will make it bigger.
I will make it bigger.
I will make it bigger.
I will make it bigger.
I will make it bigger.
I will make it bigger.
I will make it bigger.
Mr. Maruda.
What?
This monster.
Mabuchi, what is the number?
About 100 to 1.
That's it.
Then we can handle it.
All units!
Hold on to the plan.
The investigators will deal with the toothless bastards.
This is our only chance.
Guli and the Quinks continue their search.
Mutsuki!
Mochaka!
Stop, Mutsuki!
Enough, Mochaka!
You shouldn't fight them!
I'm not afraid of her!
It's all my fault.
Sensei became like this because of me.
Enough, Mutsuki!
Enough, Mutsuki!
Enough, Mutsuki!
Mochi.
All the other captains were worried about you all this time.
But I can't understand.
Mochi, what are you trying to achieve?
What do you want from us?
Mochi.
Enough, Mutsuki!
He knew from the beginning that I was a girl.
But his lie was so kind.
He lied not to protect himself like I did.
He lied to protect others.
And yet I turned him into this.
If you want me to stop, kill me!
I refuse.
I'm not going to change.
What choice do I have?
Mochi.
If this is your choice, why do you have so much pain in your eyes?
I...
I'd rather die.
When Torsu kidnapped me.
Or during the operation.
Or when I first took the knife.
All this time I was supported by our life in the mansion.
And it doesn't matter if he doesn't look at me.
I'm just...
But...
It doesn't matter anymore.
I don't want to hurt you anymore.
And I don't want to lie to myself anymore.
I can't do it anymore.
I have to die.
I'm sorry.
You're going to die?
Are you serious?
Saiko...
Saiko...
She loves you!
You're such a fool!
You're a fool!
Not only are you not afraid of her.
I...
I think so too.
And Shirazu too.
We want you to live.
If you're going to die...
We will stop you every time.
You still have things to do.
We need your help, Mutsuki.
Ure...
Mutsuki!
Saiko...
Saiko...
See?
What do you think?
Did I do something right?
Commander Shirazu.
The End
The End
The End
Where are you going?
I see.
The End
