        <pre>He has already started to dream sweet dreams.
They will not wake up again.
There is no way back, even for a strong hunter.
The human desire comes from the heart, from the soul.
You just need to destroy their core of the soul,
and then they will become living corpses.
The human hearts are the same.
They are all so fragile, as if made of glass.
Slowly, slowly immerse yourself in the dream.
In an endless dream, from which they will never wake up.
Locked up in the red, where will the car go?
On the night when the golden night is blown away,
our voices resounded.
Lighting the light of the wish,
the heart throws away the dream
and goes down the white road.
In the dark sky, the star of dawn
does not move at all,
so we wave our hands to yesterday,
so that we can run again.
Even if we get lost, even if we lament,
we will wave our hands to the bright future.
Lighting the light of the wish,
so that at least the singing voice reaches you.
Episode 3
As it should be.
Where are you going?
Come here!
These are very tasty peaches!
And there's a lot of white clover here!
I'll make a wine for you!
They work great for me!
Nezuko!
Uh-huh!
Make them bigger!
Zenitsu!
Hurray!
There's a river on the way, but don't worry, it's not deep!
River?
Um, Zenitsu...
I don't know how to swim.
Get on my back, I'll carry you!
Lay down on me!
You won't even get your toes wet!
Leave all this to me!
Let's go!
Episode 4
Cavemen! Cavemen!
We're proud cavemen!
We're exploring caves!
We're walking through caves!
Boss!
Boss!
Report!
Minion 1, Minion 2!
I can smell the owner of this cave!
There he is!
I can hear his snoring!
He's here!
Okay, let's go!
Yes, boss!
What are you doing?
Let's go, Minion 3!
Come here!
I'll give you shiny stomachs!
Let's go!
Hurray!
Hurray!
Why am I here?
To tell my father that I've finally become a Hasher.
Why?
So what if you've become a Hasher?
What difference does it make if you or I don't become great people?
Brother, father was happy for you when I became a Hasher.
Father was happy for you when I became a Hasher.
Father will recognize me.
He wasn't like that before.
Once he was a Hasher of demon hunters.
He was full of passion.
But one day he suddenly let go of his hands.
Unexpectedly.
The one who raised and taught us with such care.
Why?
Don't worry about what I can't change.
Asenjuro got even more.
He almost doesn't remember the mother who got sick and died when he was a child.
And now father is in such a state.
To be honest, father wasn't happy about it.
He said he didn't care.
However, it won't weaken my enthusiasm.
The flame in my heart will never go out.
I will never despair.
Asenjuro, my brother.
You're not like me.
You have an elder brother.
And he believes in his younger brother.
No matter what path you choose, you will become a great man.
Let the passion be in your heart.
Work hard, don't give up.
Try your best.
Even if you're lonely.
Oh, what a wonderful feeling.
The ropes that I tied allow me to fall into the sleep of a man to whom they are tied.
I've always been very careful with my enemies.
While they sleep, even if it's hushers, they will be like children.
I just need to wait for delicious food when they deal with the hunters.
You don't have to swing your sword like that.
Try to relax your shoulders.
Like this?
Yes.
I see.
That's the real essence.
It's good if they don't notice me.
Hurry up to the sleep border.
Hurry up.
Snig, are you crazy?
Hurry up.
The dreams that I create are not limitless.
They are a circle with a sleeping person in the center.
There is an unconscious zone beyond the border of dreams.
The core of the soul is in it.
You need to destroy the core.
If you destroy it, the owner will become an empty shell.
I can't go any further.
Here it is.
The road continues, but I can't go any further.
I need to hurry up and destroy its core.
And then I'll dive into a sweet dream too.
What a strange unconscious zone.
It's hot here, and the air is burning.
I need to hurry up.
I found it!
I found it!
The core of the soul!
I've never seen a red one.
But the core is fragile,
like glass!
When people fall under the influence of the demon's technique,
they can't move.
It's an incredible survival instinct.
Tanjirah, today Mom will cook your favorite dish.
Wait, I'll finish the rest of the mochi.
It worked out quickly! Mom will bake senbei!
That's not fair! I love senbei too, Mom!
I want senbei too!
Okay, let's eat together.
Will you help Mom with the cooking?
Yes!
I'll mix the mochi in a bowl.
I want to help too!
Me too!
Then the brother will have to eat everything.
That's not fair!
The blade that cuts through demons.
The endless train.
Let's go, Nezuko.
What am I saying?
I'm home!
Welcome home, Tanjirah.
I'm home.
Welcome home, Nezuko.
I'm home.
Welcome home, brothers!
Hi, Tanjirah!
Hi!
Where's Nezuko?
She went to the mountain to pick wild vegetables.
In the middle of the day?
Is it bad?
What?
Tanjirah, can you prepare water for the bath?
There's still a lot of work to do in the kitchen.
I'm still saying some strange things.
Maybe I'm just tired?
It's strange. He's gone.
What was that?
It's a tool box.
Maybe I saw something.
Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up! They attacked you!
It's a dream! It's just a dream!
You have to wake up!
That's right! That's right! I...
I have to be on the train!
Wake up and fight! Fight!
Wake up and fight!
Brother, will you give me a cucumber?
No!
Enough of you!
You always do this! You take food from your brother!
So what?
You already got your food!
I'm not awake. I'm still sleeping.
I'm still sleeping.
How can I wake up?
I just realized it's a dream.
What should I do?
I have to wake up!
Brother! What should I do?
He's burning!
Brother!
It's Nezuko's smell!
It's her blood!
Nezuko!
Nezuko!
It's her blood!
It's her blood!
It's her blood!
It's her blood!
It's her blood!
Nezuko!
The hunter's form and the Necherin's blade are in a dream!
I think...
I'll take a break.
I'm starting to wake up.
Brother, are you okay?
Brother, are you okay?
I'm sorry, but I have to go.
I have to go back right now.
I'm sorry.
Brother!
Brother!
Brother!
If this demon is close to the dream,
we have to find and kill it!
We have to find it!
Hurry!
Hurry!
Hurry!
We have to find it!
Hurry!
Tanjirou!
Where are you going?
I collected a lot of wild vegetables on the mountain.
Mom!
Come here!
Brother suddenly caught on fire!
Mom?
Tanjirou, are you okay?
Brother...
What's wrong, Tanjirou?
Why are you dressed like that?
How do I want to stay here forever?
Turn around and go back.
If only I could always live here with you.
On this mountain.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
If only you were alive and well.
If only Nezuko could walk under the blue sky.
When the sun shines.
And I would continue to make coal.
And I would never touch the ball.
That's right.
That's how it was supposed to be.
But I've already lost it all.
And I can't get my loved ones back.
Dad!
Don't leave us!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Rokuto.
I can't stay with you anymore.
But nevertheless, your older brother always thinks about you.
He thinks about all of you.
I'm so grateful to you.
And I'm very sorry.
I will never forget you.
You will stay in my heart forever.
So please, I beg you, forgive me.
Hurry.
We need to destroy his soul core.
His core is right here.
It's so beautiful here.
It's so spacious.
It's so warm here.
It's been a while.
They've had problems.
They still haven't destroyed a single core.
Oh well.
It's okay.
They win time for me.
I don't see it.
There's still a smell.
But there's no demon.
But why?
It's like there's some kind of a spell here.
I can smell the demon everywhere.
But I can't figure out where it is.
We need to hurry.
The smell is bleeding.
If the others are asleep too,
it's going to be bad.
What should I do?
I'm not using all my concentration.
Am I just sleeping right now?
Tanjiru!
Take out your sword.
There is what you have to cut.
There is what you can cut.
What I have to cut to wake up.
I think I know what it is.
But what if I'm wrong?
If the action in the dream affects reality,
then there will be no way back.
Stop doubting. Just do it!
Do it!
The death in the dream leads to awakening in reality.
And that means...
What I have to cut...
My own neck!
To be continued...
To be continued...
To be continued...
To be continued...
You did a good job, son.
You always told me, dad.
Even when it's hard,
don't lose your love for the people around you.
Be strong, but kind.
Everyone who fell into this trap of the demon
and your sister Ezuka,
their fate is in your hands.
Dad, I won't let you down.
