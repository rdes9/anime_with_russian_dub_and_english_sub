        <pre>The third style is the burning soul.
The fourth style is the lightning of the burning fire.
Destruction of the goal.
The fifth style is the flaming tiger.
The fighting style.
Yagura!
Yagura!
He did it! He defeated him!
The blade that cuts the demons.
The endless train.
Episode seven.
Burn with your heart.
Don't die, Kyojuro.
Rengoku!
Rengoku!
Rengoku!
It doesn't matter how desperately you fight.
It's all useless, Kyojuro.
No matter how deep this wonderful fighter was,
it's useless.
No matter how deep this wonderful fighter was,
he has already completely healed it.
But what about you?
Your left eye is broken, your ribs are broken.
You are bleeding.
This is a serious wound.
If you were a demon, you would be instantly healed.
For a demon, this is just a scratch.
No matter how much they suffer, people cannot defeat demons.
I really want to help him.
But I can't even breathe.
It's probably because I'm wounded.
I feel bad even after using the dance.
Kyojuro, you...
I...
I will fulfill my duty.
And I will not let anyone die here.
I will strike with a large area of defeat.
The breath of flame.
The purifier.
What a wonderful fighting spirit!
You have so many wounds, but such a power of the spirit!
What a decisiveness!
Your stance is perfect!
You really deserve to become a demon, Kyojuro!
Then you will be able to fight with me forever!
Roar from your heart!
Overcome yourself!
I am the fire of fire!
Renkoku Kyojuro!
You are strong!
Renkoku!
Destruction of the goal!
Destroying style!
Renkoku!
Renkoku!
Renkoku!
Renkoku!
I see...
Ren...
...koku...
Die!
You're finished, Kyojuro!
Surrender!
Say you will become a demon!
You...
...are one of the chosen ones!
Kyojuro.
Yes, mother!
Think about it.
What did I ask you?
Do you know why you are stronger than other people since birth?
I don't know!
Because you can protect the weak.
Those people who are given more abilities than others...
...should use this power in the name of good.
It is unforgivable to use the power...
...given by the heavens...
...to harm people and taint yourself.
To protect and help the weak...
...is the duty of those born strong.
Be responsible for this...
...and fulfill your duty.
Never...
...forget about it.
Understood!
I will not give up.
I will not give up.
I will not give up.
I will not give up.
I will not give up.
I am happy that I was the mother of such a strong and kind child.
I'm ready!
Mother!
Mother!
Mother!
Mother!
Mother!
Mother!
Mother!
Mother!
Mother!
Mother!
Mother!

Mother!
Mother!
Mother!
Mother!
You have stopped!
Incredible power!
Incredible power!
But my fist pierced his belly!
Damn it! It's almost dawn!
I need to kill him faster!
I can't pull out my hand!
I won't let you get away!
Damn it!
Whatever it takes, I have to help him somehow!
I have to! I have to do this!
I have to hurry! I have to cut the demon's neck!
Right now!
It's almost dawn!
The sun will light this place!
I have to get out of here!
I won't let you get away!
Until I cut your head off!
Get away from me!
I won't let you get away!
Yanozki, help me!
Get out of my way for Rengoku!
The beast's breath!
The first blow!
Stab him!
I have to hurry! There's a shadow somewhere!
This is bad!
I have to run away from the sun!
I have to run away from the sun!
Where are you going?
Where are you going, you bastard?
Don't run away!
What is this kid talking about?
He's got a head on his shoulders!
I'm not running away from the demon hunters!
I'm running away from the damn sun!
Besides, this battle is over!
Soon he'll lose his power and he'll die!
The demon hunters will fight you in the dark night!
You have the advantage!
We consist of flesh and blood!
The wounds don't heal!
And the lungs won't grow back!
Why are you running away, you bastard?
You're a fool!
You're afraid to admit it!
Rengoku is stronger!
Much stronger than you!
You're a fool!
You're a fool!
He's stronger than you!
He's stronger!
Rengoku didn't lose!
He protected us!
He didn't lose!
And he didn't let anyone die!
You lost!
The victory is yours!
For Rengoku!
Don't cry, my boy!
I know, it hurts you too.
The wound in your stomach can open.
Come on, my boy, if you die,
I won't be able to call it a victory.
Rengoku!
Come to me.
Let's talk a little bit in the end.
The blade that cuts demons apart.
The endless train.
I remember what I saw.
I remember what I saw.
I remember what I saw.
In a dream about my past.
I think you should visit my home.
There you will find old records
about the former Hashira Flame.
My father often reads them.
But I haven't read them personally,
so I have no idea what's there.
There must be something about
the dance of the fire god
that you were talking about.
Please, Rengoku, enough!
Tell me how to stop the bleeding!
You can't use your breath!
No, I'm going to die very soon.
But I have something to tell you,
Rengoku.
I want you to tell my younger brother, Senjuro,
that he should follow the path
that he thinks is right.
Follow the call of the heart.
And tell my father
that he should take care of himself.
And Kamado,
my boy,
I believe in your younger sister.
And I recognize her as a demon hunter.
I saw how she
shed her blood in this train
to protect people.
If she risks her life
to protect people,
no matter what people say,
your sister is a member of the squad.
So, my boy,
no matter how weak you feel,
and no matter how painful it is,
you should keep your heart afloat.
Clench your teeth and move on!
If you get stuck in a corner and cry,
your time will only pass.
It won't stop,
even if you're sad.
Do not regret my death, my boy.
After all, I am a Hasher,
and my job is to protect the younger generation.
Any Hasher
would do the same.
The younger generation is not allowed to lose.
Kamado, my boy,
boar head,
blondie,
keep training and growing.
And one day
you will become a Hasher
and support the demon hunter squad.
That's what I believe in.
I believe in you and in everyone else.
Mother.
I did a good job, Mother.
I did everything I had to do.
I used my gift right.
You did a great job.
THE END
When the train got off the rails,
Rengoku used several machines
to minimize the damage to the wagons.
I know what he did.
How can such a man die?
Was it really the Demon of the High Moon?
Yes.
But why did he come here?
Was he so strong?
Yes.
It's all so sad.
Every time I learn something new,
I realize how much I don't know yet.
These guys are fighting
using all their strength and abilities.
And I'm following them.
Am I capable of something like that?
Will I be able to become as strong as Rengoku?
Don't think too much about it!
Whether you can do it or not,
the water doesn't flow under the stone.
He said he believes in us.
Don't worry about anything and go on with your life.
Everything that dies comes back to Earth.
You won't bring anyone back with your tears.
It doesn't matter how sad you are.
It doesn't matter how sorry you are and how humiliated you are.
You have to keep living.
But you're crying too.
Tears flow from under your mask.
I'm not crying!
Come on, we have to practice!
Come on!
Here it is, Rengoku.
So even Rengoku lost to the Demon High Moon.
I can't believe it.
Amitabha Amit!
I will wipe out all the demons from the face of Earth!
So that's how it is.
So none of the passengers died on this mission?
Kyojuro bravely fought.
He was an amazing young man.
And he won't be alone.
After all, I have very little left.
Very soon I will go to another world,
where I am waiting for Kyojuro and peace.
Rengoku!
Rengoku!
