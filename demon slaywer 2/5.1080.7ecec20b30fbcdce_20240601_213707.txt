I won't let you betray my family!
This demon is weaker than him.
Now I understand why the Lord ordered me to kill you.
Vestiskasher!
Your existence makes me tremble with anger!
He's not dying!
Do you want to know why I didn't die?
You didn't die, although you cut off my head.
But you're not my real body anymore.
While you were sleeping tight, I fell asleep with this train.
The whole train became my blood, my flesh, my bones.
Will you be able to protect all the people who filled this train?
Will you be able to slow me down?
What should I do? What should I do?
I can protect passengers only in two wagons.
But I can't do it anymore.
Rengoku! Zenitsu! Inosuke!
It's not time to sleep! Please wake up!
Nezuko! You have to protect the sleeping people!
Follow me, my minions!
Explosive awakening!
I'll attack you with a break!
Attack in the path of Inosuke!
Inosuke!
Inosuke!
Episode 5
Inosuke!
It's not safe on this train!
We need to protect the sleeping people!
The whole train is a demon!
Did you hear? The whole train is a demon!
Inosuke!
Inosuke!
Inosuke!
Inosuke!
Inosuke!
Inosuke!
Did you hear? The whole train is a demon!
I knew it!
Everything as I expected!
It means that I was right!
And I'm the boss here!
Beast's Breath!
The fifth cry!
Madness!
Madness!
I'm going to save each of them!
And you kneel before me!
Praise me!
Mr. Inosuke is going forward!
We need to save these passengers too.
I think Inosuke will make it here.
And I'll go forward!
Inosuke!
How?
So fast?
It's too fast!
Water breathing!
First style!
Water Slash!
It's not very effective.
The body of the demon seems to be endless.
How do I stop it?
Damn hunters.
Everything is inside me.
I recover instantly.
I will not stop until you lose your strength.
And when it happens, I will eat all the passengers.

...
Blaff...
I don't know what's going on there.
Zenitsu has already woken up.
What about Rengoku?
What about Nezuko?
I can only protect those who are close to me.
It's bad what to do.
We can't unite.
I will hope that the neighboring car is safe.
I will wait.
I will wait.
I will hope that the neighboring car is safe.
Damn, it's too tight here.
You won't get away with anything here.
So that's what happened while I was dreaming.
Definitely, definitely.
That's the kind of harsher I am.
I want to be ashamed.
Burn!
What?
What was that just now?
A demon attack?
Kamado, my boy!
Rengoku!
Before I came here, I hit the demon several times.
Regeneration will take some time.
We don't have enough of him, so I will speak quickly.
Yes!
The train consists of eight wagons.
I will protect the five rear ones.
The other three will protect the guy in yellow and your sister.
You and the boar head,
protect them and go to the neck of the demon.
Neck?
But the demon...
It doesn't matter what he looks like.
Every demon has a neck.
I'm going to look for weak spots too.
It's time to show you my spirit, my boy.
Wow!
He's so strong!
That means Rengoku shook the train.
He appreciated the situation so quickly.
Protecting five wagons alone...
It's not the time to admire them, fool!
Do what you have to do.
The smell is getting stronger and stronger.
We have to hurry.
Inosuke!
Where are you, Inosuke?
Shut up, or I'll kill you!
Upstairs.
You dared to point your eyes at me?
And still...
And still...
He's so cool!
And it's really pissing me off!
Inosuke!
Check the first three wagons.
I know!
By the way, I've been looking for them for a long time.
I had to go all out.
But I found a weak spot in the ladder.
Really?
That means it's ahead.
Yes, it's ahead.
But there's definitely something wrong here.
Because of the wind, I can't determine the smell source.
So in that case, it's better to listen to Inosuke.
Is he next to the coal warehouse?
Yes!
I got it.
Okay, let's go.
Go!
The End
Ren Goku protects as many as five wagons.
And Inosuke found a weak spot for the demon.
Zenitsu and Nezuko are also fighting.
Therefore, I must also cope!
I have to protect everyone!
Here?
Great!
Inosuke!
Suspicious, suspicious!
They look suspicious!
Who are you?
Get out of here!
Demon's neck!
Demon's weak spot!
Horrible!
Damn! So many!
So many hands!
Water breathing!
Sixth power!
Damn!
Inosuke, are you all right?
I could handle it myself!
I understand!
So this is it!
Right under us!
Demon's smell!
It's especially strong here!
Inosuke!
Demon's neck is right under us!
Don't point it at me! I'm the boss here!
All right!
Watch and learn!
Demon's breath!
Second click!
Blow it up!
These are bones!
Neck and spine!
Water breathing!
Eighth style!
Waterfall flow!
Blocked!
The wound is healed!
It regenerates quickly!
And yet...
My strength is enough to skin the bone!
And we need to cut it!
Inosuke!
Let's combine our breath and attack together!
One will cut the flesh!
And the other will cut the bones!
Got it!
Good idea!
Worth the praise!
Thank you!
Let's go!
The eyes of forced sleep...
The art of blood!
We're trapped!
So let's go to sleep!
Inosuke!
Cut your throat in your sleep!
So you'll wake up!
It's all right!
I can resist it!
Inosuke!
I can resist it!
Inosuke!
I can resist it!
I can resist it!
Inosuke!
Close your eyes after you wake up!
Otherwise you'll fall asleep again!
All right, I woke up!
As soon as I wake up,
I catch the eyes of the demon!
Wake up with your eyes closed!
With your eyes closed!
It's useless!
I can't!
Wake up!
Hurry!
Cut your throat!
Cut it!
I need to wake up!
Hurry!
Wake up!
It's not a dream, it's reality!
You can't see it!
Don't you dare die like that!
I'm the head of the mountain lord!
That's why I'm too scary for him!
You're a beast!
Exactly!
In this case, it's hard to understand
what Inosuke is looking at!
Whatever!
Let's cut his head off!
Don't let me fall asleep!
Did he hurt you?
I'm fine!
Why are you fighting this bastard?
We won't let him die!
We have to cut the demon's neck!
Otherwise the rest won't make it!
I agree!
Inosuke!
Let's synchronize our breathing!
Let's cut the demon's neck together!
We have to attack!
Inosuke!
Inosuke!

I am the fourth wolf of the beast!
Cut it into pieces!

Let me cut his neck!

Thank God!
Your cute chin looked like a butt!
I almost forgot about the preview!
Next, episode 6!

The duty is...
