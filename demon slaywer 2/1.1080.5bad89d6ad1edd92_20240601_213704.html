happened.
Now you can think it over.
Or you can try feeling yourself different because it's helped by the emotions.
And you can feel yourself different because it's helped by that emotion.
toughest.
guilty
oh
It's all right. Please, have a seat.
Mister, bring him the same thing as me.
Are you sure you can do that?
Of course I can. I'll order an extra one too.
You're going with great pleasure.
Wait a minute.
Hoshiraplameni, you did a great job last night.
No. In the end, the demon ran away.
How do you feel wounded?
According to the doctor, there won't be any scars left from the wound.
I see. It's good that the help arrived on time.
Yes. It's thanks to your heroism.
Thank you for the food.
What is it?
This is on my account.
Thank you.
Wow, it's delicious.
Mister, I'm sure you'll be rich if you open the Wayne store.
You know a lot.
Mister, how are things going?
What do you think?
Excuse me.
Since many people here have heard about this killer,
people have stopped going out at night.
I even had to disperse the workers.
They say that the conductors were killed in the train the other day.
Besides, did you hear that the endless train was taken out of operation?
They say that about 40 passengers disappeared without a trace.
Oh, that sounds evil.
Hoshiraplameni, why did I come to you?
We found the endless train.
We were told that it was secretly transported to a certain depot.
Really?
Delicious!
Are we going to the endless train?
That's right.
But first, let's examine the station where the body of the conductor was found.
Fuku, stop sighing and eat your bun already.
There aren't that many visitors today.
I say this every day, but it's dangerous to be out at night.
Tomorrow you can start helping me during the day,
since demons appear at night.
It's all clear!
It's all clear!
I've examined everything, but I haven't found anything suspicious.
Okay.
There are no demons here.
It's about demons again.
Maybe that's enough.
I need to sell as much as possible to Bento.
Mom is already pregnant.
Her father is in the store, and things are going very badly.
Let the adults worry about it.
I'll take care of it myself in the morning and at night.
And what are you going to do if the killer attacks you?
I'm ready to sacrifice my life for you.
Grandma!
Good evening!
Is the moon beautiful today?
I'm looking for a demon right now.
Have you seen anything like this before?
What?
That's so straight!
Mr. Kajiro!
You're too straightforward!
Madam, do you know anything?
What?
A demon?
What are you talking about?
You're in your own mind!
Stay away from us!
Be careful!
If you're going to tremble like that,
you're going to drop this beautiful bun!
Stay away from me!
Tasty!
I don't believe in demons!
They don't exist, and you know that very well!
That's enough, Fuku.
I don't think this man is a bad person.
I'm sorry.
I haven't been myself lately because of the incident with the killer.
If I understand everything correctly,
then you start working while it's still dark,
and then you come here to sell Bento.
I'm very grateful to you.
No one and never should hurt people like you.
But now you can live in peace.
I'll take care of the killer.
Who are you?
Good luck!
Excuse me!
If you don't mind,
can you buy Bento?
That's a good idea!
Great!
I'll buy them all!
I'm sorry, Hoshiro Flamingo.
Good hotel for other members of the squad.
Then I'll go alone.
Thank you for your work.
Goodbye.
What was he talking about?
I'm glad he bought all the Bento, but...
Let's go home, Fuku.
I have a bad feeling.
I have goosebumps all over my back.
Grandma!
Who are you?
As you can see, I'm a Bento merchant.
There's nothing suspicious about it.
Well, you see,
this train is heading to the depot.
It's going to the depot.
It's going to the depot.
It's going to the depot.
It's going to the depot.
It's going to the depot.
The train is heading to the depot.
I know that.
I heard there's an endless train there.
I need it.
Endless train?
If you're looking for it, it's not in the depot anymore.
Really?
This morning it was sent to the technical service.
Over there.
Great! Then I'll go here.
What?
What is it?
Hey!
Sounded by Manilibria.TV
Thank you for choosing us.
Endless train.
Now everything is clear.
It's hard, but I can smell the demon.
Endless.
Hey, man!
You can't come here by strangers.
Greetings!
I brought this bento on behalf of the railway management.
Hey!
He says he brought us bento!
Hey!
Write to Tatsu.
He's resting in the office.
Yes, sir!
Why did you bring the endless train here?
It's definitely not because of the breakdown.
There are rumors that this train eats people.
You can't imagine how painful it is to hear.
But now it will be put into operation again.
We're trying to put it in order and make the world look better.
Put into operation?
Yes, tomorrow night.
That's why we're all here.
Demon!
Here, demon!
Tatsu!
Everyone back!
Boss!
Bastard!
Let go of the guy!
A demon hunter!
How arrogant!
Ugh!
What kind of war is this?
Since I became a demon,
I can't stand the human race.
I can't stand the human race.
I can't stand the human race.
Since I became a demon,
I can't stand the human race.
Disgusting!
This Bento was made with love for the people I know.
I can't ignore it.
If it's disgusting, it's disgusting.
Hey, man, your blood can also be disgusting.
I give them delicious people.
But if they don't like me,
I'm just glad to have fun torturing them all night.
What kind of killer are you?
I don't like you.
If you don't like me, then...
Let's see how you overcome me!
What's going on?
No one will ever stop me!
Faster!
Faster!
Hey, I'm sorry.
Can't you cut me down while the guy is in my hand?
I don't know what to do.
I just want to kill him.
Help me.
Don't worry.
I'll save you at any cost.
Not in this life.
Yesterday...
I was a bloodthirsty woman until I got tired of it.
I see.
Now I know how fast you are.
But I wouldn't be so sure.
We thought you ran away last night
because we showed up.
But it looks like you didn't even notice us.
Apparently, you can only run away.
What?
Last night we quickly helped your victim.
And soon there will be no scars left on her.
Even if she survived,
she will live in fear for the rest of her life.
I won't let that happen.
We'll heal her emotional wounds.
And it doesn't matter how difficult it is
and how long it will take.
You're so self-satisfied.
I'd show you what it is.
I'll attack that woman again.
We'll hide her well.
And you'll never find her.
Okay, then I'll find Bento.
They have nothing to do with me.
But you know them all.
Bento sells them at the station.
I can find one.
For free.
And that's why you're upset with me.
Well, I like it.
If you want to save them,
then you have to get to the station before me.
Before that happens,
I'll finish this guy.
I'll go first.
Please, please save him.
He'll be okay.
Lay down on me.
And my friends will be here soon.
I'll go first.
I'll go first.
I'll go first.
I'll go first.
I'll go first.
My friends will be here soon.
Here!
Here!
Mr. Rengoku.
Where are the medics?
They're on their way.
I gave him the first aid.
The rest is up to you.
Focus!
You didn't hear him, did you?
If I said I'd help, then I will!
Good morning!
Hi! You're early as always!
I can hear them!
Okay!
Station manager?
What a smell! What a smell!
It's you, isn't it?
It's you, soaked in the stench of tech-bent!
I'm not mad at you!
It's all the fault of that hunter of demons!
Foucault!
Run, Foucault!
What are you doing, old crow?
Foucault!
It's you!
Are you okay?
Granny!
Damn it!
Damn it!
Hey, crow, have some mercy!
That's how you caught me!
I told you not to think!
Foucault!
Why don't we check who's faster?
Either I cut the throat of that old crow,
or you chop my head off!
There's no point in this check,
because you...
...are slow!
The breath of flame,
the first breath,
the sea of fire!
Foucault!
You...
...saved our lives...
...twice!
Granny!
I'll never...
...forget this face...
...and this Haori...
...Mama Foucault!
Granny!
Granny!
Granny!
Granny!
Granny!
I...
...twenty years ago...
...you saved our lives!
Granny, what are you saying?
I guess...
...that was my father.
I'm walking on my father's feet,
killing demons.
And it's my honor...
...to protect you,
as my father did.
I can't believe it!
Granny, I'm sorry...
...for saying that demons don't exist!
No!
That's how it should have been!
Not knowing about demons,
not facing them...
...is truly the best fate...
...that can happen!
The fire is burning!
Are you all right?
Yes.
I just finished here.
You did a great job.
Yes.
So...
...what about the endless train?
The maintenance will end at night.
And tomorrow...
...it will come back on the rails.
I'm glad to hear that.
So everything ended well?
I think it's too early to talk about it.
The demon that ate more than forty people...
...must have known...
...that it was the end of the world.
More than forty people...
...must have been much stronger than that.
So the killer was just distracting the attention?
Most likely, that's right.
Whatever it is...
...there is another demon on the endless train.
A demon that is much stronger...
...and mysterious.
It's hiding somewhere now.
Then...
...tomorrow on the endless train.
Right!
I'll sit on it!
Actually...
...today!
Hey, Pops!
Did you hear that?
What?
They say that the endless train...
...is on the move again.
I hope nothing strange will happen.
I'm sorry!
Excuse me!
Are you Bento the merchant?
I don't know...
...how to thank you for this morning.
Please...
...take this.
We have nothing else to offer you.
Oh!
That's exactly what I lacked last night.
Now I'm really happy.
Don't worry.
I'll pay for them.
No!
Enough that you're happy.
Really?
Then I'll take this.
And everything else...
...I'll buy.
What?
Take care of yourself.
Come to us again...
...if you're traveling.
I promise...
...that I'll tell my father about you.
I'm sure he'll be happy.
Be happy!
See you later!
What?
What?
What?
What is this creature?
Here's your first class, Bento.
You have 36 cents.
Would you like some tea or sake?
I'm the first one!
I'm the first one!
I'm the first one!
I'm the first one!
I'm the first one!
I'm the first one!
I'm the first one!
I'm the first one!
I'm the first one!
Stop embarrassing us!
What's going on?
Let's see what you've got for me.
Thick!
We're on an endless train!
Tanjiro!
You wanted to ask something about the Flamethrower.
I hope we'll meet him.
Yeah.
Flamethrower, you say?
Fight me!
I'm running out of booze!
Shut up, will you?
What did you say?
What kind of problems are you talking about?
All right, noses.
We've heard you.
We've heard you.
We've heard you.
We've heard you.
We've heard you.
We've heard you.
We've heard you.
We've heard you.
We've heard you.
We've heard you.
We've heard you.
I can't believe I was Ouchi-shi.
This Relentless commanding officer.
Stupendous.
Foolish.
You��솅.
Clipf deu-'s.
Stupid 자연Rein.
She's clipped.
What kind of a creee is the Flamethrower?
Well...
I'm tired of hearing you!
What's the matter?
這些妨, здесь же...
They had a strange sound.
We've lost them all!
Halosk nasty!
We've failed at finding theFlamethrower!
She knows nothing about the order!
Not even her own boss!
I wouldn't go after her!
She's though!
We're going to the shift!
She knows!
Noooo!
Yes, yes, Tanger, let's listen.
Okay, then let's start with Mrs. Shinobu.
I'll say that he's a good person.
I think sometimes we're not on the same wavelength.
Mrs. Shinobu, how nice she smells!
What about the others, Fasher?
Okay, let's listen to them all.
Bright, even brighter than me.
But he's really cool.
He's like an owl.
It's nice to hear his joyful voice.
He's a super cool little brother.
I like training with him so much.
And he's so sweet to me.
He talks a lot.
He's a good person.
I love him.
He's a good guy.
I love him.
He's positive.
He never complains.
Very honest.
Well, it turns out something like that.
Wait, what do we have here?
Wait, what about Tomioka?
That's true, Fasher.
What about Tomioka?
I see.
Tomioka wanted to say something to Rengoku.
He talks a lot to me.
I love him.
That's all?
Really?
It seems to me that everyone likes Fasher the Flame.
Yeah.
I can't wait to meet him.
Fasher the Flame!
Fasher the Flame!
Fight me!
Rengoku!
Next!
The blade that cuts demons into an endless train.
Episode 2.
Deep dream.
Let's sit on the train together.
Brother!
