Tanjiru.
Take out your blade.
There is what you have to cut.
There is what I have to cut.
There is what I have to cut to wake up.
And I think I know what it is.
Don't doubt it. Do it! Just do it!
Death in a dream leads to awakening in reality.
And that means...
What I have to cut is...
My own neck!
You must be the embodiment of the soul of this guy.
Such clean air and so carefree.
This is the core of his soul.
But why did you bring me here?
You know that I'm looking for him.
You brought me to him yourself.
How is that possible?
Even though I want to destroy him,
I can't do it.
Why?
The sun is closed in red.
Where does the car go?
On the night when the cordon is blown up,
Our voices echoed.
Light up the light of your wish.
Throw away your dreams.
And go on a white road.
In the dark sky, the star of dawn
Doesn't move the future no matter what.
So wave your hand to yesterday,
So that we can start running again.
Even if you're lost, even if you're sad,
Your life will reach out to the bright future.
So pray for the light, so that at least
The song reaches you.
Episode 4
The Scorching Honor
Where is the core of his soul?
What the hell is going on?
I don't know.
Listen.
What kind of strange unconscious zone is this?
Disgusting half-naked boar.
Why is he so strange?
What is he doing here?
Disgusting half-naked boar!
Oh my God, it's so dark here.
I can't see anything except the darkness.
It's starting to piss me off.
What kind of unconscious zone is this?
What should I do now?
Should I look for the core of my soul?
Or what?
Are you kidding me?
What was that?
What was that?
What are you doing here?
Damn parasite!
Only Nezuko has the right to come here.
I'll kill you.
Where is Nezuko?
How should I know?
In that case, die!
No!
Wake up.
I have to wake up.
Nezuko!
I'm fine.
I'm alive.
Nezuko, how are you?
Nezuko.
Zenitsu.
Inosuke.
Rengoku.
Rengoku!
Who are these guys?
I think their wrists are tied.
A rope.
The end of the rope burned out.
Nezuko burned her own blood.
It's weak, but it smells like a demon.
It smells like a ticket.
I thought so.
It also smells like a demon.
We fell asleep when we were hit by a ticket.
It's the work of a demon.
Such a weak smell.
Such a strong art of blood.
You can't use a knife.
You can only hurt.
I have to think of a way to burn the ropes.
Nezuko, please help them.
Burn the ropes.
Zenitsu, wake up!
Come on, Zenitsu, wake up!
Hurry up, wake up!
Inosuke, please!
Inosuke!
Great job. I'm sorry.
Thank you very much. You did a good job, Nezuko.
How come they haven't woken up yet?
What should I do?
Rengoku!
What are you doing?
Is this girl controlled by a demon?
Don't bother us.
It's your fault.
He won't let us sleep.
So she does it at her own will.
And this guy too.
Why are you standing?
Help us wake up.
I don't care if you're sick or not.
If you don't do your job, I'll tell him everything.
He won't put you to sleep.
Did you hear me?
So this guy was tied to me.
He has tuberculosis.
He's seriously ill.
Poor guy.
This demon has no forgiveness.
He uses the weakness of people.
I'm sorry.
But I have to fight this demon.
So you wanted to get into a sweet dream.
I understand.
I would like to stay in my dream too.
Even if it's just a dream.
I thought it was okay.
That I would hurt people.
If it would get rid of the pain caused by my illness.
But now I understand.
Are you okay?
Thank you.
And be careful.
Yes.
Let's go to the lake.
What a strong smell of the demon.
It's so heavy.
I can smell the demon.
Even in the wind.
I can't believe I slept here.
The passenger car was isolated.
I can't believe it.
It's so easy.
The demon is standing against the wind.
So it's in the head car.
Nezuko, don't follow me.
It's dangerous outside.
Wait here.
Try to wake everyone up.
Oh, you woke up.
Good morning.
But you know, you should have slept longer.
It's him.
Episode 2
Why did you wake up?
Because I showed you such a good dream.
You should thank me.
Because I could show how your relatives kill you in front of your eyes.
You worship such dreams.
I don't think it's too painful.
Maybe next time I should show you a living father?
Honestly, I like to show people nightmares
after they saw good dreams.
I like to watch how their faces are distorted.
I can't do anything with myself.
See how they are affected by grief.
And then they will be stunned and wrinkled from pain.
It's so fun.
But I have to be on guard.
It's not a direct approach, but I won't let this hunter go alive.
I mixed my blood with ink on the tickets.
When the conductor pierced them.
Then the technique started to work.
It's a remote art.
And it took more effort.
But this is the best way to avoid detection.
You had to stay unnoticed.
The dream replaces reality only while they are asleep.
And yet, why did he wake up?
He understood so quickly how to wake up.
Despite the strong desire to see happy, pleasant dreams.
The desire of people in this relationship is obvious and incredibly strong.
Don't you dare to enter someone else's heart without permission!
This is unforgivable!
What?
These are the same earrings?
What luck!
He came to me himself!
It's just perfect!
Soon I will be able to get even more blood from the Lord.
And then, when I become stronger, I will need to fight for the right to replace the High Moon.
Water breathing!
The tenth style!
Unchangeable flow!
The art of blood!
Unchangeable hypnotic whisper!
Fall asleep!
He didn't fall asleep.
Sleep!
Sleep!
Sleep!
Sleep!
Fall asleep already!
Sleep!
It doesn't work. What's going on?
No, wait.
My technique has affected him many times.
But when he understands this, he...
...kills himself to wake up.
It's possible only in a dream.
But to kill yourself...
...you will need a lot of courage.
This guy...
...is just crazy!
Brother!
Why didn't you sleep with us?
What did you do when we were dying?
Tell me, brother!
You're alive!
Father!
You're alive!
What are you doing here?
You're useless!
You should have died.
How dare you live so carelessly?
My dear ones would never say that!
Never!
I won't let you!
I won't let you!
I won't let you!
I won't let you...
...hurt...
...my family!
There's no reaction.
Is this also a dream?
Is this demon weaker than him?
Now I understand...
...why the Lord ordered me to kill you.
Together with Hasher...
...your existence...
...makes me tremble with anger!
He's not dead!
There it is!
The expression on my face that I wanted to see!
Do you want to know why I'm not dead?
Even though you cut off my head?
Good.
I'm in a great mood now.
It's so simple that even a child could understand.
It's not my real body anymore.
It's about what to say to you.
It looks like my head, but it's not.
While you were sleeping...
...I fell asleep with this train.
The whole train became my blood, my flesh...
...my bones...
...your face!
Good, good.
You understand.
In other words, more than 200 passengers of this train...
...will be the food that will make me stronger.
They are my hostages.
Can you protect them in solitude?
All the people who filled this train...
...under the bridge.
Can you slow me down?
What should I do?
I can protect passengers only in two wagons.
But I can't do more.
Rengoku! Zenitsu! Inosuke!
Enough sleeping!
Please wake up!
Nezuko!
You have to protect the sleeping!
Follow me, my minions!
Like this!
Explosive awakening!
I will attack in the direction...
...of Inosuke!
Quiet beast!
The fifth cry!
Crazy cut!
Mr. Inosuke!
Go ahead!

Turn around!
Turn around!
It's time for the secret of the Taisho!
The raven-cow-and-nose is called Dongurimaru.
Although the raven is always near the nose,
there was a case that one day he almost ate it,
so now he remains invisible.
Inosuke, I'm counting on you!
Don't confess, subordinate!
I feel completely safe when you're near, Inosuke!
Don't listen to me!
Let's go, Monjuro!
Yes!
Next, episode five, only forward!
