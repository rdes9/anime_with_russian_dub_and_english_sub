The Mages
That was fast!
I am sorry, I am sorry!
Saulsive fool, come here, come here!!!
He was so fast!
He's a Hasher?
That's Rengoku.
Do you know what he looks like?
Yes.
He has a crazy hairstyle.
And I remember his smell.
Let's go!
I think I'll recognize him as soon as we get in.
Tasty!
Tasty!
Tasty!
Tasty!

Chapter 2
Deep Sleep
Tasty!
Tasty!
Tasty!
Tasty!
Tasty!
Aah!
Let's go!
Tasty! Tasty! Tasty! Tasty!
Tasty!
Are you sure, Hoshiroflame?
Tasty!
Isn't it abjura?
Tasty! Tasty!
I'm sorry to interrupt!
Tasty!
Mr. Rengoku!
Tasty!
Well, we've already figured it out.
So you're the guy who was with the teacher?
Yes! I'm Komado Tanjiru.
They're hunters too.
Agatsuma Zenitsu and Hashibira Inosuke.
I see.
And the boxes that are behind you?
Yes.
This is my sister Nezuko.
That's right.
The demon that we've already seen.
Since she was recognized by our teacher,
I won't be against it.
Sit down.
Jolodok, the lord is cool!
You'll break the glass!
Calm down already!
Why did you get on this train?
A mission?
It was the order of Voronok Sugai.
He said that unfortunate cases on the endless train are cleared,
and then you can meet Rengoku.
Yes. Now everything is clear. I understand.
Yes.
And there is something else
that I wanted to ask you personally, Mr. Rengoku.
Ask.
What do you want?
It's about my father.
Did something happen to your father?
He was very weak and sick.
Weak and sick?
In the blizzard, the cold that could freeze the lungs,
he performed his dance.
That's great!
The thing is...
So what?
Hinokami Kagura!
Dance!
Being in danger, I remembered the dance I saw as a child.
I hoped that you would tell me everything
that you know about this dance.
I see.
But I don't know anything.
It's the first time I've heard about this dance of the god of fire.
But this dance,
performed by your father,
can be used in battle.
It looks like we've already discussed this topic.
What? Can you tell me a little bit more?
Be my student!
And I'll take care of you!
Not so fast!
And where are you looking at?
What a strange man.
The breath of fire is a long story.
In all times, the swordsmen of fire and water
have always been among the hushers.
Fire, water, wind, stone and thunder
are the main styles of breathing.
All other styles have become their branches.
Thus, the fog came from the wind.
Mizoguchi, my boy,
what color is your sword?
My name is Kamado.
My sword is black.
Black sword?
It won't be easy for you.
Not easy?
I haven't heard a black swordman become a husher.
Besides, it's hard for them to choose the style of breathing.
Be my student!
And I'll take care of you!
Not so fast!
And where are you looking at?
He's a little strange,
but at the same time caring.
Judging by the smell, he has a strong sense of justice.
It's so cool!
And so fast!
Get back! It's dangerous, fool!
I want to get out and run!
Let's see who's faster!
There must be a limit to your stupidity!
It's dangerous.
We don't know when the demon will appear.
Are you kidding?
Is the demon really on this train?
Exactly!
Are you kidding?
No!
We're not going to him!
I'm already here!
No!
I don't want to get off the train!
More than 40 people have disappeared on this train.
Several swordsmen have been sent here,
but all of them have disappeared without a trace.
Therefore, they decided to send a husher,
that is, me.
Then everything is clear!
I'm looking!
Let me check your tickets.
What is he doing?
He's a conductor.
He checks the tickets and breaks them.
Tokyo is endless.
Here.
Here.
What is it?
What is it?
There's a bad smell.
Thank you very much.
Mr. Conductor!
It's dangerous here!
This is an emergency!
Please, don't pay attention to my sword!
Red light.
It was you who hid a huge body
with the help of the blood art.
It was hard to find you.
However, if you were to talk to innocent people,
this burning sword in my hands
I want you to die!
The breath of flame.
The first style.
The sea of fire!
Unbelievable!
He killed the demon with one blow!
There's another demon here.
Follow me!
Good!
Hey! Don't leave me!
The end
Thank you for choosing us.
I won't let you hurt this man!
Didn't you hear what I said?
Your enemy is right in front of you.
What the hell?
He has very long arms.
Great! I'll attack first!
Wait! There are still people left here!
Leave them alone! Let's kill this thing!
No!
The next car is safe.
Leave.
There's no problem now.
Let's finish this quickly.
The breath of flame.
The second style.
The sunrise of the burning sun!
The end
That was...
That was...
That was amazing, brother!
Excellent swordplay!
Accept me as your student!
Of course!
You will become an excellent swordsman!
Me too!
I will take good care of you!
Brother Rengoku!
Brother!
Brother!
Brother Rengoku!
Yourizing Rengoku
I have fulfilled the order!
I've forked out the tickets and put them away.
Please, I need to sleep!
Please, let me see my late wife and daughter!
I'm begging you. I'm begging you.
As you wish.
Sleep.
You've worked hard for glory.
Now sleep.
See your family in your dreams.
I'm sorry.
What do you command us to do?
Soon their dreams will be deeper.
Wait a little longer.
The presence of demons and their thirst for blood can sometimes awaken hunters with good instincts.
Be careful. Don't touch them when you tie them up.
Now I can't leave the boundaries of the locomotive.
Work hard until I finish here.
Then you will also have beautiful dreams.
Okay.
What's going on? What happened?
Calm down. Calm down.
You have to calm down.
Brother.
Brother, you're back.
Have you already sold all the coal?
Brother.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.
Quietly and calmly die in a dream.
How lucky you are.
There is no way back even for a strong hunter.
The human desire comes from the heart, from the soul.
You just have to destroy their soul core.
Do this and they will become living corpses.
Human hearts are the same.
They are all so fragile, as if made of glass.
The rope must be tied to the wrist?
Yes. And remember what he told us.
Breathe slowly.
Think in your mind.
So you will dive into a deep sleep.
One.
Two.
Three.
Four.
Five.
Six.
Six.
And then my brother cried.
I was so amazed.
He's so strange.
It must be.
Tanjirah is just tired.
Don't be so fussed.
Everything is fine.
You didn't catch a cold?
Don't overwork yourself.
Have a rest at home today.
I'm fine.
Are you sure?
Hey, stop it!
I got you!
What are you doing?
Come on, stop fooling around.
I have a feeling.
As if I had a dream.
A real nightmare.
Sweet, sweet.
Go to sleep.
Forget about breathing.
The demon will come right away.
And the stomach will pierce you.
It seems they are happy.
They all see beautiful dreams.
Slowly.
Slowly.
Dive into sleep.
Into an endless sleep.
From which you will never wake up.
