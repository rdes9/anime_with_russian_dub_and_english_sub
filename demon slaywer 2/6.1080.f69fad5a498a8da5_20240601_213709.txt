Don't bother me to fall asleep!
Did he hurt you?
I'm fine.
Why are you fighting this bastard?
We won't let him die.
We have to cut the demon's neck,
otherwise the rest won't last long.
We have to cut the demon's neck,
otherwise the rest won't last long.
We have to cut the demon's neck,
otherwise the rest won't last long.
There's no point falling asleep now!
There's no point falling asleep now!
It's a bad idea!
It's a bad idea!
It's a bad idea!
Excuse me!
Excuse me!
Cover me!
Silence of the beast, the fourth cry!
Cut into pieces!
Father, please give me your strength!
Let me cut through their necks!
With one blow!
Hinokami Kagura!
Blue sky!
To be continued
Light up the light of your wish
Throw away your dreams
And go down the white road
In the dark sky, the star of dawn
Doesn't move no matter what
So wave your hand to yesterday
We will cry
To start running again
Even if you're lost, even if you're lamenting
Life will reach out to the bright side
So pray for the light, the sky is high
So that your singing voice can reach at least you

Episode 6
Akaza
Hinokami Kagura!
Blue sky!
To be continued
That horrible scream and shaking!
It's turning upside down!
Inosuke!
What?
Is your animal unharmed?
Yes!
Inosuke, please protect the passengers!
I can't die.
If I die, this man will become a murderer!
I can't die just like that!
And I don't want anyone else to die!
You're okay, Sander!
Hold on!
The demon's blood is on the spring!
That saved me!
Cool, huh?
Hey, you're alive!
You're wounded!
I'm...
I'm totally fine.
What about you?
I'm totally fine!
I'm not scratched!
I'm fine!
I'm totally fine!
I'm not scratched!
I...
I can't move yet.
Please go and help the others.
There must be wounded here.
The driver was...
...near the neck.
It's okay if he dies!
You can't say that!
He spat you in the stomach!
His leg is jammed, and he can't move!
His leg is crushed, but he won't be able to walk!
He'll die anyway!
But he already has enough suffering.
Please help him.
Please.
Okay!
It's because I'm the boss!
I have a subordinate!
And after I help him,
I'll pull out all his hair!
Don't do that!
The dawn is coming.
I need to recover my breath.
I need...
...to help...
...the wounded!
Nezuko...
Zenitsu...
Rengoku...
They must be alive!
I'm sure of it!
My body is falling apart.
I can't recover.
I lost.
I'm dying.
I...
It's impossible!
It's impossible!
It's absurd!
I haven't eaten a single person!
My plan is to get off the train
and eat a bunch of people
for one sitting!
Just look at me!
After all I've gone through!
It's all his fault!
I took 200 people hostage,
but they still resisted me!
They pressed me down!
That's the power of the Hasher!
He's also very fast,
even with my technique!
And that girl!
Isn't she a demon?
So what the hell?
A demon on the side of the hunters?
Why hasn't the boss killed her yet?
Damn it!
In any case,
everything went wrong
when that bastard woke up!
It's definitely his fault!
It's all his fault!
It's all his fault!
And that boar is with him at the same time!
I want to kill that guy at least!
But the boar also got in my way!
He has a strong intuition,
and he also knew where my look was going!
Everything is over!
I'm going to die!
It's a nightmare!
A nightmare!
A nightmare!
The lowest of the moons
are always killed by the hunters
and demons,
and the highest of the moons
are demons whose rank
has not changed for hundreds of years!
They killed many hunters,
even the Hasher was driven to the grave!
They are at a completely different level!
I will never be compared
to them!
I want to start all over again!
Give me another try!
What a pity!
Nightmare!
You use full concentration all the time?
It's impressive!
Renkoku!
This is one of the steps
on the way to the title of Hasher!
But to become a Hasher,
you need to take 10,000 steps!
I'll try!
You're bleeding!
Try to focus
and balance your breath!
Focus on a specific part of the body!
This is a blood vessel,
it's damaged!
Focus more!
That's right!
You found it!
Now try to stop!
Focus!
That's it!
You stopped it!
If you control your breath,
you will be able to do a lot!
Of course, not for everything in the world,
but you will become stronger!
Much stronger than you were before!
Yes!
Passengers are safe!
There are many wounded,
but no one is dead!
You need to rest!
Try not to move one more time!
Thank you very much!
To be continued...
Where are you,
High Moon?
What is he doing here?
Burning Breath!
Second style!
Sunrise!
Sunrise!
Good game!
Good game!
He recovered quickly,
and this is the most worrisome feeling!
The highest rank demon!
Why did you attack the wounded first?
Why do you need him?
I thought he could get involved
in our talk.
What are you going to do with this?
What are you going to do with this?
And what are you going to talk to me about?
We've only just met, but I already hate you.
Really?
Most of all, I hate weaklings.
I'm getting goosebumps from this sight.
We have completely different moral values.
Let me make a great offer.
Why don't I become a demon for you?
Never.
I can see that you're very strong.
You're a Hasher, aren't you?
You almost brought your fighting spirit to perfection.
I'm a Hasher of flame, Rengoku Kyojuro.
And I'm a Kazo.
Listen, Kyojuro, do you understand why you never reach perfection?
Because you're a human.
Sooner or later, you'll grow old and die.
Become a demon, Kyojuro.
If you agree, you'll be able to train for hundreds of years.
You'll become stronger.
Among all the demons I've met, he smells the strongest, Kibutsuji.
I need to help him. Where's my sword?
Adolescence and death give meaning and beauty to human life.
Our life is valuable and unique because we grow old and die.
Strength is not a word that has anything to do with the body.
And this boy is not weak.
Don't insult him.
I can repeat once again.
We have different moral values.
And I have many reasons not to become a demon.
I see.
Expansion technique.
Destruction of the target, arrow of the compass.
I see.
If you don't want to become a demon, I'll kill you.
I can't keep an eye on them.
I killed different hushers, but there were no hushers of flame among them.
And none of the hushers have still accepted my offer.
Why are they like that?
How do you know?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Why are they like that?
Like the one who also goes on the path of war.
I don't understand them.
After all, you can't become a demon yourself.
You have to be chosen.
Working hard to break such a talent is an empty waste of time.
I can never accept this.
Then die, Kyochiro.
While you are young and strong.
Destruction of the target.
Free style.
Got you.
Breath of flame.
Fourth style.
Waves of blazing fire.
He hits the air, but his hits still reach me.
And he's incredibly fast.
If we continue to fight at a distance, it will be difficult to cut off his head.
In this case...
Fourth style.
I'll come close.
Yes, incredible speed.
And wonderful sword control.
And that's it, it ends in summer.
Kyochiro, aren't you sad?
That's what happens.
This is what it means to be a human.
Don't move.
If it opens early, you will die.
Your time has not yet come.
Don't waste time on this weak Kyochiro.
Fight me with all your might.
Focus on me.
Wonderful movements.
Rengoku!
Doll eyes!
It's too early to die, Kyochiro.
If you die, we won't be able to continue to test our strength against each other.
You have only one way out.
I refuse.
I'll say it again.
I hate you.
And I will never become a demon.
Flame breathing.
Third style.
Flaming souls.
Excellent! Impressive ability.
Destruction of the goal.
Free style.
No doubt.
I can't get in.
I can't follow their movements.
As if they were in another dimension.
I feel it.
If I get too close, I'll die instantly.
Don't even move.
Because if I get in, there will be no point.
Rengoku!
Don't you understand yet?
If you keep attacking me, your death will be inevitable, Kyochiro.
Flame breathing. First style.
Sea of fire.
It's a pity to kill you now.
Because you didn't reveal all your potential.
Flame breathing.
Second style.
Sunbathing.
In a year or two, you would become much stronger.
You would become more deadly.
Third style.
Flaming souls.
Fourth style.
Flames of fire.
Destruction of the goal.
Fifth style.
Flaming tiger.
My power.
Kyochiro!
Kyochiro!
He did it! He overcame him!
How could this be?
How is this possible?
How did he do it?
How did he do it?
How did he do it?
How did he do it?
How did he do it?
Keep fighting!
Don't you dare die, Kyochiro!
Kyochiro!
Kyochiro!
Rengoku!
Rengoku!
Cockatoo eyes!
Rengoku!
Rengoku!
Kyochiro!
Kyochiro!
Kyochiro!
Kyochiro!
Kyochiro!
Kyochiro!
Rengoku!
Rengoku!
I will fulfill my duty!
