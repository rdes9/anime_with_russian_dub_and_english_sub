Episode 20
The Prey Family
Nezuko! Nezuko!
I... I won. I won.
My father saved me.
I don't quite understand how I attacked Kagura, which was passed down from generation to generation.
But it saved me.
I was able to defeat him.
I don't see Nezuko.
It's because I've been breathing for too long.
My ears are ringing.
My whole body is in pain.
I need to get my strength together.
The battle is not over yet.
I have to save Inosuke.
Right now!
The smell of blood has intensified.
If you think about it, I didn't smell the smell of ash.
Just don't say it.
He survived at least a little.
He survived even though I cut off his head.
Did you think you could beat me, poor child?
Are you satisfied with your own illusions?
I cut off my head with my own threads before you could cut it off.
Enough.
I'll kill you and your sister.
I haven't been there for a long time.
Get up! Get up now!
Take your breath under control.
Hurry up! Now!
But I wonder why you didn't burn up.
The fire only touched me and my threads.
I don't know if it was your sister's power, but thank you for making me angry.
Now I can relax.
If you breathe correctly, it doesn't matter how tired you are.
The art of demonic blood.
The art of killing eyes.
Don't panic.
Don't lose your breath.
Calm down.
If only it's possible.
I can't raise my hand.
I can't.
I can't.
I can't.
I can't raise my hand.
There's someone here.
It's Zenitsu.
You did a good job holding on until I came.
Leave the rest to me.
You're like an endless stream of monsters in my way.
The art of demonic blood.
The ring of cutting threads.
Full concentration.
Water breathing.
The eleventh style.
Style.
The eleventh style?
Who cares about your eleventh style?
What?
What's going on? What did he do?
All my threads are broken.
As soon as I got closer to him,
and none of them reached him,
he cut my strongest threads.
It's just impossible.
Once again.
The eleventh style.
I couldn't do it.
I couldn't.
I was the only one who was able to do it.
To become a family.
Finally, we've got her in the corner.
Hey, look!
Demon?
Just a child.
But even if it's a child,
it's still a child.
It's still a child.
It's still a child.
It's still a child.
But even if it's a child,
it's still a demon.
If you let him go,
he will eat people.
Hey, hey.
Do you want me to save you?
But instead,
you do what I say.
I'll do everything.
I'll do anything.
Please save me.
Then become a member of my family.
Yes, I will.
What are they talking about?
Okay.
It's over for you.
Welcome.
From this day on,
you are also a part of my family.
Drink it.
In our family,
Rui was the strongest.
Since we were weak demons,
Rui divided our strength.
Since Rui was his favorite,
he received a special permission to drink it.
Yes, Rui was the strongest.
He was the strongest.
It's good that he's still alive.
Yes, it's good that he's still alive.
He's alive.
He's alive because he's alive.
A special permit for this.
You feel it.
You shouldn't be afraid of these demon hunters anymore.
And now it's time for the last stroke.
Now you can raise your head.
Congratulations.
Now you're a real family member.
Home
Heaven
You tried to fool us.
What?
There's no open communication between us. We're just a group of strangers.
I'm so sorry.
I'll try harder, Rui.
I'll practice. I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry I can't make it.
Sometimes I turn into something completely random.
I don't want to hear your apologies, Mom.
I know what I have to do, Rui.
We were so afraid of the demon hunters and wanted to find allies.
It's not that we wanted to take part in this game into the family.
But those who didn't fulfill Rui's requests or orders
either were cut off, or lost their minds.
I don't know what to do with them.
I've had enough of it.
I pretend I've never heard it from you.
I know you're not stupid, unlike the others.
Let's run away together.
I won't tell anyone about it except you.
You're the only one I really consider my own son to be.
Tomorrow, Rui will summon that man and he'll come down from the mountain.
It's our chance to escape.
I'm sorry, Rui, but I don't know what to do with you.
I don't know what to do with you.
I don't know what to do with you.
I don't know what to do with you.
I don't know what to do with you.
I don't know what to do with you.
You've disappointed me.
They were fools.
But I'm not like that.
Even so, I couldn't do it.
Rui! Rui!
Mother was killed.
And our older brother too.
What are we going to do?
The demon hunters are already close.
Listen, isn't it better to run away?
No!
You know,
I really don't like it when your face changes.
What are you looking at?
It's not a show for you.
He just cut my face.
I was easy to get rid of.
Demon!
What the?
It's useless.
You'll never cut it.
My club may seem soft,
but it's very strong.
No!
First, the acid will dissolve your clothes,
and then it will be your turn.
It will instantly soften your body and I will eat you.
Wow!
Amazing!
You're releasing these threads straight from your palm?
Good evening.
The moon is beautiful today.
You're not going to be my friend, are you?
Wait!
Please!
I was forced to do it.
If I refuse, he will cut me into pieces.
Really?
It's so sad.
I'll help you.
Let's be friends.
Are you going to help me?
Yes.
But to become friends,
I have to ask you a couple of questions.
Dear young girl,
how many people did you kill?
Five.
But I was ordered.
I had no choice.
But you don't have to lie.
I already know.
The technique with which you locked my friend in the kitchen
was just great.
You ate at least 80 people.
No, of course I didn't eat that much.
I killed only five.
But you know, I came here from the West.
The West, my dear.
On the western slope of the mountain,
I saw many coconuts hanging on the trees.
People inside them turned into liquid.
All of them were killed.
Only there I counted at least 40 coconuts.
40 people.
All of them are dead.
Oh, it doesn't make me angry.
I just want to know the exact number.
What's the point of this for you?
You'll get the appropriate punishment
and start a new life.
Punishment?
So we can become friends.
If you are not punished for taking so many lives,
your victims will not have justice.
I can tear out your eyes
or cut your stomach and tear out your organs.
I will torture you
for every person killed by you.
And after you endure all these sufferings and pain,
your sins will be forgiven.
Let's try our best.
Don't worry.
Since you are a demon, dear,
there will be no consequences for you.
Stop joking!
Die, damn witch!
Apparently, we will never be friends.
What a pity.
Okay, made up your mind.
That's just a prayer for my husband.
Insect breathing, butterfly dance, caprice.
My head is not chopped off.
What is noticed and used?
I see.
It is too fragile and weak to chop off the head.
I can overcome it.
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Do not weaken your vigilance,
only because you have not been chopped off the head,
because such swordswomen as I use poison.
I am a hunter for the demons of the husher of insects.
I want Shinobu.
Perhaps I am the only swordswoman among the hushers
who is not capable of beheading a demon.
But since I created a deadly poison for demons,
I also deserve a surprise.
Oh, I'm sorry.
You're already dead and you can't hear me.
I'm sorry.
Are you all right?
Barely.
What happened to the demon?
Didn't you kill her?
I killed her with the poison from glycine.
She is dead.
If we leave her here, she will rot.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
So she is in no good condition.
No, she is dramatic.
She even fainted for saying so.
Can't do anything there.
If I take her to the patient in the first place,
it has no option,
it is invisible to him.
When I help Lisa to mountains,
she can't think deeply.
Come on.
Willy,
I will leave granule to you.
Go on.
Farewell!
Stop.
Nezuko! Nezuko!
I'll kill them! I'll kill them! I'll kill these kids! At any cost! These kids!
What do you want to do, Roy? What does family mean to you?
I don't know. Because I have no human memories left.
That's why you made us pretend to be a family.
I thought I'd feel the connection between us. My memories will come back.
Because we're a real family.
That's right. I'm...
Nezuko!
Nezuko!
Nezuko!
To be continued...
It's amazing! You've created a poison that kills demons!
I'm a student of pharmaceutical science. Being a demon hunter means not only swinging a sword.
I see.
And now it's time for the secret of Taisho.
I store my poison right in the needs. And no one knows about it except me and my blacksmith.
Great! Now I'm going to be famous with a special sword too!
First of all, you have to learn not to lose your clothes.
What a sharp remark!
Next, episode 21. Against the rules of the squad.
It's great to have high ambitions. Let's do our best!
