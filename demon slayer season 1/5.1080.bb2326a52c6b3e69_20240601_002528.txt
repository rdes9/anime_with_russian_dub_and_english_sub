These masks look like a mark.
Because they were wearing them, I ate them.

Urokodaki!
Damn, damn, damn!
Damn it!
My body is falling apart and disappearing.
I can't stop it.
Damn it!
The face of this demon-killer is the last thing I'll ever see in my life.
How could it all turn out like this?
I'm scared. I'm all alone.
Brother, where are you?
Take me by the hand, like you always do.
Why?
I've eaten my own brother.
What kind of brother am I thinking about?
The smell of sadness.
The smell of sadness.
God, please.
God, please.
When this man is reborn, don't let him become a demon again.
Brother! Brother! Brother!
Take me by the hand!
You're hopeless. You're such a cowardly kitten.
You're hopeless. You're such a cowardly kitten.
Sabito, Makomo, and all those who were killed.
I won.
Rest in peace.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I won.
Rest in peace.
I think you'll come home, like you promised.
Even though you're just souls, you'll come back to Mount Sagiri.
To the teacher Urokodaki who loves you so much.
If I died here, my soul would come back there too.
I want to ask you something.
How do I turn a demon back into a human?
Please tell me how to turn Nezuko back into a human.
Please tell me how to turn Nezuko back into a human.
Glicynia.
I did it.
Only four people?
But there were at least 20.
And I don't see that guy here.
I don't see that guy here.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
No, boy.
It's all because I got distracted,
I got distracted,
I couldn't save him.
I'm gonna die.
I'm gonna die.
Even if I survive right now.
Even if I survive right now,
I'm gonna die.
Welcome back.
Congratulations.
I'm glad you're safe and sound.
So, what do we do now, huh?
Where's my sword?
First, you need to take off your uniforms.
We'll take your measurements,
and then we'll measure your rank.
There are 10 ranks in total.
Hinoe, kinoto.
Hinoe, kinoto.
Tsuchinoe, tsuchinoto.
Kanoe, konoto.
Mizunoe, mizunoto.
Now you're in the lowest rank, mizunoto.
So, what about the swords?
Today we'll let you choose the ore for your blades.
However, it will take 10 to 15 days to make them.
Are you kidding me?
For starters...
We'll assign each of you a Kasugai thief.
Kasugai thief?
Kasugai thieves are mainly used for communication.
You said a thief?
Isn't that a raven?
Don't be ridiculous!
Who's going to take care of some stupid raven?
I need a blade, got it?
Give it to me right now!
A blade of a demon killer!
A blade of a changing color!
Give it to me right now!
Or I'll break your arm!
Who are you?
What am I supposed to do?
Try it!
Are you done?
Then please choose the ore for your blade.
The steel for the blade, which will destroy demons and protect you, will be chosen by you personally.
But I don't think I'll live very long.
They ask us to choose.
But how do we choose one of them?
I've never seen ore before.
And I don't see any difference in them.
I have no idea.
What?
I see.
Only five of them survived.
Excellent.
The number of my children has grown again.
I wonder what kind of swordsmen they will be.
I was so naive.
I couldn't even talk to the demon normally.
They constantly attacked me and tried to kill me.
I'm sorry, Nezuko.
I didn't manage to find out from them how to turn demons into humans.
Even the clothes seem heavy to me.
I want to go home as soon as possible.
But my whole body hurts terribly.
I did it.
Nezuko.
Rokodaki's teacher.
Hey!
Nezuko!
You...
You woke up!
Nezuko!
Help me.
Why?
Why did you suddenly fall asleep?
You didn't wake up.
I was scared you would die.
I was afraid you were going to die.
You came back to us alive.
I see. You killed that huge demon.
Yes.
Finally.
I'm really surprised that you're back.
Yes.
There are several types of demons.
Demons using special magic.
The art of demonic blood is extremely strong.
From now on, you will have to fight with such demons.
And the battles with them will be more difficult than everything you've faced before.
And despite that, I'm sure, Tanjiro, everything will be fine with you.
Yes.
I think Nezuko doesn't look like other demons.
Do you think it could be art, as you said?
No, I don't think so.
I wouldn't say that this is the result of the art of demonic blood.
It's just an assumption.
But I think Nezuko is restoring her strength in her sleep.
Instead of eating human flesh.
I'll protect you, Nezuko.
Fifteen days later.
My name is Haganezuko.
I forged a blade for Tanjiro Kamado.
And I came to give it to you.
Oh, it's me, Tanjiro Kamado.
Please come in.
This is Nichirin's blade.
And I forged it.
Please come in, I can offer you a check.
The raw material for the Nichirin blade, obtained from the depths of the mountains,
closest to the sun.
The blue iron sand and the blue iron ore.
The melted steel from them can absorb the sunlight.
Oh, is that true?
The mountain of yoko bathes in the sunlight all year round.
There is no such thing as...
Again, you're so annoying.
You never listen to what others say.
A clown mask!
Oh, you're the Sun Child, aren't you?
That's what I call luck.
Oh, no, I'm the son of Tanjiro and Kiyo.
That's not what I meant.
You see, your hair and eyes are red.
When people who work with fire have such a child as you,
it is considered a very good sign.
Really? I didn't know about that.
Most likely, this blade will turn red.
Isn't that right, Urokodaki?
Yes.
Well, get him out of here.
Nichirin blades are known as blades that change color.
They change color depending on the owner.
Oh!
Black!
Is it black?
It's bad if it turns black.
It's unfortunate.
No, it's not.
But such dark blades are rarely found.
I hoped so much that it would be bright red!
Damn it!
Stop it!
Please calm down!
How old are you?
I'm 37!
Tanjiro team!
Listen to my order!
He's talking.
Hurry to the city in the northwest!
Young girls are starting to disappear there!
Every night, young girls disappear!
Follow the hidden demon there and kill him!
Get ready for this task, Tanjiro team!
This is your first task!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
This is your first task as a demon killer!
My first task...
My first task...
My first task...
My first task...
My first task...
My first task...
My first task...
My first task...
My first task...
My first task...
My first task...

Voroniert сów Boss!
Doozy!
Drumroll for everyone!
Honestly, I don't follow your orders.
Hey, you! If you let him go, I'll strangle you!
Hey!
