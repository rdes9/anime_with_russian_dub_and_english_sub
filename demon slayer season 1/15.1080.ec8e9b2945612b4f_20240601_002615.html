Contaminants for demons have joined the armed forces not to have fun
Ð¹ You understand that?!
People like you have to be eliminated now!
Not underestimating demon hunters!

Nezuko!
Nezuko!
Nezuko!
Zenitsu! Stop stalking her!
Tanjiro!
Let's be friends, Tanjiro!
Zenitsu! Stop running after us, I beg you!
Oh, don't behave like that, Tanjiro!
Nezuko!
Tanjiro!
Stop!
Nezuko!
Tanjiro!
Oh my god, there's a hunt!
I'm sorry, sir.
All your clothes got dirty in the dust, as I can see.
I'll wash it for you, so please put it on for now.
It's very pleasant to the touch and pretty comfortable.
How do you like the tempo for lunch?
It's what you soaked in oil and fried.
Hey, wait!
Come back, Nezuko!
What for?
Wait, wait! Stop running after us, I beg you!
Tanjiro!
Episode 15
Mount Natagumo
You've recovered.
North-north-east! North-north-north-east!
The next mission is north-north-north-east!
The three of you need to go to Mount Natagumo.
Go to Mount Natagumo!
We're going.
We're going.
We're going.
We're going.
We're going.
We're going.
Thank you for everything.
Then, good luck.
Thank you very much.
What are you doing, old witch?
Are you crazy, moron?
She's cutting out the spark of good luck.
It's a ritual of healing.
After all, our mission is very dangerous.
Go through life with a highly raised head.
And good luck in battles.
With a high head?
Good luck in battles?
What does it all mean?
God, this guy doesn't know anything.
By the way, yes.
If you think so, it's really hard.
With a highly raised head.
I think we should understand our place in the world,
follow our principles so that we never feel ashamed of ourselves.
Probably.
And that old woman is also praying for our safety.
And what kind of place is this?
And what does it mean to never feel ashamed?
Well, it's...
And what exactly does it mean to follow the principles?
And what the hell is this old woman praying for our safety?
Why the hell did we give up on her?
Why is she praying for us?
It looks like she doesn't understand her place.
He's speeding up.
He can't beat me.
He can't beat me!
Stop!
Wait!
Is it hard to wait for me?
Zenitsu, what's going on?
I'm scared!
The closer we are to their destination, the more I'm scared.
Why the hell did he sit down?
How scary are you?
Who would say, boarhead?
Just don't say you don't feel anything from that mountain.
But what's good about sitting here?
I told you he's scary.
I'm not scary at all!
I'm normal!
Normal!
And you're all normal!
What?
What's wrong?
Hey!
What's that smell?
Tanjiro!
Wait!
Come on!
Don't leave me here!
Don't leave me!
Save me!
He's wearing our uniform!
He's a hunter!
Something's happened to him!
Wait!
Are you okay?
What happened?
They're attached to me!
Save me!
I'm going there.
I'm going forward!
And you can follow me, you coward!
I'm already hungry.
And your socks?
It's hard enough for me to wear socks.
I don't have any socks.
I don't have any socks.
I don't have any socks.
I don't have any socks.
I don't have any socks.
It's hard enough for you.
Let's go!
Let's go!
What the hell?
Is that a spiderweb?
God, it's full of spiders!
What a scum!
You're right.
It's a spiderweb.
It's a spiderweb.
It's a spiderweb.
God, it's a spiderweb.
It's a spiderweb.
You're right.
The socks?
What's going on?
Thank you.
Uh?
You told me that you'd come with me.
It makes me feel better.
The mountain smells distorted.
I'm nervous about it.
Thank you.
It is very pleasant to the touch and quite comfortable.
Lead a life with a high head.
And good luck in battles!
Inosuke!
Let's go!
We are here to help.
I am Team Tanjirou, rank Mizunoto.
Mizunoto?
Mizunoto?
Why didn't they send Hasher?
No matter how much Mizunoto came, it's useless.
Useless!
Inosuke!
Shut up!
If you say something is meaningless, then your existence itself is meaningless.
And now tell us what's going on here, you miserable rope.
What kind of guy is this?
Did you forget that I'm more experienced than you?
Warren gave us an order.
Ten hunters came here.
Soon after we climbed the mountain.
Hunters!
Hunters began to kill each other!
I...
I...
I...
I...
I...
I...
I...
Good thing you're back.
That means most of my children were killed.
This should be the case of the Demon's Twelve Cells.
Apparently, someone from Hasher should be sent there.
I...
I...
I...
What do you say?
If people and demons could get along with each other, what do you think, Miyoko?
It's impossible until demons eat people.
Interesting.
Do they hate me?
Do people leave their friends on the road?
If we're friends, why didn't they persuade me?
If they both tried, I would go.
I would definitely go.
But no, they both continued to climb this terrible mountain.
They left me here alone.
You can't help the poor. Now you have to help your friends.
You're lucky. You don't care.
You don't understand anything about people's affairs.
You're not nice at all! Not at all!
You're not nice at all! Not at all!
You're not nice at all! Not at all!
You're not nice at all! Not at all!
You're not nice at all! Not at all!
You're not nice at all!
Seriously, not at all!
Even Nezuko, being a demon, is incredibly cute.
You're just a crow, but you're so cruel!
He took Nezuko with him!
Why did he take my precious Nezuko with him?
Damn Tanjiro!
You can't put girls in danger!
Fool, fool, fool, fool, fool!
Nezuko!
What kind of sound is that?
And again!
That sound again!
I heard that sound!
And in the next moment everyone started killing each other!
Where does it come from?
You really hate this game?
Takeshi, what is it?
Something's going on!
Yes, after that...
No way!
Flamingos!
What?
Don't focus on me!
Let's go, everyone in the castle!
Then turn your attention to the entities cornbed of Gohan!
Turn to Tohoku!
Gohan is a became a god in Gohan!
Gohan, slayer of Gohan.
You mean, they know how to exaggerate?
on maps where they were made.
They are all idiots.
No tell goes that it is forbidden for hunters to fight against each other.
That is not the point.
They are all weird.
Okay, then I'll cut them into pieces!
No! They're alive!
Some of them are still alive!
Besides, our comrades' corpses can't be harmed!
Stop forbidding me everything in the world!
I can smell a strange sweet smell behind him!
These are threads!
They're controlled by threads!
Cut the threads!
I realized that earlier than you said!
And where is that demon?
What was controlling them?
What is this?
What a strange smell!
Just a moment!
This is...
Spiders!
Spiders are tied to them by these threads!
That means...
And now, my beautiful dolls,
dance until your arms and legs are torn off!
Cutting them is not enough!
Spiders will easily tie new threads to them!
Then...
Again this sharp smell!
What is this?
It was brought here by the wind!
So all we have to do is kill the damn spiders?
It's impossible!
Spiders are too small, and there are too many of them!
It's easier to find a demon that controls them!
These are useless socks!
Socks!
If you can somehow determine the location of the demon,
then help me!
I caught this strange smell,
and my nose is useless now!
And also...
I'm Murata!
Murata!
Murata and I will come up with a way to deal with the controls!
And you, socks...
Do not disrupt the peaceful life of my family!
Is he steaming?
No!
He's standing on these threads!
What family was he talking about?
My mother will kill you in a few moments!
Mother?
Damn!
Where are you going?
Fight me!
Fight!
And socks!
Why did he even appear?
This child is unlikely to be the demon that controls the threads!
For starters, let's...
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
I got it!
Do you want me to find where the demon is hidden?
Shut up already, you lazy!
The animal's breathing!
Seventh style!
Spatial review!
I found it!
Where are you?
I will not let anyone stand in our way,
because I want the family of five to be able to live happily,
and no one will tear our bones apart!
I will not let anyone stand in our way,

THE END
THE END
Nezuko! Tanjiro!
Where are you?
Nezuko is in danger!
Nichiriko, help me find her chun-taro!
Why did you run away?
Eat and calm down!
When you're full, help me with the searches,
because Nezuko is in danger!
Nezuko!
