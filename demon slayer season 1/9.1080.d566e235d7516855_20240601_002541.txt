I wonder how we would kill them.
I feel the power flowing through my veins, because I got his blood.
Of course we will kill him as cruel as possible.
Lie down!
Have you decided how we will kill him?
Of course we will kill him as cruel as possible.

The Blade of the Disrupting Demon
You were right, Yahaba.
The house appeared where there was nothing.
The manifestation of the art of demonic blood is capable of revealing objects.
There is a hunter of demons, and he is with demons?
What is going on here?
Isn't it fun?
In any case, Susamaru, you are doing everything like a child.
So senseless.
You soiled me.
You soiled my Kimono with dust.
Stop whining.
We found them only thanks to my Temarii.
Temarii, is that clear?
Then we can have fun from the bottom of our hearts.
I'm all dusty again.
You're so worried, and your Kimono didn't get dirty.
Not at all.
I found it, I found it.
Temarii?
She destroyed the house by just leaving Temarii?
This is the girl.
She is one of the Kibutsuji.
My Lady!
Yushiro!
Damn it!
Nezuko, take that woman unconscious to a safe place.
It's too dangerous outside.
We have a basement, take her there.
I got you, Nezuko.
I killed someone.
Her smell is significantly different from the smell of other demons.
She's stronger.
This smell is very heavy.
I can feel the heaviness even in the light ones.
The hunter of demons that Sergi Hanafuda carries.
It's you, right?
So their goal is me?
Lady Tamaya, please hide somewhere.
These demons came for me.
Tanjirou, don't worry about us.
Focus on your battle.
Everything will be fine without your protection.
Because we are demons.
Great!
Now you're done!
Even if I turn around, this Demari will turn around.
Out of all ten styles,
the fastest and most accurate technique.
Full concentration, water breathing.
Seventh style.
A piercing blow, a drop of water.
Oh, you made a crooked blow to soften Tamari's blow.
But...
Why is this Demari still moving?
He naturally turned around when he hit Yoshiro.
There were no signs of rotation, but still...
What was that?
Yoshiro...
Yoshiro...
Lady Tamaya!
Didn't I tell you from the very beginning
that we shouldn't meet this hunter?
My hiding technique is still not perfect.
You know it very well.
I can hide the presence of buildings and people, their smell,
but I can't hide their existence itself.
The more people, the more traces,
and the higher the probability that Kimutsuji will find us.
These demons came so close to us,
but I didn't sense their smell before they attacked.
Is it because of the art of demonic blood, Yoshiro?
I hate people who come and stop us from spending time together!
I hate everyone!
I'm sorry!
He's still talking.
How fun! How fun it is!
The death of one of the demons from my hand in the twelfth moon
is a great honor.
The demons from the twelfth moon?
They serve Mamugi Kimutsuji.
She's grown her arms!
And now we will continue to play until dawn,
until the end of your life!
If I use my technique now,
Tanger will be under its influence.
And Yoshiro needs time to switch to combat mode.
If it continues...
Again!
They change the direction of movement right in the air!
When I cut them, their power is reduced.
But even so, they hit me!
Two different smells of blood.
There are two demons here.
I can track them by smell.
But!
The two demons are fighting!
Miss Tamaya! Yoshiro!!
Bad! I have no time to protect them!
We'll get there soon!
Do not worry!
Hey!
Damned demon hunter!
If you see arrows, you will know where the swords are flying!
Avoid the arrows!
I'll show you what I see myself!
This will allow you to get rid of that girl from Temari!
I see!
She's using these arrows...
...to control Temari's trajectory!
Thank you, Yushiro!
Now I see the arrows too!
Then get rid of her!
Nezuko!
Nezuko, go outside!
Take care of the tree demons!
I'm the one you need!
Who do you need?
The demon hunter who's wearing Hanafuda's earrings.
Undoubtedly.
I'll bring him your galoshka.
This is so much fun!
Nezuko!
How much longer?
They're gone!
Water breathing!
The third style!
Dancing flow!
Miss Tamayo!
Miss Tamayo!
Miss Tamayo!
Miss Tamayo!
Miss Tamayo!
So these demons are close to Kibutsuji?
Most likely.
Then I'll definitely get their blood!
I have two requests for you.
First, permission to study the blood of your sister.
Second, take samples of the blood of the demons closest to Kibutsuji.
I mean the demons closest to Kibutsuji,
whose strength corresponds to the strength of Kibutsuji himself.
It's not an easy task to get the blood of such demons.
The third style!
Dancing flow!
Miss Tamayo!
So these demons are close to Kibutsuji?
Most likely.
Do you think you'll get our blood?
I don't know what you came up with.
But I won't let you do anything that will make him unhappy.
If you think you can get the blood of demons in 12 bodies,
I'll let you do it.
I'll let you do it.
I'll let you do it.
I'll let you do it.
If you think you can get the blood of demons in 12 bodies,
I'll let you do it.
Be careful!
Don't lose your vigilance for a second!
If they're really demons in 12 bodies,
then they're probably much stronger than the demons you killed before.
Okay, got it.
Be careful.
Don't lose your vigilance.
Probably before.
Okay, get to the bottom of it.
Miss Tamayo,
let's use them as bait and get out of here.
I'm kidding!
She wouldn't get up.
She's so dirty!
It's been a couple of seconds,
and she's got new hands.
She recovers much faster than the demons in the final selection.
I'll give him your head.
Nazuko!
And now, why don't you die?
Are you okay, Nazuko?
Hey, hunter!
Get rid of the guy with the arrows first,
and we'll take care of Miss Tamayo with your sister.
Got it!
Nazuko, don't do anything wrong.
I'm counting on you.
I swear,
I'll get their blood.
If this will allow me to create the medicine at least a minute earlier,
I'll fight any demon,
I'll fight and defeat him!
Here it is!
The Intermediate Thread!
The Intermediate Thread!
The Intermediate Thread!
The Intermediate Thread!
Here it is!
The Intermediate Thread!
What a dirty boy!
Stay away from me!
The thread...
broke!
It hurts!
I mean, it really hurts!
Here it is!
I'll use the Intermediate Thread to soften the blow!
The Eighth Thread!
The Intermediate Thread!
You...
He's gone?
You've done it, Miss Tamayo!
I will never forgive you for this!
Tamayo?
Hey, Susamaru, that's a demon.
Isn't that Tamayo?
What a pleasant surprise.
Is that true?
Idiot!
Don't hit him!
This is so much fun!
This is so much fun!
I like you too, Mari.
Yahaba, can we take four heads with us?
No.
Let's take two.
A demon hunter and a retreat.
We don't need the others.
Nezuko.
The bloodstream doesn't stop.
Very slowly.
This medicine will help heal your leg.
What should I do?
I can't lose to him.
But even if I see an intermediate thread, it's not that easy to hit him.
Any technique will be useless if I don't strike accurately.
If I calculate, my techniques will not be so effective.
He starts to change the direction of the sword movement using arrows.
I don't like to say this, but these eyes in his hands are terrible.
It's very unpleasant.
These arrows are so fast.
And they won't disappear until they hit me.
And I can't cut them with a sword.
As soon as the blade touches them, it throws me in the direction of its movement.
What should I do?
Everything goes according to my plan.
Now I will turn your hands.
You avoided the attack by turning in the direction of the arrows, like Atsuo.
Damn it.
I can't stand his attack anymore.
I need to strike back.
I need to change the direction of the arrows and avoid contact with him.
Damn it.
It's time to die.
Adapt your techniques.
First, use the sixth style to collect arrows.
And then use the third style movement to direct them to him.
Rotate.
Collect.
Rotating cyclone.
Water flow.
My sword is so heavy.
But...
The second form.
Modification.
Horizontal water ring.
The second form.

To be continued...
Are you okay, Nezuko?
Today's secret taisho will be about these demons.
These two, Yahaba and Susamaru, met for the first time today.
I heard that they became friends, talking on the way here.
I can't even believe how well they work together.
But we won't let them beat us.
Nezuko, let's show them the teamwork.
The first style.
The second style.
The third style.
Great job, Nezuko.
Next, episode 10.
Together forever.
I'm leaving the girl with Temari to you.
Let's fight together.
