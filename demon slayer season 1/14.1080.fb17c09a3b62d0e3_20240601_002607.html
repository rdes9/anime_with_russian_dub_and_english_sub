I'll pierce you with this box!
Stop!
Freakish!
Take this!
Take this sword and fight, coward!
Episode 14
The House with the Herb of Glicinia
Stop!
He broke Kostya's bones!
Aren't you one of the demon hunters?
Don't you understand why Zenitsu doesn't get a sword?
It's all because we're not allowed to raise our own swords for no reason!
And you beat him up even though he didn't resist.
Do you like that?
Then you're just a pathetic snot!
Oh, so that's what's going on.
It's my fault.
Then let's fight hand-to-hand.
No, I don't think you understand anything.
First of all, we shouldn't fight each other.
We won't solve the problem hand-to-hand.
And you serve me!
Look at him!
How can he move like that?
Tanjiro's ribs are broken!
Looks like Tanjiro is breaking the law, too.
And he broke Kostya's ribs, too.
This guy...
He hits very low.
As if...
As if...
I'm fighting a wild beast!
The target is lower, lower...
Than your opponent!
The flexibility of his joints...
It's just incredible!
Cool, huh?
Isn't it cool?
I told you twice.
He can only boast.
Look what else I can do!
Stop it! Don't do that!
Don't do that when your bones are broken.
It'll only get worse.
Worse?
That's great!
Nothing can compare to this moment!
Think about your future!
What is it?
You need...
to calm down!
What's that sound?
Did you break your head?
Oh!
Ah!
Girl!
My face!
What the hell?
You don't like my face?
You're pretty scary, you know.
You have a muscular body, but a very feminine face.
What the hell are you staring at my face like that?
Nothing!
I'm not looking at your face!
I have no complaints about your face!
It's pretty neat, bright and attractive!
You're a coward!
Come here!
No!
I'm not going to fight you anymore!
Try to hit me with your head!
No, that's enough!
I said attack! Come on!
Calm down already!
You're fine!
Hey, you!
I'll give you my name!
Shibira Inosuke!
Remember it!
How do you write it?
Write? Write?
I don't know how to write or read!
This name is written on my pants!
What's going on?
He's frozen.
Something happened?
He fell! He's dead!
Dead!
He's not dead.
Maybe he's just fainted.
I hit him with my head with all my might.
Are you okay, Tanjirou?
Yeah.
That's amazing!
Can I touch your head?
You can.
That's scary!
Tanjirou has no blood on her head.
How much blood does she have?
Even the boar lost consciousness.
Tanjirou, is your head that strong?
Do you think so?
Brought to you by Anilibria.tv
Thank you for choosing us.
Tanjirou
He's awake!
Fight! Fight!
Hey, you!
He behaves the same way after waking up!
I hate it most of all!
What the hell are you doing?
This is a funeral.
You have to help too, Chinosuke.
There are still people who died in this house.
Why bury the remains of living organisms?
I'm not going to do it! I'm not going to help!
Forget it!
Fight me!
I'm not going to help!
I'm not going to help!
I'm not going to help!
Forget it!
Fight me!
God, he's really stupid.
How can you think it's pointless?
I see.
It's all because you have wounds, right?
You won't get your help.
They're both crazy.
No, it's okay.
Everyone has a different pain threshold.
You can't do anything here.
It's not easy to take the bodies of all the dead from the house and then bury them in the ground.
Zenitsu and these children do everything possible, so it's okay.
It's not about that.
I didn't mean that.
You can rest for now, Chinosuke.
I'm sorry for asking you so much.
Damn it, underestimate me!
I'll bury a hundred, no, two hundred of these corpses!
Look, I'll bury more people than any of you!
What is this guy doing?
Better not look.
Get down from the mountain!
Get down from the mountain!
The raven is talking.
Just don't think about it.
Okay.
Okay, follow me!
Follow me!
Hey!
Where are you going?
We're going down the mountain.
Our battle isn't over yet!
Aren't you tired already?
Let's go, we're going down.
I'm not tired!
Let's fight!
Let's fight!
Let's fight!
Let's fight!
Let's fight!
Let's fight!
Let's fight!
I don't want to!
I don't want to, I don't want to!
You can't leave, Shoichi!
You're strong, Shoichi!
Shoichi will be the one who will protect me!
Don't you see that Shoichi doesn't want to?
Please, don't leave me!
Stop it already!
Get your hands off me!
It's a demon repellent!
You, scoundrel!
Take it with you!
It smells like glycine.
Glycine?
Demons avoid its flowers.
You should protect it.
Demon repellent!
Demon repellent!
Thank you!
Thank you very much!
We can go home by ourselves.
Take care of yourself.
And now follow me!
Follow me!
Fight me!
I swear I'll find your weak spot and defeat you, loser!
My name is not loser, but Komado Tanjirou!
Komaboko Gonpachirou!
I'll defeat you!
What the hell are you talking about?
Of course I'm talking about you!
No, you're talking about someone else!
You can talk louder!
Glycine.
Glycine-like sign?
It's vacation time!
It's vacation time!
Since you're wounded, you should rest and recover your strength!
I'm sure we can rest.
I just fought a demon being wounded.
Ke-ke-ke, you say?
Let's eat him!
What?
Yes?
I'm sorry for bothering you.
Monster!
It's a monster!
Who are you?
I see you're a demon hunter.
You look weak.
Hey!
Come in.
This old lady walks fast.
You spend the night here.
Change of clothes.
And this is your dinner.
She's a monster, Tanjirou!
This old lady is a monster!
She moves so fast!
She's a monster!
Old lady is a monster!
Use the sticks.
Use the sticks.
If you're so hungry,
you can eat this.
Here.
No!
By the way,
he completely forgot about the boxes.
Get away from me, idiot!
You're a monster with eyelashes!
Your bed.
Here it is!
Old lady is a monster!
Who ate it,
I'll take care of it.
Okay.
You can sleep wherever you want.
Where do you want to sleep, Zenitsu?
Here's the doctor.
Hello.
Yeah.
Seriously.
Who would have thought that
all of us have broken ribs.
It's a bump.
It's a bump.
It's a bump.
It hurts more than the ribs.
I'm sorry.
It's better to apologize to you.
It really hurts.
How did you beat me up?
I'm sorry.
Ippos.
I'm sorry!
No!
Can you just say sorry?
If you behave like that,
we won't eat together.
And what's wrong with that?
What are you doing in the company?
The thing is...
Did you hit your head or what?
Well, yeah, who would say?
I can help you with something.
Monster!
Shut up!
Warren once said
that this house with the Glicenium sign
belongs to a family
that was once saved by demon hunters.
That's why
they take care of demon hunters for free.
That's what they told me.
But I couldn't imagine
that it would be so hospitable to us.
And how many of these demon hunters are there?
If you remembered about it, Inosuke,
why did you join the detachment?
Huh?
There's a reason for that, right?
The member of the detachment
of demon hunters
attacked me on my mountain.
We fought to find out who was stronger,
and I took his sword.
What a miserable soul.
And then I found out
what they call the final selection
and that demons exist.
That's why
you joined the demon hunters.
Listen,
it turns out
that we both grew up in the mountains, right?
Don't compare me with you!
I have neither parents nor brothers.
I enjoy
only measuring strength
with other creatures.
Really?
Really?
Seriously?
Tanjiro,
if no one asks,
I'll ask myself.
Why do you carry a demon with you?
What's that sound?
Zenitsu,
you knew about it
and you protected the box.
You're a very good person.
Thank you.
Huh?
You shouldn't have
spoiled me so much!
I have a very sharp smell.
I knew about it
from the very beginning.
You're so kind, Zenitsu.
And very strong.
No, I'm not strong.
Don't say that.
I haven't forgiven you
for not letting me take Shoichi with me.
He's trying to get out!
He's trying to get out!
How can everything be fine?
Quiet!
It's the middle of the night, Zenitsu!
Why didn't he
say anything?
Even when I took his food.
If you think like that,
why didn't he break down?
I forgot.
God, he wasn't even closed!
Protect me!
Please, protect me!
At least your socks!
Get away from me!
He's out!
He's out!
I need to hide. I'm so scared!
Huh?
Too many thoughts!
Zenitsu!
Nezuko is my...
Tanjirou!
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
Nezuko is my...
Tanjirou.
Listen.
Zenitsu?
Listen.
Who did you think you were?
You've been traveling all this time
with such a cutie?
You've been with such a cute
girl every other day
and you've been in the seventh heaven of happiness!
Zenitsu, it's not at all...
Give me back all the blood I've spilled for her!
I...
Listen, I...
I didn't try to make you enjoy
your life with this girl!
It wasn't for this reason that
this wild boar humiliated and beat me!
Zenitsu, calm down!
What did you find?
The hunters of demons
are joined not for fun!
People like you
need to be destroyed!
Immediately!
If you think you've committed a crime
by not letting me marry
and sending Shuichi home...
Destroy them immediately!
Don't underestimate
the hunters!
People like you!
People like you!
Zenitsu, stop it!
You damn hunters
of demons!
Go to hell!
Feel my wrath!
Zenitsu!
Zenitsu!
Zenitsu!
Zenitsu!
Zenitsu!

Mystery all about the datasets of the hunters of demons!
A new semester has begun!
Please introduce yourself!
I'm a six-year-old boy!
Take off those earrings!
My name is Hashibira Inosuke!
Put your shirt on.
My name is Zenitsu.
Put your hair in black.
But it's my natural color.
No excuses!
It's not fair!
It's forbidden to fill your mouth with bread.
