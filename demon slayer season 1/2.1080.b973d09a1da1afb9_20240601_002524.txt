I'm sorry, could you give me that basket of straw and a little bamboo?
Of course, you're welcome.
But there's a lot of holes in this basket.
It's okay, I'll pay.
No, you don't have to.
There's a lot of holes in the basket.
No, I'll pay you.
No, you don't have to.
You can also take the bamboo and straw for free.
But I'll pay anyway.
I told you to pay me.
I'll pay you.
I told you to pay me.
What a stubborn child!
That's not enough, but please take it.
Thank you so much.
Nezuko?
Huh? Nezuko?
She's gone.
So, where are you?
Tsuyoku nareru riyuu wo shitta

She's so gloomy.
It looks like she's really avoiding the sunlight.
Wait a minute.
Nezuko. Nezuko.
What do you think? Will you come in?
I'd like to go in the daytime.
I'll carry you.
Will you fit in?
Here.
The basket.
I can't fit in a little.
I can't believe you've grown up so much.
I think I was so tiny yesterday.
Nezuko, do you remember how you grew up to the size of an adult?
Can you do the opposite, shrink?
Smaller, Nezuko, even smaller.
Great. Nezuko is a good girl.
I'm shocked.
Mount Sagiri?
If you want to get to it, you have to cross this mountain, but...
I can't do it.
I can't do it.
I can't do it.
I can't do it.
I can't do it.
If you want to get to it, you have to cross this mountain, but...
The sun sets and you really go there with all this rain.
It's dangerous.
I'll be careful.
Thank you very much.
Be careful. People there have fainted!
Don't get lost.
Oh, there's a small temple here.
Judging by the light in the windows, there must be someone there.
Let's go in.
The smell of blood.
This mountain road is pretty dangerous. Someone could get hurt.
Are you okay?
What the hell?
This is my territory.
You'll pay if you get involved in it.
It's a demon-human!
You're so weird.
Are you both human?
The axe is not bad.
But such a scratch will heal in an instant.
See? The blood has stopped.
The blood has stopped.
The blood has stopped.
The blood has stopped.
The blood has stopped.
What?
He's so fast and incredibly strong.
You won't hit me twice.
Great. I'll break your neck.
I'll break your neck.
She killed him!
Wait, she's a demon, so...
Nezuko.
I can't believe it.
He just moved without a head.
Bastards!
You're demons after all.
That's where this weird feeling comes from.
Why do demons and humans travel together?
He also says so.
Stop!
Nezuko!
Nezuko!
Nezuko!
What's wrong with this guy?
He grew his hands out of his head.
I have to save Nezuko.
Get out of the way!
Strong as a stone.
And his head is like a stone.
No!
No!
Take this.
I shaved his hair,
and now it's time to catch him,
but they got tangled up.
Nezuko! Where are you?
Nezuko!
Enough!
Thank you for choosing us.
Nezuko!
It looks like there are a lot more demons here.
It's not the smell that was in our house.
It was another demon.
But...
I have to kill him,
or he'll attack other people.
So...
I have to do it.
Come on!
You can't kill him with this.
Masako Tengu?
I didn't hear his footsteps.
And how do I kill him?
Don't ask me.
You can think with your head,
to understand how.
If a knife strike is useless,
you have to break his head.
To cut his head open,
I think I'll have to hit him with this stone more than once.
He'll suffer.
Is there any way to kill him with one blow?
This kid can't handle it.
He's too kind and indecisive.
He looks at the demon,
but I can still smell the goodness.
He'll even feel the demon.
Giyo...
He'll never do that.
I don't feel anything.
So my body is dead.
It's a terrible feeling.
Bastard, I'll kill you!
I swear I'll eat you!
Come here, damn it!
I can't come to you.
Come to me!
Hey, do you hear me, kid?
I've been hesitating for too long.
The sun is rising.
He only burned out of the sun.
It's not surprising that Nezuko is avoiding him.
Nezuko?
Nezuko!
Nezuko...
Oh.
Right.
Where is that man?
He buried people killed by demons.
Um...
I'm Sakunji Urokodaki.
I believe you're the one who sent Tamioka Giyo to me.
Yes.
My name is Tanjiru Kamado.
My sister's name is Nezuko and...
Tanjiru.
What will you do if your sister is a human?
Too slow!
You're taking too slow a decision.
You couldn't finish that demon before the sunrise.
You know why you couldn't answer my question right away?
Because you lack decisiveness.
You have to do two things if your sister is a human.
Kill her and eat your stomach.
You have to understand this is a journey with your sister who became a demon.
But this should never happen.
And remember this as follows.
Your sister takes the life of an innocent person.
This should never happen.
Do you understand what I'm talking about?
Yes.
Good.
Then it's time to check if you can become a member of the demon killing squad.
Take your sister and follow me.
He's so fast.
How old is he?
And as before, I can't hear his steps at all.
Nezuko, you're probably shaking there terribly.
Hold on a little longer.
You had to go through so much.
Nezuko, all your life...
You're stuffing your kimono again.
I think you need to buy a new one.
No, no, it's not worth it.
This kimono is my favorite.
Let the brothers and sisters have more food so that they can eat.
I swear I'll turn you back into a human.
Someday I will definitely buy you a beautiful kimono.
I'll do everything I couldn't do for others.
I'll do everything for you.
Well, I passed the test.
It's just beginning.
We're going to climb this mountain.
I'll definitely take care of your sister instead of you.
I'm counting on you.
I'm so tired.
My legs are bending.
And my head is spinning.
Now you need to go down to my house at the foot of the mountain.
This time I won't wait for you.
I'll take care of you.
I'll take care of you.
I'll take care of you.
This time I won't wait for you until dawn.
And that's it?
Oh, I see.
He thinks I can get lost in such a fog.
I just need to get back to dawn.
It's simple.
I have a great smell.
I already remembered the smell of Mr. Urokodaki.
Ouch.
It's a rock.
Rocks?
A trap hole?
I see.
There are traps everywhere.
That's what I'm talking about!
Damn it!
Damn, damn, damn, damn!
If I get caught like this, I won't get out of the mountains until the morning.
Besides, here, on this mountain, the air is discharged.
It's much more discharged than on the mountain I lived on.
That's why it's so hard for me to breathe and my head is crumbling.
I'll be able to come back.
I'm going to faint right now.
No, I have to come back.
Control your breath and feel the smell of every trap.
That's it! I got it! I got it!
The traps set by humans have a slightly different smell.
But that doesn't mean...
I'm going to die!
I'm going to die!
I'm going to die!
But that doesn't mean...
...that I've become too reckless to avoid each of them.
I'm going to come back, no matter what it takes.
Nezuko!
I'm back!
I'm sorry for the suddenness, Mr. Sakonjiro Kadake.
I sent a young man to you who wants to become a swordman.
I'm sorry, but I'm not going to do it.
I'm sorry, but I'm not going to do it.
I'm sorry, but I'm not going to do it.
I'm sorry, but I'm not going to do it.
I sent a young man to you who wants to become a swordman, a demon killer.
He dared to fight me bare-handed.
His family was killed by a demon, and his surviving sister turned into a demon.
But I believe that she will not harm people.
I feel that there is something special in them.
The young man has an extremely sharp sense, as you do.
Perhaps he will be able to make a breakthrough and become your heir.
Please, teach him.
I understand that this is an egoistic request, but please forgive me.
I really hope that your efforts spent on his training will not go to waste.
Yours, Temeoka Giyo
I accept you as my disciple, Tanjirou Kamada.

God bless you all.
I have an idea...
Visit the temple.
You'll meet my friend.
A demon in a temple has surprised us quite long.
I did not expect him to haveuba.
Now, if I accept Mr. Urokodak.
Believe it or not, but he's already...
Tanjiro!
Yes?
What do you want for dinner?
Nikudyaku or Oden?
Well...
You're too slow!
I want Oden!
Next, episode 3!
Sabito and Makomo!
