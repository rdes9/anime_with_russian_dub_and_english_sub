Episode 6
The Swordman who accompanies the demons
Tanjirou
Now that you have become a member of the demon killer squad
I want to tell you something
Okay
The form of the demon killer that is now on you
It is made of fabric
This fabric is light, but it does not get wet and does not burn
The claws of the weak demons cannot even tear it apart
Is it so strong?
And your blade is not sharp
Its color depends on the owner, and each sword has unique properties
But due to the fact that the blades of black color are rare, they are little known
In fact, so little that...
So little known? What? What about the teacher Urokodaki?
They are so little known only because the swordsmen who own the black blades have not yet made a name for themselves
Of course, I do not know what I will do in the demon killer squad
But I will definitely turn Nezuko back into a human
Yes, you are right
I'm sure you'll do it
Yes
And one more
Take this
This is a box for carrying your sister during the day
It is made of a very light tree called a smokey stump
I covered it with stone ocher to strengthen the walls and increase its wear resistance
Thank you very much
He is so light, really light teacher Urokodaki
Nezuko, come here
Can you?
Nezuko
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
Nezuko, from now on we will always be together
Okay, I'll go
Wait
Nezuko, are you okay?
Nezuko?
It's just my guess, but I think Nezuko will recover
I think so
I think so
I think so
I think so
I think so
I think so
Nezuko recovers when she sleeps
Instead of eating human flesh
Nezuko, you need to rest
Is this the same city in the northwest?
Oh, look, it's Kazumi
Poor guy, he looks depressed
Because he was with Satoko when she was stolen
It's every night, what a nightmare
It's so terrible
They will steal another young girl at night
Mr. Kazumi
If you don't mind, I'd like to talk to you
May I?
Satoko is missing
You don't believe me, do you?
I believe you
Of course I believe you
I believe you
There's another girl
I know
There's still a weak demon smell
But it's insignificant
It's weird
Who is this kid?
What are you carrying?
What are you carrying?
What do you mean it's gone?
You bastard!
Darling, please stop
I want you to believe me
I want you to believe me
I want you to believe me
I want you to believe me
I want you to believe me
I want you to believe me
I want you to believe me
I want you to believe me
I want you to believe me
I want you to believe me
I want you to believe me
I want you to believe me
I want you to believe me
I want you to believe me
She really disappeared
I believe you
That's why I came here
Are you going to continue?
Yes
It's so late
I'm sorry that you're so worried about me
But can't we meet tomorrow after we rest?
These creatures are active during the night
So I have no time to rest
I smell a new scent in this area
It must be somewhere nearby
These creatures...
Just don't tell me you're really...
It's awful
I want you to be home at this time
Yes, mom
Good night
I want you to believe me
I want you to believe me
I want you to believe me
I want you to believe me
I want you to believe me
I want you to believe me
I want you to believe me
I want you to believe me
I want you to believe me
I want you to believe me
I want you to believe me
I want you to believe me
I want you to believe me
I want you to believe me
I wonder what happened to the kidnapped girls?
I hope everything is fine with them.
What happened to him all of a sudden?
So fast!
The smell is stronger! Demons appeared!
Demons!
He jumped! He was talking about demons!
A detachment to kill demons! He really is...
Here it is! They are right here!
Two different smells. A demon and a girl.
But they are nowhere to be seen.
But...
The point where the smell is the strongest is right here!
A demon-magic?
Demons who use special magic and the art of demonic blood are extremely strong.
From now on, you will have to fight with such demons.
Where are the girls you kidnapped?
And I have two more questions for you.
What was that?
Mr. Kazumi, please take her and be with me.
While you are in my reach, I can protect you.
From under the ground or from this wall, he can appear from anywhere.
There is also a possibility that he can emerge directly from the air.
But this demon, even when he is hiding, his smell does not disappear.
He is here! Water breath!
Fifth style!
There are three of them!
Calm down! You can do it!
Eighth style!
Water flow!
Tanjirou, listen to me carefully.
A demon whose blood can turn people into demons.
There is only one such demon in the world.
Only one?
The one who first turned into a demon more than a thousand years ago.
In other words, this is the enemy of your family.
Moreover, I am sure that he is the only one who can know how to turn your sister back into a human.
My name is Zero.
Eighth style! Water flow!
Too weak. My blow did not touch the vulnerable places of the demons.
Because I changed the style in the middle of the blow.
Everyone has the same smell.
I heard that demons usually do not work in groups.
That means one demon has split into three.
I will protect these two and kill these demons.
Do not lose your vigilance. I have to find out from this demon Okibutsuji Mutsanya
how to turn a demon back into a human.
Full concentration!
Water breath!
Second style!
Water ring!
Too weak again!
I can't follow him so far.
And I can't swing the sword while I'm protecting others.
Bastard!
Don't get under my feet!
Girl, you're going to die!
Damn it!
She's already 16, you know!
If I don't eat her in the near future, she won't be so delicious anymore!
Calm down, my double.
Hey, so what?
In such a night as this, I ate a lot of 16-year-old girls from this city.
They were all pretty and delicious.
I'm happy.
But I'm not happy, my double!
I want to eat even more!
You're a monster!
Give me back Satoko, the girl you kidnapped last night!
Satoko?
What are you talking about?
If her hairpin is in this collection, then I ate her.
Satoko!
Satoko!
Satoko!
Satoko!
Satoko!
Satoko!
Satoko!
Satoko!
Satoko!
Satoko!
Satoko!
Satoko!
Satoko!
He missed again!
He got under too quickly!
Wait, I'm too close to the wall!
Damn it! I was too close to the wall!
Why does an ordinary man carry a demon behind his back?
What does all this mean? Who are these two?
Do swordsmen and demons work together?
It can't be.
Maybe this will soothe you a little, but while you were sleeping on your tongue, I inspired her subconsciously.
Inspired?
All people are your family.
Protect people.
Demons are enemies!
Nezuko!
There is no forgiveness for the demon that has harmed people.
To be continued...
Your blows helped us!
Thank you!
It didn't break even from all those blows from the inside.
This box is very strong.
But isn't it tight in it?
Are you sure you're comfortable in it?
If you want, Brother can make a huge box for you!
And now it's time for the secret of Taisho!
I heard that today's demon sharpened his teeth while still being a human!
Next is episode 7!
Kibutsu Jimutsu!
