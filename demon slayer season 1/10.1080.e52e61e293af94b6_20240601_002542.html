Episode 10
Together forever
I did it!
Cyclone reception here is weaker than underwater!
But its impact was enhanced by the enemy attack.
I was able to use its arrows!
Damn it!
Damn it!
Damn it!
Damn it!
I should have just brought your head, and then I would have deserved his confession!
Never!
Never!
I will never forgive you!
Why do you throw me in the mud?
You will die with me!
Oh no!
He attacked me!
It attracts me with force!
More than his arrow had before!
In order to get out, I have to perform reception after reception!
Otherwise, it will just crush me!
Fourth style!
Wave strike!
The pressure on my body is increasing!
I can't swing the sword!
Use my techniques!
Not here!
I will not allow myself to lose!
Second style!
Water ring!
Waterfall flow!
Water slap!
Splashing drop of water!
Cyclone!
I have never done such a series of reception before!
It feels like my hands are about to tear off!
Not close enough!
More!
Sell even more!
How many more times?
How many?
Don't think about it!
Continue to perform reception!
Continue in the same spirit!
That's not all!
That's not enough!
Nezuko!
Miss Tamayo!
Yushiro!
My rib and leg are broken!
Bad news!
I'm too tired to hold the sword!
But I have to get there!
There's another demon!
I'll be back soon!
Soon!
I'll be back soon!
So hold on!
Please!
Hold on!
Unbelievable!
It's much easier for me to just avoid such direct attacks!
It's easier to track you down!
The same goes for you!
No matter how hard you try to hide,
I can see you through!
This is so much fun!
You!
Don't be so obvious just because you're immortal!
What's going on?
What are you doing?
She's attacking!
Just look at her,
Miss Tamayo!
Bastard!
Bastard!
So now you can beat my Tamayo?
How impudent!
Bastard!
Unbelievable!
Miss Tamayo, is that...
I used to use the sword
when I was a child,
but now it's gone!
It's gone!
It's gone!
It's gone!
It's gone!
It's gone!
It's gone!
I used an ordinary medicine,
nothing more.
Made specifically for demons.
It didn't make her stronger physically.
What we see is Nezuko's own power.
Without the use of human blood,
only her power.
Nezuko becomes stronger every second.
However, her opponent is also very strong.
If she shows all her strength,
Nezuko will have no chance.
I have to do something.
What an interesting girl!
This time I will attack with all my strength!
I wonder how long you can hold on.
I wonder how long you can hold on.
The girl is a demon of 12 moons.
Don't stand in the way!
Go back, damn traitor!
Just tell me one thing.
Do you know who Kibutsuji really is?
What are you talking about?
This man is no more than a coward.
He lives in constant fear.
Stop it!
Damn it!
Shut up!
Do you know why demons can't live together?
Why demons eat each other?
So that other demons do not unite
and do not attack him.
To do this, he manipulates demons
like you.
Shut up!
Shut up! Shut up!
Shut up!
He can't be so small!
Mrs. Tamayo,
a spell is being used.
His power is just incredible!
There is no one stronger than Mr. Kibutsuji!
You pronounced his name quite loudly.
This activates the curse.
The magic aroma of the White Day.
It weakens the functions of the brain of the goal.
A person cannot lie
and reveals all secrets.
You are very strong,
Mrs. Tamayo.
I'm very sorry for you, but
goodbye.
Please forgive me!
Please forgive me!
I beg you!
Please!
Please forgive me!

She just died?
She died instantly.
This is a curse.
She was destroyed by the Kibutsuji cells
that remained in her body.
In general,
clashes between demons are pointless.
They are useless
because they cannot kill each other.
Only the Sunlight
and the Hunter's Blade
can do this to demons.
Only Kibutsuji
can destroy the Kibutsuji cells.
Don't inhale the spell, Mrs. Tamayo!
It's harmful for humans!
Do you understand?
Tanjirou,
she
was not a demon of the Twelve Moon.
In the eyes
of the demons of the Twelve Moon,
numbers are carved,
but this demon does not have it.
Most likely,
another demon is not a demon of the Twelve Moon either.
They are too weak.
Too weak?
These two?
If Mrs. Tamayo says so,
there can be no mistake.
And yet, who knew
that there were such stupid demons?
She hurt Mrs. Tamayo
and got what she deserved.
I hope
this blood will serve as a basis
for the creation of medicine.
I'll take care of Nezuko
while I give her medicine.
She inhaled my spell.
I'm sorry.
Hey, you!
Don't move!
Now you're on your own!
I don't want to get away from Mrs. Tamayo!
Not for a second!
Mari...
Mari...
Mari...
Here's your Mari.
Play with me.
Play with me.
Play with me.
You're behaving like a little child.
Even though you
killed so many people.
Did I guess right?
Let's go.
You were made to think
that you were a demon of twelve bodies.
It was a lie.
Kibutsuji, you didn't stand a chance.
After you died, you didn't even have any bones left.
So, you're ready to die for the murder of other people.
Kibutsuji...
Is that how he pays those who admire him?
He's a real demon.
Miss Tamayo!
Yushiro!
Come here, come here!
It's not that I need you here.
But if you want, we're downstairs.
Yushiro.
I was just kidding.
Come down, Tanjiro.
Okay.
Nezuko!
I moved her to this basement,
where the sunlight won't reach her.
Nezuko?
How dare you!
Get away from Miss Tamayo!
That's rude!
Stop it, Yushiro.
I don't mind at all.
Stop it, Yushiro.
I don't mind at all.
Yes!
You have such a kind heart, Miss Tamayo.
You're so beautiful, I can't even believe it.
Stop it!
Nezuko has been behaving like this since the moment she woke up.
Do you think she's okay?
There's nothing to worry about.
She's okay.
Maybe she thinks
you're one of our family.
Stop it!
Family?
But I thought
Nezuko thinks all people are her family.
But Yushiro and I are demons.
Stop it!
But for some reason,
Nezuko treats you like people.
That's why she's trying to protect you.
I don't like
that Nezuko was instigated
against her will.
But it looks like she still has her will.
That's why...
I'm so sorry!
Nezuko!
Get away from her!
That's rude!
Thank you.
Nezuko.
Thank you.
Do you still want to live?
Do you want to live
despite the fact
that you're not a human?
If it goes on,
you'll most likely die.
However,
your life
will be full of difficulties
and suffering.
You...
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Do you
still want to live?
Yushiro and I will leave this region.
We're too close, Kibutsuji.
We need to hide as soon as possible
or the risk will be very high.
Besides,
even if I hide my identity,
when I contact people
as a doctor,
people sometimes recognize me as a demon.
Old people and children are very sensitive to this.
Tanjirou.
Yes?
Don't you want to
leave Nezuko with us?
I can't guarantee
that she'll be safe.
But she'll be safer with us
than with you on the battlefield.
Maybe that's right.
She's right.
It will be better
if they take care of Nezuko.
Miss Tamayo,
thank you very much for your offer.
But
Nezuko and I will stay together.
We won't be able to
live separately from each other.
Never again.
Okay.
In that case,
I wish you good luck in battle.
We'll leave
after we remove all traces.
So you two need to hurry up.
Okay.
Then I wish you both good luck.
Let's go, Nezuko.
Hey!
Don't be in such a hurry!
Tanjirou!
Your sister!
Beautiful!
South-South-East!
South-South-East!
South-South-East!
Next place in the South-East!
I hear you!
I hear you!
Let me rest and shut up!
I beg you!
I already heard your message!
Please!
Please, please, please!
Please, come out for me!
I can die any day!
Because I want you to come out for me!
Please!
Please!
I beg you!

Okay, last but not least...
Is this your first mission as a demon hunter?
Hey, we've been fighting since the very beginning!
