Episode 13
The most precious thing in life
Where are you, Tanjiro?
I can still hear this terrible sound. Just be careful, Tanjiro!
Um, Zenitsu, I think we're going in circles.
I knew it! I think so too! Well done, Shoichi! I knew you could make it!
Okay, can you check this room? Is it safe?
What the hell? Okay, okay, just don't look at me like that. Okay, I'll do it myself.
There's no one here. Let's go this way.
Tanjiro, please show yourself!
The room just turned upside down!
I can do it! I'm sure I can do it! I'll make it to the end!
Broken bones or not, it doesn't matter! I can do it! I can fight!
Show him how unwavering you are! Broken bones or not!
It's a bad thing! Nothing has changed!
The only thing left is strength and spirit to overcome him!
Use your head, not just your spirit!
Think, think, think!
It was close! I barely made it back!
Damn it! It's so annoying! I have to swallow more Marechi! I can't lose!
I don't even have time to think!
Hey, you! Your name!
Kyuugai!
Kyuugai! I won't give you Marechi! I won't back down! I won't give up!
Just give up!
I want to swallow some more Marechi and get back my place among the demons of 12 moons!
Just give up!
It's boring!
Everything you've written is so boring!
Everything to the last word is garbage!
It's not beautiful, it's not interesting, it's not impressive!
Maybe you'd better stop writing?
It's an empty waste of paper and ink!
Besides, you haven't been out for a long time, so it's not surprising that your work is so boring.
All you need is to enjoy the game on Tsuzumi while you're sitting here.
Although you won't be able to teach anyone this.
I'm going to kill you!
Get out of my sight, you damn insect!
Quick, quick!
Just don't tell me he can attack even faster!
My head is spinning from these twists!
This is bad!
Amazing technique!
And that's not all, because now he has five claws instead of three!
I got it!
I dodged the attack without stepping on the sheets, and now I understand how to breathe and move, so as not to cause myself pain!
Short and quick breaths, faster!
Thanks to this, I can strain the muscles around the broken leg.
And right before the attack with the claws, the smell of mold appears!
Here it is, the attack with the claws!
From the top!
From the left!
From the right!
From the back!
My head is spinning from all the attacks!
Full concentration!
Here's my breath!
Ninth attack!
Ninth style!
Water splash!
Whistle!
Reduce the time and area needed to land!
He adapted to changing rooms!
Forward!
Even closer!
At the distance of the blow!
Forward!
Right to his face!
I see the intermediate thread!
Pull!
Your demonic blood art is impressive!
The art of demonic blood is impressive!
I accidentally took a deep breath!
I'm the eldest son!
The eldest son!
Boy...
Tell me...
Do you really think that my demonic blood art was impressive?
It was amazing, but...
I can't forgive you for killing people.
I see.
Wait a minute.
We need to take a sample of the blood.
He took the blood!
He took the blood!
Is he really taking the blood?
It's only worth stabbing him!
Yoshiro is really a master,
since he created something like this.
A cat?
So you're the one who delivered it to Mrs. Tamaya?
Okay, okay.
Thank you.
Now everything is ready.
Okay, be careful.
Meow!
Thanks to Yoshiro's technique,
it was invisible until it meowed.
Then it disappeared again,
meowing for the second time.
Is that true?
Where are these two?
I have to find them!
My...
hand, piss!
It's so boring,
your pissanine.
Everything is trash until the last word.
It's not beautiful, it's not interesting,
it's not impressive.
It's not trash at all.
At least,
not for this guy.
He never stepped on them.
Rest in peace.
And my art of demonic blood,
and my game on Tsuzumi,
were recognized by them.
Thank you for choosing us.
Kiyoshi!
Teruko!
Kiyoshi!
Teruko!
Kiyoshi!
Teruko!
Tanjiro...
Why are you throwing things?
We are very sorry.
We are very sorry.
I see.
I'm glad you're all right and safe.
You were good here.
And you too, Kiyoshi.
Okay, let's get out of here.
Get on your back.
Is your leg okay?
Yes.
You need to hold on a little longer.
I smell Zenitsu and Shoichi.
They must be outside.
They are both safe.
The smell of blood.
Something happened.
It's okay.
Let's hurry.
Take this!
Get out of here!
Take this!
Take out the sword and fight!
You coward!
Tanjiro...
I...
I protected him.
I did it...
because you said
that he is much more important to you than your own life.
In fact, I...
I always had
very good hearing.
Sometimes
I hear what people say even when I sleep.
And it scares me a lot.
I don't hear the sounds of demons anymore.
Tanjiro, have you overcome that demon?
I hear you.
And some strange loud footsteps.
Zenitsu!
Zenitsu!
Thank God!
You're okay!
We were thrown outside
when the room turned upside down.
We fell out of the window of the second floor.
Really?
You protected me so that I'm okay, but...
I'm glad to hear that.
But why are you crying?
Huh?
I understand why!
Did I fall right on my head?
Yes.
Am I...
Am I going to die?
My head is spinning.
What is it? What is it? What is it?
Attack!
Attack!
It's him again!
The boar-monster!
I can feel the presence of the demon!
It's him!
I recognized him by his voice!
He's the fifth survivor!
During the final selection,
he was the first to rush to the top of the mountain,
and then came down from it before anyone else!
Break his head!
Hey, I found him!
Stop!
Who are you?
Get out of the way!
I'm Agatsuma Zenitsu!
I'm also a member of the hunting team for demons!
Hunting team for demons?
Should I tell you about it?
We have to get rid of this thing!
And now get out of the way!
I won't back down!
This is Tanji's box!
Don't argue with me!
Since you're so stubborn,
I'll destroy you and the box!
I said, get out of the way!
And why?
In the box?
In the box is what I won't let you touch with your finger!
Something very valuable for Tanjiro!
Come on!
What are you talking about?
There's a demon in this box!
Don't you understand?
I knew it from the very beginning!
I knew he was traveling with a demon.
The sounds of demons
don't sound like the sounds of people.
But...
But Tanjiro has such a gentle and kind sound
that I want to cry.
So gentle that I've never heard anything like it before.
All living creatures
make sounds all the time.
The world is filled with all these sounds.
Breathing, heartbeat,
sounds of blood flowing through veins.
If I listen,
I can understand what a person is thinking.
But people have been lying to me again and again.
And I've always trusted
those I wanted to trust.
Tanjiro is a hunter,
but he travels with a demon.
But I'm sure there's a reason for that.
And I can accept it.
I believe in it.
I...
I...
I'll ask Tanjiro personally!
So be kind.
Get the hell out of here!
Damn it, it's pissing me off!
You're pissing me off!
You can't even touch it with your finger!
It's a thing!
It's very important to Tanjiro!
You won't touch it until it comes back!
Damn it!
Take it!
Get out!
No!
Take it!
Get out!
Take it!
Take the sword and fight!
You coward!
Tanjiro...
I...
I protected it.
Because you said
that it's much more important to you...
...than your own life.
And after all this,
you won't even pull out your sword?
If you're a demon hunter too,
let's see how you fight!
If you won't fight,
then get out of the way!
Get out!
Get out!
Enough!
If you won't get out of my way,
I'll pierce you with this box!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Where are you going to take me√Å
Is this the demon's blood works?
The sky was spinning but he could attack.
Maybe the closer the demon is to Kibutsuji, the stronger and more problematic his art is.
Will I really be able to beat them?
And now it's time for the secret of Taisho!
Kyo-Gai is a demon from that house.
A fan of the legend of the eight samurais.
I heard that he writes his own biography.
Right, now is not the time to give up.
Next, episode 14, the house with the seal of Glicin.
Your brother will try!
I forgot about the broken bones.
