Nako, Kiyo, Sumi!
Please help me with the training.
If I interrupt the full concentration in my sleep, you can beat me with these punchers.
Please!
Okay.
Thank you very much.
Are you okay?
Mr. Tanger, well done!
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
Episode 25
Tsuguko, Tsuyuri's channel
I'm so weak.
Let's try again.
Okay.
Let's start.
Try, Sush.
This time it will work.
One more time, please!
One more Tanger today.
I'm sorry.
I asked them to come, but...
Well, it doesn't bother me.
Later, I'll ask them one more time.
I get used to supporting full concentration during training.
Although I can't do it all day, because it's too exhausting.
But the more I will support full concentration, the more I will be more patient!
You can do it!
I can catch her!
I can catch this girl!
I can catch her!
I can catch this girl!
I can catch her!
Thank you very much.
Zenitsu!
Inosuke!
I won't interfere.
You can do it!
You can do it!
You can do it!
You can do it!
You can do it!
You can do it!
She burst!
Now you have to burst a big pumpkin.
Yes, I did it!
Thank you all!
Damn it!
It seems that Tanjiro is already in training.
And now it's just bloomed.
Efforts are not our...
Daily work is very exhausting.
Oh, it's you!
Maybe I'm panicking because he left us behind.
But I didn't understand anything.
I didn't understand anything.
I didn't understand anything.
I didn't understand anything.
I didn't understand anything.
It was that he was trying to teach us.
Now I realize that we are completely hopeless.
Wait, you just said yes?
You're so cruel!
Would you really die if you said you're doing your best too?
You said train more.
I think there's no other way out.
Dirty!
Let's go, Monitsu!
Tanjiru is trying to master a technique called constant full concentration.
Supporting full concentration of breath throughout the day significantly increases endurance.
And you try.
Impossible! It's just impossible!
I still can't support full concentration all day, even though I try my best.
But I'm sure you can do it.
Do this and breathe deeper.
When you run out of blood, your bones and muscles will start, boom, boom!
You need to hold it.
All that's left is to train.
Yes, yes.
We're talking about basic technique, about beginner technique.
Don't you know how to do it?
But you'll have to put a lot of effort into it.
But, don't you know how to do it?
I'm sure it's easier for you than simple socks.
I'm sure you can't do it.
Even if there's no reason for it, you can't do anything if you can't do it.
Nothing, nothing, Shinki.
I can do it! Why not?
Don't joke with me, or I'll tear you to pieces!
Try your best, Zenitsu.
I'll support you more than anyone else.
Yes, ma'am!
Hanau, this is your group. Why don't you join them?
One more, one more!
Boom, boom! Come on!
Damn you!
Well done, Zenitsu! Come on!
The End
It hurts.
I'm hungry.
I'm sad.
It's hopeless.
I'm suffering, I'm lonely, this is my life.
But one day I heard something like a click.
And I never felt pain again.
Thank you for choosing us.
I never felt pain again.
Even living in poverty.
Even when my parents sold me, it didn't upset me.
Excuse me, can I talk to you for a minute?
Tell me, why is this child tied up?
I think she's a criminal.
Don't you see? She's got a bad face, and her face is all dirty.
Besides, she can escape.
Hello, nice to meet you.
My name is Kochi Kanaye.
And you?
She has no name, is that clear?
Her parents didn't give her a name.
Are you happy? Get away from her.
Please don't touch my sister.
What do you two want?
If you want to talk to her, pay.
Okay, then we'll buy her.
Is that enough?
Hey, come back!
I would have picked them up in your place.
After all, the wind is strong here.
Are you sure?
I'm sure.
Please, forgive me.
Hands off, it's all mine.
Oh my God.
Oh my God.
Sister, sister.
This child is hopeless.
She doesn't do anything, until you tell me.
She won't even touch the food until I tell her, even if she burps in her stomach.
Oh my God, and what are we going to do with her?
Nono, don't say that. I like your smile so much, Koshinova.
But we can't do anything to a child who doesn't even think about herself, it's dangerous.
Well, you're right, Nono.
She's not independent, she doesn't make decisions.
When you're alone, you can decide anything by throwing a coin.
Okay, Kanao?
Sister!
Don't take everything so seriously.
Since Kanao is so cute, give yourself a reason.
If you give a person a chance, he will open your soul, so don't worry.
If you fall in love with a guy one day, you will also change, Kanao.
Well done! Now continue!
Now stronger! Bam! Like this!
You can do it! Come on! Great!
Come on, well done!
Inosuke! Inosuke!
Inosuke! Inosuke!
Our new swords of Nichiren will be brought to us soon!
Really?
Yes! Boran just told me!
This is the smell of Mr. Haganezuki!
Hurray!
Let's go! Let's go!
Mr. Haganezuki! Hey! Hey!
Mr. Haganezuki!
Long time no see!
How are you doing?
Mr. Haganezuki!
How dare you break my sword!
Damn it!
Forgive me, but to be honest, I was on the verge of death.
My opponent was very strong.
Lies do not change the essence of the matter.
It's your fault! It's your fault!
You are terribly weak! That's why he broke!
Otherwise, my sword would never break!
But I...
I'll kill you!
Is this a new kind of training?
I don't think so.
Well, Mr. Haganezuki is a very strange person.
I understand.
He loves his swords the most in the world.
Even in the homeland of blacksmiths, there is no one like him.
Perhaps you are right.
My name is Kanamori.
I forged swords for Mr. Haganezuki.
I will be happy if they are useful to him in battle.
They are beautiful.
Great blue-gray glow.
Good color for the blade.
I'm glad for you, Inosuke.
After all, your swords were so sharp.
How do you like the handle?
I made blades for the first time for someone who uses two swords at once.
Mr. Inosuke.
Fire!
That's better.
I'll kill you, stupid snot!
Bastard, are you kidding me?
Bastard, you're a dead man!
Unbelievable!
He's amazing!
It's amazing to hit stones with these swords!
It seems to be all right.
Mr. Tanjiro will do his best.
Let's make him anigiri.
Yes.
My body has changed.
I want to swing with my blade.
With my own hands!
Yes, I did it!
Good.
You can do it.
You can't relax.
I can do it!
I did it!
Go!
It's easy.
I can do it!
I can do it!
Go!
This medicine stinks.
The group will give it to them.
He won!
It's considered a victory!
It's still a victory!
Yes!
I did it!
Yes!
Open your mouth.
Excellent.
Your jaw is like new.
Good.
You can close your mouth.
This is the end of the examination.
Since you are completely healthy,
you can safely complete the task.
So my training is over?
Yes.
It remains only to test yourself in battle.
Yes!
Oh, I haven't forgotten Mrs. Shinobu yet.
I would like to ask you something.
What is it?
Have you ever heard of the dance of Hinokami Kakura?
No.
Then what about the breath of fire?
I haven't heard of it.
Actually, something happened to me in childhood.
I see.
For some reason, Tanjirou,
you used the breath of fire of your father.
I can only say that there is a breath of fire,
but not a breath of fire.
What?
Isn't that the same thing?
I don't know the details.
I'm sorry.
But I know that there are strict rules
regarding the names.
The breath of fire cannot be called the breath of fire.
The hash of the Rengoku flame
should be something known,
but unfortunately it is now on the task.
I understand you.
Thank you for everything you have taught me.
I will ask Mr. Rengoku if I see him.
Yes.
Then I'm sorry.
Kamada.
Yes?
I expect great achievements from you.
Okay!
Did she sleep all day again today?
I was told that in a dream you can restore your strength,
but I'm worried if you don't open your eyes for a moment.
Your brother will leave this place soon
and go to school.
Your brother will leave this place soon
and go to school.
I'm completely healthy
and I've gotten a little stronger,
and I've been keeping my full concentration.
I think Zenitsu and Inosuke will be with me too.
I feel full confidence when these two are together.
I see.
You think so too, Nezuko.
They are good guys.
In order to turn you back into a human,
I will defeat the strongest demons
and send their blood to Mrs. Tamae.
But am I capable of that?
I know you can do it, brother.
Thank you, Nezuko.
You encouraged me a lot.
I will try my best.
Thank you, Nezuko.
Thank you, Nezuko.
Thank you, Nezuko.
Thank you, Nezuko.
Thank you, Nezuko.
Thank you, Nezuko.

Thank you, Nezuko.
Thank you, Nezuko.
Thank you, Nezuko.
Thank you, Nezuko.
Thank you, Nezuko.
Thank you, Nezuko.
Thank you, Nezuko.
Thank you, Nezuko.
Thank you, Nezuko.
Thank you.
Thank you, Nezuko.
Thank you, Nezuko.
Thank you, Nezuko.
Thank you, Nezuko.
Thank you, Nezuko.
Thank you, Nezuko.
Thank you, Nezuko.
Thank you, Nezuko.
Thank you, Nezuko.
Thank you, Nezuko.
It's too hard to keep a full concentration.
Damn, I can't do anything.
I see you're very tired for today.
I know.
It's time for the secret of Taisho.
The medicine that was in the reaction training and added to the bath
perfectly heals wounds and relieves fatigue.
Well, I'm going to the training.
And you should rest.
Well, I'm going to the training.
And you should rest.
And you should rest.
Well, I'm going to the training.
And you should rest.
I still got it!
Don't underestimate me!
We're still training.
Great! We just need to prove ourselves!
Next, episode 26.
New task.
Okay, I'm going, Nezuko.
