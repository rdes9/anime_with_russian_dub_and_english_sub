Episode 8
The smell of magic blood.
What is it? What's going on?
No!
Stop it!
Dear!
Lady!
You'd better worry about yourself.
Please take the cloth and stretch your wound.
It's all right.
Maybe everything will be all right.
His wife's wound is immortal.
Stronger!
Stronger!
Tie her up with a rope!
It's all right.
This man didn't kill anyone.
Just a second ago,
this man was just walking down this street.
Everything's fine.
You don't have to look at it.
It's all right.
You don't have to look at it.
It's all right.
You don't have to look at it.
It's dangerous here, Ray.
Let's get out of here.
Where to?
Damn!
Damn!
I can't just leave him here.
Thank you, Tsuchimu-chan.
I won't let you hide.
And it doesn't matter where you run.
What's wrong with this kid?
What do you think, Tsukihiko?
I don't care if you don't hide.
I'll follow you to hell
and I swear I'll cut off your head with my blade.
I'll never forgive you.
Hey!
What the hell are you doing?
Is he drunk?
Man, get away from this man.
I can't.
Please, untie him.
Please.
Shut up and get away.
Please, don't.
Only I can hold him down.
Get away.
Please, don't do this.
Just look at his face.
Is he crazy?
Take this guy away from him.
Stop it.
I don't want this man to kill someone.
Just stay away.
I beg you.
Damn.
Just look.
If you continue to resist.
The magic blood.
The scent of vision.
What is this smell?
What are these patterns?
What's going on?
I don't see anything.
Is this something like an attack?
If so, I have a problem.
The smell is getting stronger.
Are you still calling him a man?
Even though he turned into a demon
and you're trying to save him?
Then let me help you.
But why?
You're...
Judging by the smell...
That's right.
I'm...
a demon, but also a doctor.
I want to destroy that man, Gibutsuji.
Will you come with us, Dad?
Dad has work.
I have things to do at work.
And I'm worried about this mess on the street.
Darling.
Don't worry.
I'll just talk to the police.
Come on, get in.
Dad, come back soon.
Okay.
And you be a good girl.
Take them home.
Go.
Bro, let's get another bar.
I'm drunk.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm okay.
I'm okay.
I'm not drunk at all.
What the hell, you bastard?
I'm sorry.
Hey, come here.
I'm sorry, but I have to go.
I'm sorry.
Hey, come here.
I'm sorry, but I have to go.
I'm sorry, but I have to go.
What did you say?
Just look at yourself.
You're dressed up.
You're pissing me off.
You're a good girl.
It feels like you're dead.
Hey, say something.
Or you can only poop.
Ya-chan.
What did you do to my brother?
Ya-chan, he's dead.
Ya-chan doesn't breathe.
Bastard.
My complexion.
Do you think I'm unhealthy, too?
Or maybe my face is too pale?
You think I'm sick.
I look like I won't live long.
Like I'm on the verge of death.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
I'm a living creature close to perfection.
What do you think will happen if I keep on pouring your blood?
The human body is unable to withstand the speed of transformation.
And its cells are dying.
Bring me the head of the Demon Killer.
What does Sergei Hanafuda wear?
Understood?
Yes, sir.
Your wish is my command.
These are Sergei.
Thank you for choosing us.
Listen to me, that's the thing.
That's the thing.
We don't even talk about money.
But I'll never forgive you
if you don't eat my udon.
Excuse me.
Please bring another one.
Will you eat it?
Yes.
Will you eat it for sure?
Of course.
Okay.
You too.
If you're going to eat udon, get rid of this thing.
And what is it?
Take these sticks, sticks.
I'd like a plate of udon.
Even two plates of udon.
Okay.
Thank you very much for the food.
It was very delicious.
I'm glad you liked it.
It's always delicious.
Thank you.
I'm sorry, Nezuko.
I left you alone and...
What's the matter, Nezuko?
Oh,
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Oh.
Were you waiting for us all this time?
Because I was ordered to bring you to her.
I could track you by smell.
The place where she is is hidden with the help of a spell.
You couldn't find it.
Hidden?
Whatever.
Isn't this girl a demon?
What kind of demon is she?
Demon?
Demon?
Does it mean ugly?
Who?
Nezuko?
You dared to call her a demon?
Maybe you'll take a closer look at her?
In our city, everyone said that Nezuko is a beauty.
Let's go.
Of course we'll go, but still,
she just can't be undressed.
Look at her when we go out into the world.
Hey, you.
Come here.
Oh, I know.
It's all because of this thing, right?
It must be because of her.
I'll get her out.
And you'll rate Nezuko for her dignity.
Hurry up until no one sees you.
There's a whole house behind the wall.
Kiga!
Come here.
Listen.
In no way do I insult this man.
Personally, I don't care what happens to you.
But I brought you here because she's a demon.
Okay.
Come in.
I'm back.
Welcome back.
I'm sorry I left her for you.
How's the girl?
She's fine.
Unfortunately, I was forced to lock her husband in the basement.
Isn't it hard for you to take care of people's wounds?
That's ridiculous.
Do you think demons swallow the smell of blood
when they treat people?
I'm sorry.
Stop it.
Why do you have to resort to violence?
I didn't introduce myself.
My name is Tamayo.
This guy is Yoshiro.
I hope you'll be friends.
I don't think it's possible.
But it's not hard at all.
I'm sure I'm luckier than a regular demon
because I adapted to my body.
And I got rid of the curse of Kibutsuji.
Curse?
You adapted to your body?
Come with me.
Hey, Inesuko!
You're ugly!
It's okay.
You look like you're home.
I'm sorry.
Now let me continue.
I changed our bodies.
And we can live without eating people.
Enough human blood.
Blood?
You mean...
It'll probably upset you.
But we buy blood for blood transfusion
from those who can't bring an end to an end.
Of course, it won't hurt people's health.
I see.
That's why I didn't feel the smell of all the demons from these two.
But they still need human blood.
If they only need blood, then Inesuko...
Yoshiro needs just a little bit of blood.
I turned him into a demon.
You did it?
But...
What?
Absolutely right.
In addition to Kibutsuji,
he can't create new demons.
That's more or less right.
After two hundred years,
I was the only one who could turn Yoshiro into a demon.
Two...
Two hundred years?
You're the only one who could turn Yoshiro into a demon
in the last two hundred years?
How old are you, Mrs. Tamayo?
You can't ask a woman about her age like that, grubyan!
Yoshiro, you'll regret it if you hit him again.
Yes!
She's beautiful, even when she's angry.
I don't want you to misunderstand me.
I'm not trying to increase the population of demons.
I'm doing this procedure only on incurable patients
or on those who are mortally wounded and will not live long.
And in this case,
I always ask if they want to live forever being demons.
The smell that comes out of her is pure,
it is devoid of deception.
She is the one who can be trusted.
Mrs. Tamayo,
is there a way to turn a demon back into a human?
Do you see something?
I see.
I see traces.
Here they are, here they are.
Here they turned sharply.
There are three of them.
One of them carries a big box.
I wonder how we would kill him.
I feel how the power flows through my veins
because I got his blood.
Of course we will kill him as cruelly as possible.
There is a way to turn a demon back into a human.
Tell me how!
How dare you come so close to Mrs. Tamayo!
Yushiro.
Yes, ma'am, I just threw him away.
Mrs. Tamayo, I didn't beat him.
Don't do anything else.
Yes!
Please tell me how.
For any wound there is a medicine or a way of treatment
until I can turn a demon back into a human.
But I'm sure it's possible.
However, we are trying our best to develop a way of treating this.
That's why I wanted you to do something for me.
In order to create such a medicine, you need to study a huge amount of blood of demons.
I have two requests for you.
First, permission to study the blood of your sister.
Second, collect samples of the blood of demons
closest to Kibutsuji.
The current state of Nezuko is an incredibly rare and unique case.
I understand that she has been sleeping for two years in a row
and I am sure that her body has changed over time.
Usually, a demon who has been eating flesh for so long
and does not drink the blood of people or animals
will definitely get angry.
Mrs. Tamayo is beautiful today.
I'm sure she will be the same tomorrow.
And yet, it's amazing that Nezuko has no signs of this.
This miracle will be the key to solving this mystery.
My second request is pretty cruel.
Under the demons close to Kibutsuji, I meant demons
whose strength corresponds to the very strength of Kibutsuji.
It's not an easy task to get the blood of such demons.
So, are you ready to fulfill my request?
If there are no other options, I agree.
If you need to study the blood of all these demons
to create a cure,
if everything goes well, it's not just about Nezuko.
Many people's lives will be saved, right?
Right now.
Get down!
You've already decided how to kill him?
Of course! Cruel!

To be continued...
Today I will start with the secret of Taisho.
Yushiro makes notes about Mrs. Tamayo in the diary.
I heard that he writes 7-10 pages a day.
And so I found this diary. Let's take a look.
So, so.
January 10.
Mrs. Tamayo is again unearthly and beautiful today.
At 17.10, she called me by name,
no less than twice.
She has a beautiful voice.
At 17.29, when Mrs. Tamayo,
thinking, slipped on the steps...
