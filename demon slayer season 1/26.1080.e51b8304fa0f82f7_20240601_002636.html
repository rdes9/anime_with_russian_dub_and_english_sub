        <pre>You're so fast, Kano!
Now you've got 10 wins and 10 losses on your scoreboard.
I'm not done yet.
Let's run.
You're not against it?
I'm not against it.
I'm not against it.
I'm not against it.
I'm not against it.
I'm not against it.
I'm not against it.
I'm not against it.
I'm not against it.
You're not against it?
With the support of constant full concentration?
Yes!
Support her all the time!
Manger!
Take it!
It's nothing!
You need to have the strength and the mind.
Let's go!
Episode 26
New mission
Several months ago
New mission
What kind of place is this?
Is this the art of the demonic blood of that girl?
It seems as if all the space around her is distorted.
This is amazing.
12 moons.
He's never been here before.
The fifth Nishiluna is not here yet.
She moved!
It's the new art of demonic blood!
What's wrong with that woman?
Who is she?
Bow your head and bow.
Bow your head.
It's Mr. Muzan.
It's the voice of Mr. Muzan.
I recognized him.
He changed the appearance of the aura.
The accuracy of his transformation is incredible.
Please forgive us,
because you had a different type of aura.
Who allowed you to speak?
Don't open your mouth when you're thinking.
Answer my questions and that's it.
Rui was killed.
I'm talking about the fifth Nishiluna.
But I have one question for you.
Why are the demons of the Nishiluna so weak?
If you have become part of the twelve moons,
you shouldn't stop there.
It's just the beginning.
The more people you eat, the stronger you are.
The more useful you become for me.
For more than a hundred years,
the composition of the Nishiluna remains unchanged.
The Nishiluna have always been the ones
who killed hushers and hunters for demons.
But what about you, demons of the Nishiluna?
It's easy for you to talk about it, but we...
It's easy for you to talk about it, but we...
We what?
Come on, say it.
He can read minds.
Damn it!
Something's wrong.
Say it.
Please, forgive me, Mr. Kibutsuji!
Please!
Show mercy!
I'm sorry!
I'm very sorry! Very!
Why did it happen?
Am I going to be killed?
After all I've been through to become a member of the twelve moons?
But why? Why?
From this moment on, I have to try harder and harder.
Are you afraid of hunters for demons more than me?
No!
Every time you meet a husher,
you always want to run away.
No, I don't think so.
I'll sacrifice my life for you.
You're denying my words.
Bad news.
This is the end.
Our thoughts will be read.
Even if you agree, even if you deny it,
he'll still kill us.
We can't even defeat him.
In that case...
All we have to do is run!
What a fool!
We have to get out of here somehow!
Get out of here!
Since I've come so far!
I think it's better to consist of twelve moons only from above.
Did you catch me?
It can't be!
It's all because of that girl's beer!
No!
I didn't hear a single sound of beer!
Why?
I can't even restore my body!
In the end, what do you say?
I can be useful to you!
If you make me a little delay, I'll prove to you that...
How long will the delay be?
And how can you be useful to me?
What are you capable of with your current strength?
Your blood!
If you give me a little more of your blood...
If you give me a little more of your blood...
I will definitely take it!
I will become stronger and I will fight for you!
Why should I give you blood according to your order?
What a pig!
Know your place!
You're wrong!
You're wrong!
I'm just...
Shut up.
I'm not wrong.
I never make mistakes.
I have the right to decide.
My words are not subject to doubt.
You have no right to reject my words.
What I call right is right.
You tried to tell me what to do.
You deserve to die.
What are your last words?
He will be killed too, then.
It all depends on the mood of the gentleman.
And I will die soon too.
Well, let's see.
It feels like I'm in a dream.
To die from your hands.
It's great to hear the pre-death screams of other demons.
It's great!
Since I like to look at the pain and suffering of people,
it feels like a dream to me.
Thank you for leaving me in the end.
I'm glad to hear that.
I'll give you a little of my blood.
You can't stand the amount of blood and die.
But if you can accept it and gain even more strength,
be useful to me.
Kill the hushers of the hunters for the demons.
If you kill the hunter who wears the fur coat of Hinafuda,
I'll give you even more of my blood.
What is it?
I see something.
It flows into me along with the blood of Mr. Muzan.
If I kill the husher and this child, I'll get more blood.
It's like a dream.
It's already morning! Wake up!
What the hell?
What's going on?
There are missing people in the endless train.
There are more than 40 people missing.
Join Rengoku Kyojiru!
Go to the West!
I decided to send Tanjiru and the others on a mission in the endless train.
I can find out why you recommended Tanjiru to me, Shinobu.
Tanjiru is pure-hearted and very hardworking.
And his willpower that he showed exceeded my expectations.
And by the way, he clearly knows his goal.
To defeat Kibutsuji.
To be honest, I absolutely agree with you.
And Tanjiru told me that his father used the breath of fire.
How so?
Without a doubt, he still has to go a long way.
But maybe Rengoku Hoshiro Flamingo will be able to clarify the situation.
That's right.
Considering that his sister eats people, even being a demon,
and his meeting with Kibutsuji,
it could be Tanjiru's destiny.
Great! It's time to go!
Oh, it looks like someone's coming.
He hit me, even though I went away.
Oh, that guy.
He was at the final selection.
He moved so fast in such a short time.
I wonder why his smell...
Long time no see! I'm glad you're okay!
So, are you leaving already?
It was nice to spend this time with you.
Good luck.
Be careful.
Thank you for taking care of us, even though I was busy.
Thanks to you, we can get back on track.
You're welcome.
After all, I was lucky to survive the final selection.
And I was afraid to participate in the battles.
I'm a coward.
It doesn't matter at all.
You've already become a part of me,
because Aoi helped me.
And these feelings will go to battle with me.
Okay, watch me if I get hurt again.
Oh, there you are!
Kanao!
We're leaving already.
Thank you for everything.
What's that?
I was just following the teacher's orders.
There's nothing to thank me for.
Bye.
You talked to me!
What did you just throw at me?
Bye.
A coin?
Is it written Heads and Tails?
Why did you throw it at me?
Bye.
It flipped over many times.
I throw it at you every time I'm not given orders.
I just decided whether to talk to you or not.
Not Heads, but Tails.
Tails fell out.
Bye.
Why don't you decide for yourself?
What do you want to do, Kanao?
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.
That's why I can't decide for myself.
I don't think anything in this world matters.
I think you have a quiet voice in your heart.
Of course, it's important to follow orders, but...
Oh!
I owe her for a while.
Yes.
Thank you.
Great!
Let's decide it with a throw.
Decide what?
One way or another.
From now on, you will listen to the voice of your heart.
Oh!
I threw it too high!
Heads!
Let the Heads fall out!
If the Heads fall out, Kanao, you will listen to your heart.
Oh!
Where did it go?
Oh, it's her!
I caught it!
I caught it, Kanao!
Are you ready, Kanao?
Which side?
Because of his back, I didn't see the moment when she fell.
Heads!
Kanao!
Good luck!
People live by the order of the heart.
So your heart will definitely become even stronger.
Okay, see you later.
Why did she fall with the Heads?
I saw his hand during the throw.
I don't think he was cheating.
It's a coincidence.
Well, if the Heads fell out, I would have thrown it until then.
Until the Heads fell out.
Good luck!
You can do it! You can do it! You can do it!
Hooray!
Here you go.
Thank you.
We don't have time.
Please go and kill a bunch of demons.
We'll try.
I told you we don't have time!
Shut up! Stop eating! I'm sick of it!
Mr. Tomioka!
Are you going to the battle?
Yes.
I heard that you have a constant full concentration.
Yes.
Continue in the same spirit.
Yes.
Mr. Tomioka.
About Nezuko.
Thank you very much.
I didn't even realize that your life was over.
I don't even know how to thank you.
You can thank me with good service.
Our task as hunters is to kill demons.
That's all.
Right!
Take care of yourself.
It's so hard for you to say goodbye to me, isn't it?
If you want, I can stay.
Teacher Zenitsu, please.
Learn to be with your wife and girls.
Okay.
I understand.
Are you a little sad because I'm leaving?
We're not sad.
Okay, guys.
It's time for us to go.
Hey! Hey! Hey!
What?
What?
What kind of creature is this?
Yes, I'm sure it's him!
The ruler of these lands!
The ruler of these lands!
See how long it is?
It's so scary!
It looks like he's asleep, but don't lose your vigilance!
It's just a train. Have you seen anything like that?
Quiet! Don't make a noise!
I'm taking the first blow.
Wait, you and your socks!
You didn't think it could be the guardian spirit of these lands?
Besides, you can't get into a fight without a reason.
Hey, didn't you hear me? It's a train.
It's just a train, got it?
It's a car for transporting people.
What a villager.
A train?
Is that what the villager was talking about?
What's the problem?
Attack!
Stop it! You're embarrassing us!
What are you doing? Hey, you!
Hey, these guys have swords!
Police! Call the police!
Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!
Run!
We went through hell because of you and your socks!
I'm sorry!
First of all, why should we run to the police?
We, the demon hunters, are officially unrecognized by the government.
We can't walk with our swords in broad daylight.
They won't believe us.
Even if we tell them about the demons, it will only confuse them.
Despite the fact that we work so hard?
You can't do anything.
From now on, we will carry swords on our backs.
You can still see them. Put on something stupid.
Damn it! The train is moving!
Is the police still here?
We have to go even if they are here.
I'll kill you, master of these seeds!
Hey, stupid!
It's time for us too.
Hey, you three!
Danger! And the socks!
Zinnitsa!
And he's fast!
Tanjiru.
Are you sure you should take Nezuko with you?
Isn't the headquarters of the hunters' apartment the safest place for her?
No.
Everything is fine.
Wherever we go, Nezuko and I will always be together.
We...
We will never leave each other.
...heal them.
I'll save you, whatever it costs.
I promise my elder brother will save you!
Kibutsu Jamuzan!
I won't let you go!
And it doesn't matter where you run!
Nezuko and I will always be together.
We won't be able to live without each other.
The connection between me and Nezuko...
...won't be broken!
Nezuko...
...I swear!
