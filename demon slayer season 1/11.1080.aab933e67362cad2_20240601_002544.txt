South-South-East!
The next place is in the South-East!
I can hear you!
I can hear you!
Let me rest and be silent!
I beg you!
I've already heard your message!
Please!
Please, please, please!
Please come out for me!
I can die any day!
That's why I want you to come out for me!
Please!
Please, please, please!
What's wrong with him?
What the hell?
What's wrong with him?
What's wrong with him?
What's wrong with him?

Come out as many times as you like!
We are everywhere in the world!
We don't know what the trouble is.
A little flower of regret
The eleventh episodeâ€¦
vineyard in Tsuzumi
I beg you! I don't have anyone! You're all I have!
I see. I'll think of something.
Please help me! Please come out for me! I beg you!
What are you doing here in the middle of the road?
Don't you see that she doesn't need you? And don't give your thief problems!
This is Forma! This is the guy from the final selection!
I don't know you! I don't know you!
But we met! Remember? Remember?
Yes, you clearly have memory problems!
Okay, I'll take care of him. Go home and don't worry.
Okay, thank you very much.
Hey! Get out of the way! This girl has to come out for me!
Because she loves me! Because...
Hey, it hurts! Stop it! Stop it!
Hey, calm down!
When did I say I love you?
You were sitting on the edge of the road and looked sick, and I just talked to you!
Doesn't it mean that you talked to me because you're worried and because you love me?
Actually, I already have a fiance, so not in this life!
Apparently, you're okay if you're so cheerful. Goodbye!
Wait, come back! Come back!
Hey, enough already!
Why did you stop me? I didn't do anything to you!
What kind of facial expression is that? Stop it!
Why are you looking at me like at an animal?
Hey, you! You answer for this!
It's your fault that I didn't get married!
Say something!
Listen, I'm going to die soon!
On the next mission!
The thing is that I'm terribly weak!
I'm not kidding! You have to protect me until I get married!
My name is Komado Tanchero!
Tanchero!
I'm sorry! I'm Zennitsa Gatsuma! Please save me, Tanchero!
What do you mean?
Why did you decide to become a swordsman, Zennitsa?
And why are you so shameless?
It was too rude!
A woman cheated on me and I got a bunch of debts!
And the old monster who killed them was a teacher!
I trained day after day!
It was so terrible that I wanted to die!
I hoped that I would die during the final selection!
But since I was lucky enough to survive, I'm suffering to this day!
I'm so scared, scared, scared, scared!
I'm definitely going to be killed and eaten by a demon!
It will suck my brain through my ears and I will still be alive!
No! No!
Please, protect me!
What's wrong? Are you okay?
Argh!
How are you?
Better. I think I calmed down, but I'm hungry.
Did you bring any food with you?
No.
Here, take this. Want some?
Oh, thank you.
Aren't you going to eat the tangerine?
No, it's all I have.
Here, eat half.
Are you sure?
Thank you!
Mmm!
I know what it's like when you're scared of demons,
but don't give your sparrow any trouble.
Trouble?
Sparrow?
How do you know?
Well, he says you're constantly whining that you don't want to go to work.
You drag yourself after any girl and you whine very loudly.
That's what he says.
Is that what he says?
Do you understand the language of birds?
You're lying! You're trying to stab me!
Hurry up! Hurry up!
Tangerine! Run!
Go to the next place!
Run! Run! Tangerine!
This sparrow is talking!
Hey, Tangerine, if you think about it, I can't handle it.
Even with you, I'll be absolutely useless.
The demon's smell is getting stronger.
There's something ahead.
What's that?
I smell blood.
But this smell...
Did you smell something?
Something I've never felt before.
I don't know about that, but do you hear that?
And don't you think we should work together?
Sound?
Children...
What's wrong with them?
Guys, what are you doing here?
They look scared.
Okay, do you want to see something really cool?
Ta-da!
It's a hand-sewn crowbar.
See? Isn't it cute?
Please tell me, did something happen to you?
Is this your house?
No, it's not ours.
It's...
It's...
It's...
It's...
It's...
It's a...
The monster's house.
He took the elder brother.
He didn't show up when we were going this way at night.
He didn't notice us, he only took the brother.
And they went into that house?
Yes.
And you were following him?
All right. Great job.
We were following the blood trail of my brother.
He was wounded.
Wounded?
Don't worry.
We'll get rid of the villain and save your brother.
Really?
Really? Get rid of him?
Yes.
Definitely.
Tanjuro.
Hey, what's that sound?
That terrible sound doesn't calm down.
It's Suzumi.
Sound?
I can't hear anything.
Don't look!
Are you all right?
Are you all right?
Don't die!
The wound is so deep.
It's...
Even...
Even if I got out...
I got out...
I got out...
I got out...
I got out...
I got out...
I got out...
I got out...
I got out...
I...
I...
I'm dying.
He's dead.
He was very hurt. He suffered a lot.
Tanjiro, no matter what, what are we going to tell these children?
The Manilibria.TV Project
The Manilibria.TV Project
We failed to save him.
If we had come here a little earlier, we would have managed to save him.
Hey, this guy is yours.
He's not our brother.
He had a yellow-brown akimono.
I see. So he caught more than one person.
I swear, I'll bury you when it's all over.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Okay. Zenitsu, let's go.
Well, except for the two of us, no one else will help them.
Seriously?
Okay, then...
Hey, come here!
Don't look at me with a face distorted by rage!
Okay, I'll go.
I'm not forcing you at all.
I told you I'll go!
In case of danger, I'll leave this box here.
Even if something happens, you will be safe.
Okay, let's go.
Tanjiru!
Hey, Tanjiru!
Will you protect me?
Will you protect me?
Zenitsu, I hate to put you on the spot, but...
I broke my ribs and legs in the previous battle.
I haven't fully recovered yet, so...
You have broken bones!
Why did you do that?
You have broken bones!
Why do you have broken bones?
If you have broken bones, who will protect me?
I'm gonna die!
What do I do? What do I do?
I'm definitely gonna die!
I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die!
Broken bones? How come?
Now I'm definitely dead!
99.9%!
Zenitsu, calm down.
You'll survive.
Don't comfort me!
I'm not comforting you.
I'm not comforting you.
It's true, Zenitsu, you...
It's a bad thing!
You're not allowed in here!
G-Gentlemen,
we heard scratching sounds inside that box.
But even so, you shouldn't have left it.
This box is much more important to me than my own life.
I'm sorry, my butt.
This room is different.
No.
We inversed
in this Tsuzumi's rhythm.
I'm sorry to have split up with my brother.
But...
I'll protect you at any cost!
And in that case, Zenitsu would protect your own brother.
That doesn't cost.
Just tell me...
in that case, Zenitsu would protect his brother.
He will protect your brother.
Don't worry.
What's your name?
Teruko.
Really, Teruko?
Very beautiful name.
Among all these smells,
this one is the strongest,
he spread all over the house.
He ate a lot of people.
And this is the owner of this house.
There can be no mistake.
I'm going to die!
I'm going to die, I'm going to die, I'm definitely going to die!
We split up with Tanjiru!
Teruko!
Teruko!
No, no, no, no, no!
Don't shout like that!
If your screams hear the monster,
we'll have to be sweet!
Let's go outside!
What?
Why outside?
Or are you planning to run away alone?
You're always whining that you're going to die.
Aren't you ashamed?
You cling to the younger ones,
you don't feel sorry for yourself.
And why do you need this sword
that you carry on your belt?
These words have hurt my heart.
That's not true!
I will be useless in any case!
Let me go!
So you need to call someone from the village!
Let me go!
Because the children won't be able to cope with this situation!
Are you kidding me?
I was sure it was an entrance door.
Where's the exit?
Where was this door?
Is that it?
What about this one?
What about this one?
It's a monster!
What the hell?
What happened?
Don't look at me like that!
If they...
If they didn't interfere...
Teruko,
try not to scream.
This room will turn upside down.
Don't go into the hall.
Go back and hide behind the shelves.
Damn it!
Damn it!
Thanks to him, he escaped.
He was my friend.
He was my prey.
Why?
Why are they all breaking into other people's houses?
It's annoying.
This is my prey.
My prey on my territory.
Damn it!
Damn it!
Hey, listen!
I'm a member of the 10th rank demon hunter squad.
Team Tanjirou!
And now I'm going to kill you!
You're the rare blood I found myself!
Got you!
Teruko!
Now the tatami on the sides?
Looks like the rooms have turned.
So this is the art of demonic blood.
This whole house is his territory.
What's that?
There's a smell coming from here.
And it's not a demon.
Attack!
Attack!
Attack!
What kind of guy is that?
Is that a boar's head?
And he's got nichirin blades.
Excellent, monster.
Die on the battlefield and become another step for me.
So I can become even stronger and rise even higher.
Bish!
Bish!
Let's get started.
I'm going to attack!
Bish!

Hey Tanger, I think that girl still loves me...
What're you talking about?
It was obvious that she wouldn't be yours.
That's not true!
She could have agreed, because she wanted me to pursue her.
Her eyes shone with love when she gave me a tick.
And when she beat me, she put a piece of her heart into every blow.
She definitely, definitely, definitely loves me!
Say something!
And now it's time for the secret of Taise.
I heard that Zenitsu becomes shy in front of girls, and his heart starts to beat.
You can't do anything!
Girls are so cute, so gentle, and they smell so good!
Well, I'm thinking about them again, and I remembered that girl.
If I get out of this house, I'm going to go to her and rub her cheek!
Next, episode 12.
The boar shows her tits, Zenitsu falls asleep.
Hey! Don't ignore me, Tanjiro!
