What is it, demon?
What is it, demon?
Take it on!
Egor, you're pressing too hard on him.
Lose your grip.
I'm holding him just because he's trying to move.
Commander, if you use your breathing technique while your lungs are compressed, your vessels will explode.
His vessels will explode? I like that, it sounds bright!
Come on, let it explode!
Poor child.
Such a weak, unfortunate child.
Namuamidabutsu.
Commander?
Nezuko!
She's my sister! She's my younger sister!
Nezuko is different!
Even though I don't know what the reason is!
Episode 1
All the people are your family.
Protect the people!
People...
You have to protect and save them.
Never hurt them.
I will never hurt them.
Nezuko...
What happened?
The girl, the demon, turned away from the blood.
Hotsuna Zugawa cut her three times.
She put her bloody hand in front of her face.
She held back and didn't bite him.
And this is proof that Nezuko will never attack people.
What are you doing, Tamioka?
Tanjiru...
I'm sure that even after this,
there will be those who will not accept Nezuko.
And so you will have to prove it yourself.
That you and Nezuko can fight on the side of the hunters
and that you can be useful.
What kind of feeling is this?
I'm like a steam.
His voice...
I have such lightness in my head
because of the voice of this man.
Go and defeat the demons of the twelve moons.
You will do this, and everyone will recognize you.
And it will give enough weight to your words.
We...
We and Nezuko will defeat Kibutsuji.
And we will definitely do it.
Let's swing the sword and cut this chain of suffering.
Since you are now too weak, Tanjiru,
first defeat the demons of the twelve moons.
Yes, sir!
Don't laugh!
No, no, no!
I don't think we should talk about
that the hushers have phenomenal abilities.
After many years of hard training,
they challenged death
and defeated the demons of the twelve moons.
Yes! Great achievement!
That is why hushers are respected
and treated accordingly to them.
So, Tanjiru, watch your words when you talk to them.
Yes, sir!
There is something else.
Sanemi, Obanai.
And I ask you not to bother the younger ones too much.
Yes, sir!
Yes, sir!
Tanjiru, our conversation with you is over.
You may leave.
In this case, let me send the team to my place.
Great! Take it, please.
I'm sorry for the previous incident.
Now let's start the hushers' meeting.
Please, wait!
Come back!
Please, wait!
Please, let me hit this guy's forehead with a sledgehammer!
I...
Shut up! Shut your mouth!
I'll hit him as many times as he hit Nezuko!
Hitting with a sledgehammer is not a violation of the team's rules!
Shut up! Calm down already!
Let me go!
Stop it!
Come on!
No one gave you the right to interrupt the gentleman.
We're sorry, sir!
We're sorry, sir!
We're sorry!
We're sorry!
We're sorry!
Oh, Chirak!
You're so handsome!
So handsome!
Go away from my sight!
Yes, sir!
Tanjirou!
Give my bow to Miss Tamayo.
Wait!
I heard that he mentioned Miss Tamayo!
Shut up already!
We got angry because of you!
I almost put my pants on!
Hushers are so scary!
Take into account the situation!
I will never forgive you!
I will never forgive you!
I will never forgive you!
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
The project is announced on manilibria.tv
Thank you for choosing us.
Hello, is anyone home?
Hello, is anyone home?
Hello.
God, no one is picking us up.
Let's take a look at the garden.
Hey, come here.
I'm sorry.
My body hurts so badly.
The headquarters was also huge.
But this place is even bigger.
By the way, is this Buttercup's estate?
Hey, is anyone here?
Is anyone here?
This must be...
Oh, right.
Tsuguko...
Her name is...
Tsuguko?
This is Miss Tsuyori Kanao.
This is Miss Tsuyori Kanao.
This is the girl from the final selection.
Hey...
You've already forgotten how she came at him last night.
Tsuguko is a swordsman trained by Hashara.
They select people with outstanding talents and skills.
She's a girl, but she's amazing.
I'm sorry, Miss Tsuyori.
We came at the order of Miss Kocho.
Can we enter the estate?
Do you mind?
Who are you?
We came at the order of Miss Kocho.
How are you?
Did you bring the wounded?
Let's go.
Okay.
She's fast.
Oh...
Five times?
I have to drink it five times a day?
And drink this medicine for three whole months?
If I drink it, I won't be able to eat.
It's terribly bitter.
It's real torture.
If I drink the medicine,
will my arms and legs heal?
Seriously?
Listen, it really will help.
Please stop screaming.
Tell me how it works.
Someone explain it to me.
This guy is still hysterical.
Hey, listen, my arms and legs,
what will happen to you?
Hey, what will happen if I take it?
Zenitsu!
Please calm down.
Didn't we explain it many times?
If you don't stop this circus,
we'll tie you up.
Oh my God.
Zenitsu!
How are you feeling?
Aren't you hurt?
You still climbed up the mountain.
Tanjirou...
Tanjirou!
Just listen!
This terrible spider bit me
and I was terribly painful because of its poison.
This girl was constantly screaming at me.
I'm so tired of it.
Hey, get off me.
I have nothing to do here.
Oh, Zenitsu,
did you get smaller?
I almost turned into a spider.
My arms and legs are very short now.
So that's how it is.
Where's Inosuke?
Maybe you saw Murata?
I don't know any Murata,
but Inosuke is lying next to me.
Oh, really?
He was here all this time,
and I didn't even notice.
Inosuke, are you okay?
I'm so glad you're okay.
I'm so sorry
that I couldn't help you.
It's okay.
Don't worry about it.
Your voice.
Are you sure?
Inosuke.
I heard that he lost his voice
or something like that.
I don't know the details,
but I heard that
you were hurt in the neck,
and when he was screaming very loudly,
he finally got a scratch.
It affected his throat.
Now he's in humiliation,
so he's lying calmly,
and it's very funny.
Why are you laughing at him so grossly?
What happened?
I'm so sorry
that I was so weak.
Hold on, Inosuke.
You're not one of those
who fall into humiliation.
You did everything you could.
You're cool.
You can't imagine how happy I am
that you survived.
Did anyone see that?
Did anyone?
Did you see that?
Zenitsu
and Inosuke.
Thank God
you're alive.
It's okay.
I was told
that you could live here, Inosuke.
I'm serious.
I'm serious.
I'm serious.
I'm serious.
I'm serious.
I'm serious.
I'm serious.
I was seriously hurt
on Mount Itagumo.
It hurt very much.
It hurt terribly
to be honest.
Nezuko.
Thank you
for protecting me
on the mountain.
I didn't know that
not only you,
but also Urokodaki and Mr. Tomioka,
for our sake
they all risk their lives.
and all of them care about us, I need to become as strong as possible, even today the Lord,
one way or another, saved your and my life, the voice of that person, he was mysteriously
calming, from his conversations, a feeling of lightness appeared in my head, I wonder who he is,
exactly, you have a lack of knowledge, it hurts me and it's hard, but I will continue to fight
because one day I will become an adult, and then I will grow old and die, and in the end Nezuko the demon will
remain completely alone, you will be too lonely Nezuko, I promise you that soon I will turn you back into a
human, as you previously reported, the number of demons increased as never before, and this means that the
threat to the lives of people is greater than ever before, the ranks of hunters for demons need
what do you think about this, the incident on the mountain on the taguma explained everything, the level of training of new hunters is getting worse and worse,
most of them are useless, the teachers must be blind, they can at least determine whether someone is suitable or not,
this guy today proved to be worthy, he hit you so hard, he has potential, the more people there are, the more difficult it is to control
and distinguish them, not to mention how society has changed for this era, except for those who joined the
squad for the fact that their relatives were killed or those whose relatives hunted demons for generations,
forcing someone to show even greater determination to swim to achieve any results is cruel,
but given the fact that that guy faced demons 12 moons so soon after joining the squad,
he can quite lure them out, even we rarely manage to meet them, but I envy him, I agree
but the fact that the lowest five was so sharply activated may mean that the muzan is far from the mountain on the taguma,
as in the case of sasakusa, when the muzan wants to hide something, he easily raises the noise to get rid of us and this seriously
annoys, however, these demons continue to eat people, gain strength and survive, for the sake of all those who died,
we can do only one thing, I am sure that of you, the current hashir, I have gathered the best squad since the time of the first
your success
kibutsu shi muza I swear that I will overcome you in whatever it takes we will definitely kill you
kaze wo nototte arashi no saki wa mienakutatte mou michi wa eramenai kaji no kore
mayoi wa itsumo aijou to hikari wo hagari ni kakeru sa tachi agarunda mou ichi no
мы
и
It's still hard to believe that not all demons eat people.
It's just a miracle.
If that's the case, then the fact that we found the heir of the Butsutsu is...
Well, it's a real miracle.
Ha-ha-ha, a bright idea, and it looks so much like you.
And now it's time for the secret of the Taisho.
I heard that the gentleman is the 97th head of the detachment.
In order not to miss this opportunity,
we, the Hasher, must be a connecting link for the hunter detachment.
Are you ready for this, Hasher of Sound?
Of course, Hasher of Flame.
Next, Episode 24, Recovering Training.
