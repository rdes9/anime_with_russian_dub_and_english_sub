I've been holding on for so long! I can do it! And not today! Never in the future, even if I'm broken!
I will never give up!
I will never give up!
I will never give up!
Episode 13
The most precious thing in life
Where are you, Tanjiro?
I can still hear this terrible sound. Just be careful, Tanjiro!
Um, Zenitsu, I think we're going in circles.
I knew it! I think so too! Well done, Shoichi! I knew you could make it!
Okay, can you check this room? Is it safe?
What the hell? Okay, okay, just don't look at me like that. Okay, I'll do it myself.
There's no one here. Let's go this way.
Tanjiro, please show yourself!
The room just turned upside down!
I can do it! I'm sure I can do it! I'll make it to the end!
Broken bones or not, it doesn't matter! I can do it! I can fight!
Show him how unwavering you are! Broken bones or not!
It's a bad thing! Nothing has changed!
The only thing left is strength and spirit to overcome him!
Use your head, not just your spirit!
Think, think, think!
It was close! I barely made it back!
Damn it! It's so annoying! I have to swallow more Marechi! I can't lose!
I don't even have time to think!
Hey, you! Your name!
Kyuugai!
Kyuugai! I won't give you Marechi! I won't back down! I won't give up!
Just give up!
I want to swallow some more Marechi and get back my place among the demons of 12 moons!
Just give up!
It's boring!
Everything you've written is so boring!
Everything to the last word is garbage!
It's not beautiful, it's not interesting, it's not impressive!
Maybe you'd better stop writing?
It's an empty waste of paper and ink!
Besides, you haven't been out for a long time, so it's not surprising that your work is so boring.
All you need is to enjoy the game on Tsuzumi while you're sitting here.
Although you won't be able to teach anyone this.
There you go!

S Oh no!
SH him.
Close your eyes you damnhealth!
Я gaat guru policyê
I dare you to keep one distance from yourances!
Just don't tell me that he can attack even faster!
Yeah, oh, yeah!
Happy New Year!
Let's celebrate!
Faster!
It's not over yet, because now he's got five claws instead of three.
I got it.
I dodged the attack without stepping on the sheets,
and now I understand how to deal with it.
Short and fast breaths. Faster!
Thanks to this, I can strain my muscles around my broken leg.
And right before I attack with my claws,
the smell of mold appears.
Here it is! Claw attack!
From above!
From the left!
From the right!
From the back!
It turns away from all the attacks.
Full concentration.
Here's the breath.
The ninth style!
I can't believe it!
I can't believe it!
The ninth style!
Water splash!
Whistle!
Reduce the time and area needed to land.
He adapted to changing rooms!
Forward! Even closer!
At the distance of the blow!
Forward!
Right to his face!
I see an intermediate thread!
Pull!
Your demonic blood art is impressive!
The ninth style!
I accidentally took a deep breath.
I'm the eldest son!
The eldest son!
Boy...
Tell me...
Do you really think
that my demonic blood art was impressive?
It was amazing.
But...
I can't forgive you for killing people.
I see.
Wait a minute.
We need to take a sample of the blood.
He took the blood.
He really did?
He took the blood.
It's better to just stab him.
Yoshiro really is a master.
Since he created something like this.
A cat?
So you're the one who delivered it to Mrs. Tamae?
Okay, okay.
Thank you.
Now everything is ready.
Okay.
Be careful.
Thanks to Yoshiro's technique,
it was invisible until it meowed.
And then it disappeared again,
meowing for the second time.
Is that true?
Where are these two?
I have to find them.
Be quiet.
My...
pens.
It's so boring,
your pen.
Everything is garbage
until the last word.
It's not beautiful,
it's not interesting,
it's not impressive.
It's not garbage at all.
At least,
not for this guy.
He never stepped on them.
Rest in peace.
And my demonic blood art,
and my game on Suzumi,
were recognized by them.
Thank you for choosing us.
Kiyoshi!
Give me your hand!
Kiyoshi!
Give me your hand!
Kiyoshi!
Give me your hand!
Kiyoshi!
Give me your hand!
Tanjiro...
Why are you throwing things?
We're so sorry.
Suzumi disappeared and we were scared.
I see.
I'm glad you're safe and safe.
Dima!
You were good here.
And you too, Kiyoshi.
Okay,
let's get out of here.
Get on your back.
Is your leg okay?
Yeah.
You need to hold on a little longer.
I smell Zenitsu and Shoichi.
They must be outside.
They're both safe.
I smell blood.
Something's wrong.
It's okay.
Let's hurry.
Take this!
Get out of here!
Take this!
Take the sword and fight!
You coward!
Tanjiro...
I...
I protected him.
I did it...
because you said
that he was much more important to you than your own life.
In fact, I...
I...
I...
I've always had very good hearing.
Sometimes...
I hear people talking even when I'm asleep.
And it's very scary.
I can't hear the sounds of demons anymore.
Tanjiro,
have you overcome that demon?
I hear you,
and also some strange loud footsteps.
Itsu!
Zenitsu!
Zenitsu!
Thank God!
You're okay!
She threw us out.
When the room turned upside down,
we fell out of the second floor window.
Tanjiro!
Really?
You protected me,
so I'm okay, but...
I'm glad to hear that.
But why are you crying?
I see why!
Did I fall right on my head?
Yes.
Am I...
Am I going to die?
My head is spinning!
What is it?
What is it?
Attack!
Attack!
It's him again!
The wild boar monster!
I can feel the presence of a demon!
It's him!
I recognized him by his voice!
He's the fifth survivor!
During the final selection,
he was the first to run to the top of the mountain,
and then came down from it before anyone else!
Break his head!
Hey, I found him!
Stop!
Who are you?
Get out of the way!
I'm Agatsuma Zenitsu!
I'm also a member of the demon hunter squad!
Demon hunter?
Do I have to tell you that?
We have to get rid of this thing!
Now get out of the way!
I won't go away!
It's the Tangent Box!
Don't argue with me!
If you're so stubborn,
I'll destroy you and the box!
I said, get out of the way!
And why?
In the box...
In the Tangent Box,
I won't let you touch it with your finger!
It's something very valuable for Tangent!
Come on!
What are you talking about?
There's a demon in this box!
Don't you understand?
I knew it from the very beginning!
I knew he was traveling with a demon.
The sounds of demons
don't sound like the sounds of people.
But...
But the Tangent Box
has such a gentle and kind sound
that I want to cry.
It's so gentle
that I've never heard anything like it before.
All living creatures
make sounds all the time.
The world is filled with all these sounds.
Breathing, heartbeat,
sounds of blood flowing through veins.
If I listen,
I can understand what a person is thinking.
But people have been lying to me
again and again.
And I've always trusted
those I wanted to trust.
Tanjiru is a hunter,
but he travels with a demon.
But I'm sure
there's a reason for that.
And I
can accept it.
I believe in it.
I...
Huh?
I...
I'm asking Tanjiru personally!
So be kind.
Get out of here!
Damn it, it's pissing me off!
You're pissing me off!
You won't even touch it with your finger!
It's a thing!
It's very important for Tanjiru!
You won't touch it until he comes back!
Damn it!
Take this!
Get out of here!
No!
Take this!
Get out of here!
Take this!
Give me the sword, you coward!
Tanjiru...
I...
I protected it...
because...
you said...
that it's much more important
for you...
than your own life.
And after all this,
you won't even pull out
your sword, stupid?
If you're a demon hunter too,
let's see how you fight!
If you won't fight,
then get out of the way!
Get out of here!
Enough!
If you won't get out of my way,
I'll pierce you
with this box!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
That's the demonic blood art!
It was spinning in my room,
but it could attack.
The closer the ki-butsuji demon,
the stronger and more problematic
his art is.
Can I really beat them?
And now, time for the secret taisho!
A fan of the legend of the eight samurais.
I've heard that he writes his own biography.
That's right. It's not the time to give up now.
Next, episode 14.
The house with Glicin's coat.
Your brother will do his best!
I forgot about the broken bones.
