Nezuko!
He's still not out!
Nezuko!
Nezuko!
The Urokodaki teacher told me that Nezuko is now a demon.
And that she is not so weak that she needs my protection.
I can really rely on Nezuko.
If I let her look after them, I can concentrate on the attack.
Nezuko!
Nezuko!
I'm going underground!
Protect these two!
You can do it!
In the swamp?
And this is...
This is the clothes and things of those people who they have kidnapped.
I'm afraid to imagine how many of them they have kidnapped.
I'm afraid to imagine how many of them they have kidnapped.
I'm afraid to imagine how many of them they have killed.
It's unforgivable.
It's unforgivable!
Did you catch your breath, boy?
There's no air in this swamp at all.
Besides, the darkness that surrounds you blocks your movements.
You can't move here like you did on the surface.
You had to look before jumping here, idiot!
Don't underestimate me.
How do you think?
Where have I been before this?
I don't know.
There's air at the top of Mount Sagiri.
There's still some room.
And besides,
there are techniques, all the power of which can be revealed only under water.
I'm afraid to imagine how many of them they have kidnapped.
I'm afraid to imagine how many of them they have killed.
Can they move in this swamp at such angles?
It doesn't matter.
You just have to strike when they come closer.
The style that can be used even when there is no reliable support.
Not the lower part of the body!
I can smell it!
Intermediate thread!
Full concentration!
Water breathing!
Sixth style!
Water turn!
Sixth style!
I can't breathe!
I have to get out of here!
Nezuko!
This girl is strong!
Apparently, she doesn't use her skills.
But she's still very strong!
Maybe she got a huge amount of his blood!
She's so fast, I can't dive into the swamp again!
Listen, I'm already used to her one-type attacks!
Even if she tears my head off,
even if my inner organs explode,
demons can heal in an instant!
I can't breathe!
Excellent!
Now I'll make a hole in your head!
Get your hands off my sister!
I just lost!
This guy beat all of my double!
All of you have an oily smell!
It's just a terrible smell!
And how many people did you kill?
Listen!
I can't breathe!
I can't breathe!
I can't breathe!
I can't breathe!
Listen!
If the girls lived longer,
they wouldn't be so tasty anymore!
We killed them for their own good!
You have to be grateful to us demons!
That's enough!
Now tell me what you know, Akibutsuji Muzane!
Speak!
Speak!
I can't speak!
I can't!
Thank you for choosing us!
I can't speak!
I can't!
Don't tell anyone!
Don't say anything about me!
If you tell me, I'll find out right away!
I'm always watching you!
I can't!
I can't speak!
I can't! I can't!
The smell of fear comes from him.
He's shaking his way through his bones.
I can't tell you anything!
Got it?
And again, I couldn't find out anything.
Nezuko!
Nezuko!
Nezuko!
Nezuko!
Nezuko!
Nezuko!
Nezuko!
Nezuko!
Nezuko!
She's sleeping.
Her blood's stopped too.
It means she's asleep to be cured.
Forgive me.
Have a little patience.
I will definitely turn you back into a human!
Mr. Kazumi, is everything all right with you?
I lost my fiance.
You lost your fiance?
I lost my fiance.
You lost your fiance?
I lost my fiance.
You lost your fiance?
I lost my fiance.
I lost my fiance.
How can I be all right?
Mr. Kazumi.
It doesn't matter how many people you lost.
You have no choice but to live on.
And it doesn't matter how big the loss was.
It doesn't matter how big the loss was.
What do you know about it?
To a child like you!
I have to go.
Here, take it.
I hope it will serve you well, Mrs. Satoko.
You also had to go through a lot, didn't you?
I'm sorry!
I've told you terrible things!
Please forgive me!
I'm so sorry!
It's so sad to look at his hands.
They are rude because of constant training and strong.
The boy's hands shouldn't be like that.
The life of this young girl is in your hands!
All right!
All right!
It's not just about me.
How many people have you tortured, tortured and killed?
Kibutsu Jimudzan!
I will never forgive you for this!
Oh!
The next task is Asakusa Tokyo!
There are rumors that a demon is hiding there!
Is it the next task already?
Yes, it is!
Wait a minute!
There is no time to wait!
Come on!
Just shut up and go!
Please wait!
All the big cities are like this!
It's dark at night, but it's so bright here!
What big buildings!
What are they?
What are they?
What are they?
What are they?
What are they?
What are they?
What big buildings!
What are they?
Cities...
Cities...
My head is spinning!
Let's go there, Nezuko!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Udon.
I'm sorry.
Can I have a plate of udon and yamakaki, please?
Yes, of course.
I've never been to places like this.
There are too many people here.
Here's your udon and yamakaki.
Thank you very much.
This smell.
Why did I smell it so clearly?
It's the same smell that was in my house.
Kibutsuji-mutsan.
Kibutsuji-mutsan.
Kibutsuji-mutsan.
This smell is coming from him.
It's him.
Daddy.
Who's that?
It's him.
Everything's fine.
It's him.
Don't worry.
It's him.
He lives here pretending to be a human.
Boy, do you need help?
You look worried.
What's going on here?
Mom!
They're people.
A girl and a woman.
They smell like people.
They don't know.
They don't understand that this guy is a demon.
And that he eats people.
Do you know him?
No.
If memory doesn't change,
I've never seen this kid before.
It must be...
He's confused me with someone.
Oh, you think so?
Honey, what happened?
Honey?
Wait!
THE END
THE END
THE END
I finally tracked Kibutsu Jimudzana.
If I beat him, Nezuko will become a human.
And still,
everything looks pretty stylish in Asakusa, right?
You would look great in such clothes.
And now it's time for the secret of Taisho.
Yutaka from the udon shop was born and grew up in Asakusa.
I heard that he makes udon in Asakusa because he madly loves this city.
Costume!
Now I look like an adult.
Let's focus on the mission.
Next, episode 8.
The smell of charming blood.
