        <pre>You were familiar with one of them, weren't you?
It seems that there is no survivor around.
We were told that several Mizunotes had joined the battle,
but they may already be dead.
Let's go.
Isn't the moon beautiful?
We were entrusted with this joint task.
Let's try to get along with each other.
I came just to kill the demons.
You're so stubborn.
Okay, then let's split up here.
I'll keep going west.
Agreed.
Don't come any closer to my family!
Get out of here!
Water breathing! Second style!
Water ring!
Let's look at the sky full of mud.
My heart is shaking, my hands are trembling.
There is something I want to grab.
That's all.
Even if I look at the night sky,
I can only change myself.
That's all.
I know the reason to become strong.
Take me and move forward.
No matter what.
If you can become strong for someone
no matter if it's an endless dream or an unstoppable present,
stand up as many times as you can.

Take me and move forward.
I don't have enough strength.
Besides, my blood flow has weakened me.
Water breathing.
Second style.
Modification.
Horizontal water ring.
What was that?
What's going on?
Inosuke, are you okay?
Did he do that?
That was cool, damn it!
Great!
I'm glad you're okay.
I'm glad you're okay.
I'm glad you're okay.
Great!
Now I can cut his thick neck.
Water breathing.
The last and strongest style.
It's like the whole air is shaking.
It's getting ready to do something absolutely incredible.
Now I'm going to finish him.
Full concentration.
Water breathing.
The tenth style.
Watch out!
Inosuke!
Don't you dare die until I come back.
This is one of the demons of 12 moons.
Don't die!
Don't die!
Not under any circumstances!
Damn it!
Breathing is getting harder and harder.
I don't feel my hands or legs anymore.
Inosuke, forgive me.
We'll see.
A bit more.
So that's you, I see.
You can't do that.
Don't give up!
Don't give up, do you hear me?
No...
Give up...
Who... Who are you?
Hello. Are you okay?
Water breath!
Second style!
Water end!
How did you land?
I beg you, please stop!
What are you staring at?
This is not a show.
What are you doing?
Aren't you allies?
Allies?
Don't compare our connection with such nonsense.
We are allies.
We are allies.
We are allies.
We are allies.
We are allies.
This isn't silly nonsense.
We are a family.
We are
fondly connected...
and also,
it is just between me and my sister.
So please, stop getting mixed up.
Or I'm going to separate you.
You're mistaken.
It's completely wrong to call them stupid if the connection is not even.
Moreover, the smell of trust comes from people connected to each other.
But from the two of you, the smell of fear, hatred and disgust comes out.
This can not be called a lie.
This is a fake, a complete lie.
You!
You!
Hey, look how I came in time.
There are demons here.
Even I can kill such a little demon.
Please wait a second!
Step aside!
I want to get an increase.
As soon as you get it, the higher authorities will reward you.
My squad was almost destroyed.
But I'll kill these demons myself and get down from the mountain.
Get it!
No!
Stop!
He was cut in a moment.
But how is he?
Hey!
What did you say there?
You...
What did you just say?
What an incredible pressure!
The air has become so heavy and dense!
And the noses...
I'm sorry.
Just hold on, okay?
A little more!
A little more!
I'll be back as soon as I get rid of this demon.
I'll save you.
Whatever it takes.
Hey, you.
What did you just say?
Repeat it to me again.
Come on.
Speak!
Of course!
I'll repeat it as many times as you want!
Your noses are a complete lie!
Damn it!
Thank you for choosing us.
Damn it!
Hiding in such a place!
What a shame!
And still, I need to think.
How to kill the one who is protected by the attack with swords?
What should I do?
What should I do?
How should I kill him?
Think, think, think, think, think!
Wow!
This is bad!
Very bad!
Until he comes back...
I must somehow...
What the hell did I just think?
Damn it!
Now is not the time for games!
Damn it!
It looks like you have been infected with Tontaro bacteria.
If I keep going like this, it will be too close.
I use brains that don't look like me.
Great!
I cut you!
It's really simple.
If you can't cut something with one sword, you just need to hit it with another.
That is, look!
I have two swords!
I am omnipotent!
I thought to run away!
Hey you!
Come back, damn it!
I just want you to know.
I'm not going to kill you with one blow.
I will cut you into pieces and turn you into minced meat.
But...
If you take your words back,
I will serve you by killing you with one blow.
But...
If you take your words back,
I will serve you by killing you with one blow.
I will serve you by killing you with one blow.
I will not take them back!
Because my words are pure truth!
You are the only one who is wrong!
You are the only one who is wrong!
Damn it!
This bastard!
Damn it!
Where did he go?
I told you!
It doesn't hurt at all!
What doesn't hurt, doesn't hurt!
Since it's gone,
I'll follow you by smell.
I'll follow you by smell.
Damn it!
Where are you?
You piece of shit!
How did you get in there?
Damn it!
You're trying to make me use my brain again.
You're crazy!
What the...
Oh, I got it!
He's scared just by looking at me.
Well, it's too late.
What the...
Now what?
He just dropped the skin!
God!
Come on, now he's too big!
Now it's definitely a piece of shit!
I've never felt such a force coming from the enemy!
His power is going to crush me!
It's a bad thing!
I can't win!
I'm going to die!
They're going to kill me!
Don't die!
Don't even think about dying until I come back!
Go on with your life with your head high up.
And good luck in battles.
No way!
No way!
I'm not going to lose!
I'm Hoshibiru Inosuke from the demon killer squad!
Come here, you piece of shit!
He's so fast!
I can't see him!
You're not a beast!
The third blow!
Swallow!
They're broken!
Shit!
I couldn't defend myself with my breathing technique!
Don't come any closer to my family!
Get out of here!
I'm not going to die!
The first breath of a beast!
Take this!
Swallow!
I did it!
I did it, but...
What the hell?
He didn't even move!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Inosuke.
I want you to survive, Inosuke.
You...
Who...
You...
What was that?
He killed him?
That guy?
Who...
Who is he?
Who the hell is he?
I don't know.
He's so fast!
The fourth breath of a beast!
Wave strike!
Damn it!
I've never seen anyone...
Who could be cooler than this guy?
It's all clear.
The spicy smell is disappearing.
And now I can smell it.
Now I can attack him.
He's smarter than I thought.
He's not afraid at all.
But it doesn't matter.
The first breath of a beast!
Wave strike!
