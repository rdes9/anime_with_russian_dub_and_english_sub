Rui! Rui! Rui! What are you doing? You can't go out!
Rui! Rui!
Episode 21. Against the rules of the detachment.
Since I was born, I was very weak. I never ran. I even walked with great difficulty.
Until Mr. Muzan appeared.
Poor child, let me save you.
My parents were not very happy with this.
Because now I have a strong body. But I should not go out in the sun. And from now on I had to eat people.
What have you done? What the hell are you doing? Rui!
A long, long time ago I heard a wonderful story.
It was about a father who died saving his dying child.
I was very touched by the amazing parental love and the same bonds.
The father who drowned in the river perfectly played his role as a parent.
But still, for some reason, my parents ...
For some reason, my parents ...
My parents tried to kill me.
My mother just cried and didn't even move a finger when they tried to kill me.
They must have been a fake.
Our knots were not real.
Forgive us.
It seems she is saying something. Is she still alive?
They gave me a strong and healthy body. I'm very sorry.
These were the last words of my mother before she died.
Then she died.
Everything will be fine, Rui. We will die together.
I was so angry at the attempt to kill me that I didn't even notice it.
But at that moment I realized that he wanted to die with me in order to atone for my sins as a killer.
These were the true knots.
And that night I cut them with my own hands.
But despite this, Mr. Muzan encouraged me.
Only your parents are to blame for refusing to accept you. Be proud of your strength.
I had no choice but to agree with him. I couldn't take what I had done.
Even realizing that only I was to blame for this.
And every day I missed my parents so much.
Even after creating a fake family, the feeling of emptiness did not leave me.
Because I was the strongest, no one could protect me, no one could cover me.
And the stronger I became, the less I remembered my human life.
And I didn't understand what I wanted to do. I was looking for clues that I didn't have.
Even though they were beyond my reach, and no matter how strong I tried to reach them, I couldn't reach them.
This is a small body. It comes from the abyss that overcomes it.
What are you doing here?
I'm here to help you.
I'm here to help you.
I'm here to help you.
I'm here to help you.
I'm here to help you.
My hands are so warm, so gentle like the sunlight.
Now I remember for sure that I wanted to apologize.
Forgive me. It's my fault. It's my fault for all this.
Forgive me. But since I killed a lot of people, I'm going to hell.
Dad, Mom, I can't go with you.
No, that's not true. We'll go together, even to hell.
Roy, Dad, Mom.
Roy, we'll always be with you.
It's all my fault. Forgive me. Forgive me.
Forgive me.
Don't feel sorry for the demon that ate people.
Even if he looks like a child, it's still a terrible monster that lived for hundreds of years.
To avenge the people who were killed and to save the world.
Yes, it's a fact. I'm without any regret, without the head of any demon.
But as for those who were tormented by the demon's life, those who felt sorry for the dead,
I will never give up on them. Because demons were people too.
Just like me.
He's not a terrible monster at all.
Demons were deprived of hope.
Demons are miserable souls.
Roy, Dad, Mom, I can't go with you.
Forgive me.
No.
What?
What?
Why did you stop me, Tomioka?
You told me that we will never be able to get along with demons.
Then how do you understand that?
That's why everyone hates you.
Thank you for choosing us.
God, this antidote to Ms. Kochi is very effective.
That's right. And she did it only by assessing the current situation.
She's just amazing.
It's about him.
Oh, that guy?
Since he defeated that demon, it slowed down the spread of the poison a little.
Great. It's done.
Looks good.
There's a chance he'll get better.
And still, I would like to finish my work and leave this place as soon as possible.
Yeah, me too.
Yeah, it stinks here.
Okay, Tomioka, please get out of the way.
I... I hate them.
Oh, I'm sorry.
It seems you didn't even suspect that they hated you.
It was inappropriate. Please forgive me.
Boy!
Yes?
Boy, you're protecting the demon.
I don't want to hurt you, so get away from her.
You're mistaken.
I mean, you're right, but she's my younger sister.
She's my sister, you know?
Really? Poor child.
In that case, I'll kill her with a weak poison that won't hurt her.
Can you move?
Even if you can't, it's better to start.
Take your sister and run.
Tomioka!
I'm sorry, and thank you very much!
Isn't that against the rules of the detachment?
My whole body is burning!
It hurts so much!
I want to scream out of pain!
Come on!
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on!
So I have to leave the demon hunter detachment?
Even if she's my sister,
they won't let me travel with demons.
I see you're serious, Tomioka.
Who would have thought that Hasher would protect the demon?
No matter how serious you are,
I'm not going to waste my time on you.
So have a good day.
So you're trying to catch up with me?
I'm not against you trying to stop me,
but don't forget about the other one.
Don't stop!
Come on, move!
You have to run as far as you can!
Bad news!
What happened?
I ran with all my might!
Nezuko!
Hunter!
Run, Nezuko!
Run!
Please!
Don't let them catch you!
Hurry!
She's gotten smaller and more like a child.
She's just running away.
She's not even trying to attack.
But why?
There's nothing to think about.
My only task is to kill this demon.
Tomioka!
Do you hear me, Tomioka?
Since I'm attacking you,
you have to run as far as you can.
Tomioka!
Since I'm attacking you to kill the demon,
and that was justified,
I don't think it can be considered a violation.
But now you're clearly acting against the rules of the detachment.
You're not letting me kill the demon.
What are you trying to achieve?
You have nothing to say at all!
This is the last warning!
At least explain yourself!
If I'm not mistaken,
it happened two years ago.
Please, let's not talk about the past.
Are you offended?
Are you still angry because of my words
that people hate you?
An order!
An order!
I have an order from headquarters!
Tanjiro and Nezuko
Tanjiro and Nezuko
must be captured and brought back to headquarters!
Tanjiro and Demon Nezuko
must be captured and brought back to headquarters!
Tanjiro who wears a clad haori
and with a scar on his forehead!
Nezuko, a girl demon with a bamboo in her mouth!
What? Nezuko?
Turn them back!
Turn them back!
Tanjiro who wears a clad haori
and with a scar on his forehead!
Nezuko, a girl demon with a bamboo in her mouth!
Turn them back!
Turn them back!
He has a scar on his forehead.
Okay, let's take him.
Look, it looks like his jaw is broken.
It's not a good idea to tie him up.
Who's that?
I don't know.
Demon?
Doesn't look like it.
It's a human.
He wears our formal pants.
Hey!
It's a mask!
He's a human!
Okay, then let's take him.
Wow!
He's been badly injured.
Why was he hanged here?
I couldn't do anything.
I couldn't kill any demon with my own hands.
You know what?
Maybe I'm not that strong.
They tied us up like mummies.
Who are all these people?
They cleared this place pretty quickly.
And that girl?
Wasn't she at the final selection?
Her hairstyle reminds me of the hairstyle of a girl who tied us up.
Should we take them to the butterfly's estate?
Yes.
Take all the wounded there.
I will hunt the remaining demons,
so you can work calmly.
I've heard about them somewhere.
The cleaning squad, the Kakushe.
The squad that cleans the place of the battle of hunters and demons.
They say that the members of this squad don't have the skills of swordsmen.
It's dawn already.
Wake up!
Hey, I said, wake up!
Get up!
Hey, hey you!
Come on!
You thought you could sleep all day?
Wake up, you fucking tree!
You're in the presence of Hasher!
You're in the presence of Hasher!
You're in the presence of Hasher!
You're in the presence of Hasher!
You're in the presence of Hasher!
Hasher!
You're in the presence of Hasher!
You're in the presence of Hasher!
You're in the presence of Hasher!
You're in the presence of Hasher!
You're in the presence of Hasher!
You're in the presence of Hasher!
You're in the presence of Hasher!
You're in the presence of Hasher!
You're in the presence of Hasher!
You're in the presence of Hasher!
You're in the presence of Hasher!
You're in the presence of Hasher!
You're in the presence of Hasher!
You're in the presence of Hasher!
The End
You finally opened your mouth, and that's the first thing you say?
If you don't deny it, then it's true?
People hate you for being insincere.
People...
Love me.
Answer differently, please.
Next, episode 22.
The owner of the estate.
