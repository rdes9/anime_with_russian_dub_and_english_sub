        <pre>The seventh style of animal breathing. Spatial review.
Found it!
Yes! Over there! I caught a powerful vibration from there!
Really? So hold your noses!
Damn! But first you have to deal with them!
Damn! Is there really no other way out?
Anilibria.TV presents...
...a blade that cuts through demons!
Spatial review.
Episode 16. Let the other do the first step.
No! No! Nezu! No! Where? Where? Where? Where are you?
Damn!
Here we are! I'll put them all in one blow!
Don't you dare! Back!
We need to come up with some way!
That's why we can't hurt them!
Murata?
I'll try to stop them, and you go!
What are you wearing, you wet pants?
I didn't pee in my pants, you stupid pig!
I wasn't talking to you, so shut up!
Maybe then I behaved like a coward, but I'm also a demon hunter!
I can stop them!
Now I know that you need to cut the threads!
And that they move very predictably, so it won't be difficult!
And I won't let the spiders get close!
Most likely, closer to the demon, you will meet people much stronger!
So go!
Okay! Thank you!
Let's go!
Hey, let me go!
I wanted to smear this scoundrel!
He called me a pig!
Shut up! Get out of here!
Get away from me! I'll cut you like this!
Damn! I just have to teach him a lesson!
Stop it already!
You stupid pig called me Nanjuro!
I'm Tanjuro!
Better tell me where we're going!
I never make mistakes!
Only...
Damn it! Where did so many threads come from?
It could mean only one! The demon is very close!
There are more!
No!
No! Come to me!
Please, call someone strong!
Otherwise, I'll kill everyone here!
Please!
I beg you!
Will you be able to overcome them?
The closer you come to me, the stronger my threads and the stronger the dolls become.
Mom...
Will you overcome them?
Rui...
You're wasting too much time on them.
Finish it already!
Otherwise, I'll tell my father!
I can do it! I'll finish it right now!
Mom will protect you!
Please!
Shut up!
Don't tell your father!
Just don't tell him!
Then please hurry up!
Mom...
Die! Die!
Die already! Otherwise, I won't recover!
Run!
Hurry!
They're controlling me! I can't control my movements!
I've never been this strong!
The demon is controlling her like a puppet!
At this rate, he'll break all her bones!
That's cruel!
You're right, boy.
What do you think?
That sound...
Please!
Kill me!
My legs...
My arms...
My bones...
My organs will be pierced!
Every movement hurts!
I can't take it anymore!
I'm going to die anyway!
Help me!
Please!
Kill me!
Enough!
Wait!
Don't you dare!
We have to help them!
Shut up!
Shut up!
But...
He's going to kill us!
They're very fast!
We should get distracted, or they'll kill us!
I know!
Let me think for a second!
I don't want to attack them,
but even if I cut off their threads, I can't help them!
And how do I immobilize them?
Got it!
Hey! Where are you going?
Great!
Follow me!
Hey!
Why are you turning around?
Don't be a fool!
Full concentration!
What power!
Great!
You got me!
What?
What's going on?
I want it too!
Take this!
See?
I'm not inferior to you!
I'm sorry!
I didn't see it!
What?
Now don't you dare judge me!
Damn!
What useless dolls!
The last goat remains!
The End
Nezuko!
Nezuko!
Where are you?
Nezuko!
Tanjirou!
Taban!
Chuntaro!
Where are you going?
I'm sorry for everything!
Chuntaro!
You came straight after me!
You're so cute!
Not like Nezuko, of course!
I'm sorry for everything!
Well, let's go look for Nezuko together!
Look at him!
Look how high he jumped!
Well done!
He's the last one left!
Well, don't you dare blink!
I got it!
I won't blink!
Please don't hurt him!
I don't need you anymore!
I don't need you!
You're useless!
You're useless!
Stop!
They're all dead!
The End
Let's go.
You're right.
This way!
We're almost there!
The wind has changed.
It's turning.
Now I can tell where the demon is.
I can smell two new scents.
There!
And the socks!
I made him before you!
I'll cut his head off!
He...
doesn't have a head!
Nezuko!
Where are you?
Where are you, Tanjirou
and the socks?
Don't leave me alone
in this terrible forest!
What's that?
You know what?
It's pissing me off!
We need to find Nezuko
and get out of this damn forest!
Nezuko!
Where is his weak spot?
He doesn't have a head!
And the socks!
What do we do?
Calm down!
We'll try to cut it!
We'll tear off the body
from the neck to the left side!
The area is big.
It won't be easy,
but maybe...
Wait!
We need to do it together!
Hurry!
But I managed to get back!
I forgot the spiders!
Don't move!
With the core!
And the socks!
We'll fight together!
We'll become one!
If we stick together,
we'll get over him!
Asshole!
Don't try to
make me lose my head!
You're in the way!
And the socks!
Get away from me!
And the socks!
Come on!
Full concentration!
Water breath!
Fourth style!
Wave strike!
And now cut!
Damn!
It's so annoying!
Everything goes according to his plan!
As if everything was predetermined!
A natural flow
like a stream of water in the river!
Instead of trying
to overtake me,
he watched
and waited for the right opportunity!
To be continued...
I'm not worse than you!
I'll prove it, asshole!
This smell...
You're good, socks!
I lost...
I lost!
But this doll was the strongest!
If Rui didn't start
threatening me,
I'd be in panic!
In panic!
Up!
Water breath!
First style!
He'll kill me!
Think!
Think!
But...
But...
Death
will set me free!
I'll find peace!
Fifth style!
Blessing rain!
It's...
It feels like I'm standing
under the rain.
I don't feel pain at all.
I don't suffer.
I feel so warm.
I'm not afraid of anything.
I'm not afraid of anything.
I'm not afraid of anything.
I couldn't dream of such a death.
And now...
I'm free.
I'm so sorry!
Forgive me!
Why are you so angry?
What did I do wrong?
It's your fault
that you don't understand anything.
How do I understand?
Mom is scolding dad again.
Dad...
Stop!
No! No!
Dad!
His eyes
are so kind.
When I was a human
a long time ago
someone was looking at me
with the same eyes.
Who was it?
I don't remember.
I only remember that
I was dear to this man.
I wonder
what's wrong with him now.
Mom...
There is a demon called 12 Odogs.
Stop!
Be careful!
The real demon of 12 moons is right here!
The real demon of 12 moons is right here!
The real demon of 12 moons is right here!
The real demon of 12 moons is right here!
The real demon of 12 moons is right here!
The real demon of 12 moons is right here!
The real demon of 12 moons is right here!
The real demon of 12 moons is right here!
The real demon of 12 moons is right here!
The real demon of 12 moons is right here!
The real demon of 12 moons is right here!
The real demon of 12 moons is right here!
You still can't pronounce my name correctly.
Remember your name, Kamaboko Gonpachiro!
Wrong.
Shukariki Gengar?
No.
Itadakitontaro!
You missed it!
And now it's time to share the secret of Taisho.
Inosuke can correctly pronounce the name of a person every seventh time.
You've made a mistake three times already.
Remember it at last.
Anaka Kamjuro!
Come on, it's warmer!
Hamado Tanguro!
Almost!
Kamado!
Well?
I don't give a shit about your name.
Damn, you almost called him.
Next, episode 17.
You have to learn something.
You are you, and I am me.
Got it, Tanguro?
