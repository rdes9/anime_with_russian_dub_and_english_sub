I...
ATTACK!
Annoying...
How annoying...
Teruko!
Hold on to the furniture!
This demon is incredibly strong!
Stop these pointless attacks!
Oh, where are you, lie
Really, lie
Village
Here
We have to go

It's so annoying!
These little bugs are running around in my house!
The room is crumbling and crumbling!
This is so much fun!
So much fun!
Don't step on it!
Who the hell are you?
What were you thinking when you stepped on a little kid?
Not bad, not bad!
No one has ever been able to leave me like this!
Why did he come to me?
Isn't he a demon hunter?
My swords will hurt you,
because they don't look like the one you use.
The way they tear apart flesh,
that's what I'm proud of.
Stop it!
The demon is over there!
I don't care!
Damn you!
Disappear!
Die!
The floor was split in one moment.
The cuts appeared in Tsuzumi's rhythm.
It looks like traces of a beast's claws.
Turn right!
Turn left!
Damn bugs!
Damn, destroyed bugs!
I think I'm starting to understand.
We're already in the other room!
But what does it mean?
That demon didn't hit Tsuzumi.
I smell several demons in this house.
Is there another demon from Tsuzumi here?
Besides...
I smell blood.
Everything will be fine.
Just follow me, okay?
Okay.
Another man torn to pieces!
What's going on?
It's all good.
There are no demons here.
Okay, let's go there.
Don't look around.
Look straight ahead.
I think I smell another smell.
It's a special smell of blood I've never smelled before.
It doesn't look like strong bleeding.
Please forgive me, Zenitsu.
W-w-w-warn me!
W-w-warn me!
W-warn me, at least!
If you want to say something, warn me about it!
W-w-warn me!
W-w-warn me, at least!
If you want to say something, warn me about it!
My heart just stopped a little.
I'm sorry.
If it happens, it will make you a killer, you understand?
You understand?
I'm sorry, it's just...
You sweat so much, you inhale and tremble.
So what?
Am I not doing everything I can?
Well, I'm sorry, but I'm also nervous about you, so...
Oh no!
I'm sorry!
And still...
If we talk a lot, those demons will find us.
They can really find us.
That's why I think we should behave as quietly as possible.
Am I right?
A couple of kids.
They must be very good to taste.
What did I tell you?
There's a demon!
There's a demon, you understand?
Don't come any closer!
Don't come any closer!
Stop it!
We're not tasty!
We're disgusting to taste!
I'm serious!
This child is skin to bone, so it's dry to the point where it's impossible!
I won't recognize it until I try it!
No!
What was that?
What a fast tongue!
It split into two parts!
It's just impossible!
Zenitsu, get up!
It's all in my knees!
80% of my fear is in my knees!
It's not the time for that!
Leave me alone and run!
And as fast as you can!
I can't leave you!
This child is so kind to me!
Even though I make such horrible sounds!
I have to do something!
If I don't protect him, what will happen to him?
If he dies so young, it will be very tragic!
But now I'm terribly weak!
Get up!
I don't have the strength to protect him!
But if I don't protect him...
I'll suck your brains out through your ears!
Zenitsu!
Zeni!
He fell asleep so fast!
What's wrong with him?
Die!
Zenitsu!
Please, wake up!
Zenitsu!
What kind of sound is that?
This guy...
He's changed a lot!
Zenitsu...
The breath of thunder.
The first style.
Thunder and lightning!
He's dead!
He suddenly died!
What the hell?
That's enough for me!
What is this?
What is this?
What is this?
Shoichi...
Just don't say...
Thank you!
You saved my life!
I'm eternally grateful to you for that!
Why are you so happy?
You saved my life!
You saved my life!
I'm eternally grateful to you for that!
Why didn't you say you were so strong before?
What are you talking about?
Did you say something?
No.
Forget it.
Let's go.
Okay.
Damn!
He dumped me again!
What's going on in the last three days?
Damn!
To get through such a narrow building...
I'm not very good at this.
You dodged.
Apparently you're still a fresh man.
Your flesh should be beaten well.
Your own style of animal breathing.
It will be even more interesting to chop down a big target!
You dared to attack me directly!
I'll put your body on display,
and it will become a step in my path!
Third click!
Swing!
I'm attacking!
I'm attacking!
Marechi.
Marechi.
As soon as I swallow it...
50.
No, it costs hundreds of people.
I need to find more people with Marechi
and eat them.
And so...
I'll be able to get back my place among the demons of 12 moons!
Kyogai.
You can't eat anymore?
Is that all you can do?
No.
No, I'm not done yet.
Please, give me a little more time.
Enough.
I'm depriving you of your number.
This is your limit, and you've reached it.
The more people you eat, the stronger you become.
And one day, seeing your potential in me,
Master Kibutsuji shared his blood with me.
And I was able to get back my place among the demons of 12 moons.
And Master Kibutsuji shared his blood with me.
The power of the blood of this person was just incredible.
I was sure I was gonna become much stronger than before, but...
I became a member of the demons of 12 moons,
continuing to eat people with greed.
Now I believed in what could become even stronger.
I believed in it.
Brother Ieyoshi!
Brother! Brother!
Teruko!
Who's that?
My name is Kamado Tanjirou.
I came here to defeat the demons.
Now show me your wounds.
You did well to get out here alone.
Brother!
This medicine is just incredible!
My teacher gave it to me!
My teacher always wears a Tengu mask.
Tengu? Really?
Yes, it's true.
The medicine of my teacher is amazing.
It works very quickly.
That's all.
Well, doesn't it hurt anymore?
No.
What do you think? Can you tell me what happened?
The monster took me away.
And it almost ate me.
But at that moment another monster suddenly appeared.
And they started a fight to the death.
For the right to eat me.
And then...
...the one in Tsuzumi's chest...
...when another monster defeated him...
...Tsuzumi fell out of it.
When I lifted it and hit it...
...the room changed dramatically.
And I still held on somehow.
The demon in Tsuzumi's chest...
...was him.
So it was him.
Did he look like Marechi...
...or something like that?
Yes, that's right.
He kept calling me Marechi.
What kind of Marechi is a man with rare blood?
Children, I'm going to spit on you now.
Stop it.
What does rare blood mean?
The blood of all living creatures can be divided into categories, idiot.
And Marechi is special.
The rarer the blood, the demon is more valuable.
For the demon.
One man with Marechi is equal to 50 ordinary people.
Hundreds of people.
Marechi is a delicacy for demons.
For you to know, Marechi is their favorite food.
Marechi.
Marechi.
I'm leaving this room.
Calm down.
It's all right.
I'm going to defeat this demon.
Listen, Teruko.
Your brother is very exhausted right now...
...and you have to take care of him.
As soon as I leave this room...
...you'll have to take care of him.
As soon as I leave this room...
...you'll have to hit this Tsuzumi.
Just like Kiyoshi did.
If they try to open the door or you hear something...
...hit the Tsuzumi right away and run away.
I promise I'll come back to you.
I'll find you by smell.
Then I'll call your names when I open the door.
Please hold on a little longer.
You can do it.
Great.
You're very strong.
I'm going out.
Hit him!
Damn insects.
How annoying.
Tsuzumi!
Tsuzumi turns the room to the right on the right shoulder...
...and to the left on the left.
The right leg turns forward...
...and the left leg turns back.
Tsuzumi on his stomach is responsible for the claws.
So fast.
The speed of rotation is so terrifying.
Mrs. Tamaya treated my wounds.
But they haven't healed completely.
Can I beat him?
Can I?
The wounds hurt so much...
...that I can barely stand on my feet.
All this time I've been suffering this pain.
When I took Zenitsu away from that girl...
...and when I was screaming...
...I was suffering a terrible pain.
I can carry her because I'm the eldest son.
I'd give up if I were the second son.
And no matter how hard I try...
...the broken bones will crack.
I'm losing my strength.
The attacks of this demon...
...leave stripes that look like claws.
It's so scary that I can't get any closer.
Because I'm wounded...
...if I rush forward at the distance of the blow...
...my legs will be in pain.
He'll cut me into pieces.
Because of the pain, I'm thinking of evil thoughts.
Rokodaki's teacher!
Water can take any form.
Pour it into a box, it will become a cube.
Pour it into a bottle, it will become a cylinder.
Sometimes it can even crush stones...
...and run further than the eyes can see.
Right.
Exactly!
There are ten styles of water breathing.
I can fight any enemy.
If you're in pain...
...do the technique that compensates the pain.
I can take any form.
And this flow can't be stopped.
It's not just in my bones.
My heart is also broken.
Broken Tanjiru is not capable of anything!
I got it! Be so kind as to shut up!
Look only forward!
Get ready!
You can do it, Tanjiru!
You can do it!
I've been holding on for so long!
I can do it!
And not today!
Never in the future!
Even if I'm broken!
I'll never give up!
I won't give up!
