        <pre>Are you going to fight?
Is that you, Kocho?
We received information about the demon,
and the hunters who collided with him were killed.
The people and members of the squad were injured.
We can't stand aside.
Is this one of the twelve moons?
Most likely, yes.
It could be one of the highest moons.
It looks like it's a difficult task.
But if you take over Rengoku,
you have nothing to worry about.
Kocho, why did you take that tough guy into the squad?
You said you needed Tsuguku,
but I'm sure that's not the reason.
Don't worry.
I'm not going to eat him.
Well, of course.
I'm not going to eat him.
I'm not going to eat him.
I'm not going to eat him.
I'm not going to eat him.
I'm not going to eat him.
Be careful.
Be careful.
Let's go!
Episode 24
Recovering Training
No!
I can't drink it anymore!
It's the same every day.
You've hurt Zenitsu more than anyone.
Take the medicine now.
I'm serious.
Tanjiro, here's your medicine.
I'm serious.
Tanjiro, here's your medicine.
I'm serious.
Tanjiro, here's your medicine.
I'm serious.
Tanjiro, here's your medicine.
Here you go.
Thank you.
Hey!
Tanjiro's medicine is better, isn't it?
It's not like mine.
You're their favorite.
Zenitsu,
this is the hospital ward.
Calm down.
I see you're getting better.
Murata!
Hi.
I see you're getting better.
I was almost dissolved in acid,
but I survived miraculously.
I heard you got much stronger.
It looks like we're going to stay here.
It looks like we're going to stay here.
Do you have a throat problem?
What's wrong with him?
What's wrong with him?
He went through a lot,
so it's better not to bother him.
It doesn't look like him.
He's so quiet.
Tanjiro!
This is Murata.
He fought with us on the mountain of Natagumo.
Murata, nice to meet you.
Hey, your hands.
I almost turned into a spider.
My hands and legs are still short.
That's why you need to take your medicine.
That's why you need to take your medicine.
It's terrible and not tasty.
It's too nasty for a human.
Then don't talk to me if your hands don't grow.
It's cruel.
It's too cruel.
Actually, you're very lucky.
If you go out in the sun more often,
you'll fully recover.
I can't.
It's disgusting.
It can't be otherwise.
You're lucky.
Murata.
I was called to the meeting of the Hasher
to report the incident
on the mountain of Natagumo.
It was a real hell.
These Hasher are too scary.
They all hate that
the quality of the preparation of new hunters
is very low.
Because even on the mountain of Natagumo
there were those who did not follow the order.
And they said something like,
who trained them?
And why did they ask
someone of my rank about it?
Hasher,
I'm scared.
Hi.
Hasher!
Mrs. Kocho!
Hi.
Oh my God.
Bye.
How is your treatment going?
I think it's much better for us.
Really?
Let's start
your recovery training.
Recovery training?
Yes.
I'm sorry I was so weak.
Two weeks later,
Tanjiro and Inosuke
took Hasher and Mrs. Kocho
and they started recovery training.
Mrs. Shinobu's voice
is truly unique.
I don't think I've heard
something like that.
It's unusual and it's a little scary.
But when she treated people
turned into spiders,
she looked like a goddess.
They all wanted to see her
with tears in their eyes.
And she's incredibly cute.
With this appearance,
she will not disappear.
This cute lady took Tanjiro and Inosuke
to recovery training
to restore their strength.
But they
are back in this state.
Welcome back, Tanjiro and Inosuke.
How did it go today?
What happened?
What's going on?
Hey!
I'm sorry.
Don't worry.
You have to tell me!
I'm late, but I'll join you tomorrow!
No!
The next day.
I'm scared, I'm scared, I'm scared.
I don't want to go.
Okay.
Since you joined us today,
Zenitsu, I'll explain everything
from the very beginning.
Let's start with this.
Girls will help you return flexibility
after a long vacation.
Next, reflex training.
Those cups contain
water with medicine.
You need to beat the one
who sits opposite.
But if the opponent
covers your cup before you lift it,
you can't touch it.
Let's start!
Again!
Again!
Like this!
Finally, training of the whole body.
To put it simply,
it's like a game.
Your opponents will be
me, Aoi and Kanao.
Excuse me.
Can I ask you something?
Don't you understand anything?
No, just...
Let's go, you two.
We won't go.
I said shut up and come with me!
Now!
What the hell are you doing?
Sit still!
I said sit still!
You bastards!
What did you say?
Inosuke!
What the hell are you doing, Zenitsu?
Apologize to Inosuke!
You have to apologize!
How dare you behave like that!
How dare you behave like that!
As if you were in hell, not in heaven!
You were fighting with girls all day long
and looked so exhausted!
Apologize to Zenitsu!
Take care of your stomach!
What the hell are you doing?
Shut up, you bastard!
Shut up and listen!
Got it?
Girls were allowed to touch you!
You were massaged!
While playing, you touched them with your hands!
And while playing, you could touch their bodies!
Girls have breasts, buttocks and hips!
They leave behind
such a pleasant aroma
and even look at them with pleasure!
Heaven!
A real heaven!
Zenitsu, you don't understand anything!
It's a shame
to lose to someone younger than you!
Oh, poor Inosuke!
You never got along with girls!
You grew up in the mountains
and you're not mature yet!
I feel so sorry for you!
I have enough experience
with girls!
That's the worst thing you can do!
Bad, bad! You'll never have girls!
I'll have as many girls
as I want!
Train me properly!
Everything's fine!
This guy is amazing!
Even I almost cried
from the pain!
Is he laughing?
I'll take care of you!
Let's begin!
I'll never
forget the beautiful girl
from VAR!
And now
the training of the whole body!
Let's begin!
Victory!
I won the battle,
but I lost the war!
I'll show you!
Attack! Attack!
Yes!
I was the only one who lost
and got wet!
How embarrassing!
But no one could
defeat Kanao.
None of us could
cover her cup.
Especially not her.
Five days have passed,
and no one could defeat Kanao.
Just like Inosuke
and Zenitsu.
We couldn't even
touch her hair
and one day
those two stopped
training.
Zenitsu! Inosuke!
Let's begin!
Thank you
for the good training!
Why can't I
defeat her?
Why is she better than me?
First of all,
her reaction speed is much higher.
I would probably lose
even if I was healthy.
She has a completely different smell.
It smells like hashish.
Mr. Tanjirou!
And her eyes.
Her eyes are also different.
Mr. Tanjirou!
Are you all right?
We called you several times.
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.
What happened?
These are towels for you.
Thank you!
By the way, you are so kind.
Mr. Tanjirou,
do you always
hold your breath?
No.
In the morning, day and night,
and all night while you sleep,
do you always
concentrate?
No, not all the time.
I never did that.
Is it possible?
Yes.
We were told that this ability
is very important.
To use this technique
even for a short time
is quite difficult for me.
But I have to do it all day long?
Some people have already learned
this.
Please, do your best!
I see.
Thank you, I'll try.
Maybe you should
go to the training, Inosuke.
It's absolutely useless
to be angry and sorry.
Zenitsu, you should come too.
Yes, I did a good job.
Just tell them
that I got worse.
Hey, Lady Kakushi!
Would you like to have some tea with me?
Full concentration of breath.
In the morning, day and night.
Even in sleep.
I said that I would try to do it all the time.
But it's impossible!
I can't do it!
If I try to keep
full concentration of breath,
I think I'm going to die.
It hurts too much.
My lungs hurt, my ears hurt,
my ears are ringing all the time.
My ears!
I was terribly scared!
For a moment,
it seemed to me that my heart
would jump out of my ear.
I will never succeed.
If you have difficulties,
come back to the basics!
How am I destroyed?
The breath depends on the lungs.
If I can't do it,
then my lungs are too weak.
Put yourself to the full.
I can only train hard.
It was always like that.
Every day of training is important.
Step by step.
Move forward!
Yes!
Mr. Tanjir is training every day.
Yes.
Let's bring him a little anegiri.
Good idea.
What else?
Blow into these pumpkins?
Exactly.
When Mrs. Kanoa was training,
Mrs. Shinobu often told her
to blow into the pumpkins.
Really?
Interesting way of training.
Do they make any sound?
No.
She blew into them to burst the pumpkin.
Really?
Burst?
What are you talking about?
So strong?
Yes.
By the way,
this is a special kind of pumpkin.
So she is stronger than usual.
A fragile girl
could burst such a strong thing?
The stronger you become,
the more pumpkins.
Now Mrs. Kanoa
can burst
such a pumpkin.
What a huge one!
I'll try!
The next day.
They didn't come today.
I'm sorry.
I'll bring them tomorrow.
No.
You shouldn't worry about them anymore.
I'll try.
I'll try!
I repeat the exercise
that Mr. Urokodaki taught me.
I was holding my breath
with full concentration.
As I was going down the mountain,
I was running around the place.
All obstacles on the way
are trees on that mountain.
I'll try!
I'll try!
I'll try!
Fifteen days later.
I almost recovered all my strength.
And now
I can run longer than before.
My lungs have become stronger.
I have a great feeling.
I was running for a long time
and strained my lungs
with fast movements.
But now I'm breathing slowly.
With slow, deep breaths
I'm sending the air
to the tips of my fingers.
Meditation improves concentration.
Urokodaki's teacher said so himself.
Urokodaki's teacher.
How dare you
break my sword!
I'm sorry.
They're going to
break my sword again.
But I'm so sorry.
Concentrate!
Concentrate on breathing!
Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
Yes?
You're trying so hard.
Even though
your friends are resting somewhere.
Aren't you bored
by yourself?
No.
Because I learned it myself.
I can teach them too.
You have a beautiful soul.
Why did you
take us to this place?
Everyone officially found out
about the existence of Inuzuki.
And you three were seriously injured.
Also,
I would like to
trust you with my dream.
Dream?
Yes.
I dream of
making friends with demons.
I'm sure you can do it.
Are you angry?
For some reason,
you're always smiling.
Yes.
You're right.
I must be
angry all the time.
Since my favorite
older sister was killed by a demon.
Every time I saw
the tears of those
whose loved ones were killed by demons.
When I heard
the voice of despair,
anger accumulated inside me.
And it continues to grow.
In the depths of my body,
a nasty feeling
that I can't fight.
I'm sure
other Hashiro feel the same.
And now,
they saw Nezuko
who didn't eat people with her own eyes.
And they remembered her.
With respect
and desire,
thinking that someone would raise a hand on her.
My older sister
was a kind-hearted person like you.
She felt sorry for demons.
She felt sorry for them
even at the brink of death.
I didn't understand her thoughts.
How can you feel sorry
for those who kill people?
I never heard any more nonsense.
But if it's my sister's feeling,
I have to bear it.
If there is a way
not to kill these poor demons,
I have to find it.
I won't let the smile
that my sister loved so much disappear.
Sister!
Sister!
Sister!
However,
I'm a little tired.
Demons are constantly lying.
They've lost the possibility
of self-preservation.
They kill people
only by instincts.
Tanjirou,
please lie down completely.
Please protect Nezuko
until the very end.
Knowing that you're
lying down completely
brings me relief.
Now I feel much better.
Your full concentration of breath
has been interrupted.
I'll try
to fully concentrate my breath.
Hanya!
Mom, Hanako,
Takeo, Shigeru,
Rokuta!
I will definitely
turn Nezuko back into a human!
I will definitely
turn Nezuko back into a human!
I will definitely
turn Nezuko back
into a human!
I will definitely
turn Nezuko back
into a human!
I will definitely
turn Nezuko back
into a human!
I will definitely
turn Nezuko back
into a human!
I will definitely
turn Nezuko back
into a human!
I will definitely
turn Nezuko back
into a human!
I will definitely
turn Nezuko back
into a human!
I will definitely
turn Nezuko back
into a human!
I will definitely
turn Nezuko
back
into a human!
I will definitely
turn Nezuko back
into a human!
I will definitely
turn Nezuko back
into a human!
I will definitely
turn Nezuko back
into a human!
I will definitely
turn Nezuko back
into a human!
Ms. Shinobu, do you have any good news?
Yes, I got a valuable medicine.
Sniff-sniff, are you angry?
Someone keeps stealing sweets from the closet.
Sniff-sniff, and you're still sad?
I'm sad that it's not quiet nearby.
And now it's time for the secret of Taisho.
Since Aoi trained Ms. Shinobu, she can make simple medicines.
Nothing can be hidden from your nose, right, Tanjiro? Amazing.
Why is that?
Because I like talking to you, Tanjiro.
Thank you very much.
