I was able to win because I learned to feel the interlaced threads.
If I can catch that smell during the battle, I'll see the thread.
The thread connects the blade of my opponent when it slows down and stretches as soon as I notice it.
The thread leads my blade and I can strike at the right moment.
The thread connects the blade and I can strike at the right moment.
Teacher Rokodaki.
I was against you being the final contestant.
Because I don't want to see the children die.
I was sure you wouldn't be able to break this stone, but...
Good job, my boy. Tanjiro, you're an amazing child.
You have to come back alive from the final selection.
Your sister and I will be waiting for you here.
There's so much stuff here. Is there a reason?
You've completed your training. Don't be shy. Come on.
Thank you very much.
Tanjiro, I've done everything I could for you.
From now on, you'll face all the difficulties and strife yourself.
Your training will not be compared to that.
So, while you have the opportunity, you have to have a good rest.
Don't think about the fate of the world.
Hey, Tanjiro.
Oh, yeah.
Did you like the dinner?
Yeah, I haven't eaten like this in a long time.
With such an appetite, you must become stronger the more you eat, and you will grow faster.
But this also applies to demons.
Remember this. Usually, the power of the demon depends on the number of people who eat it.
So, the more they eat, the stronger they are?
That's right.
Strong demons can change their bodies and even use strange spells.
When you can improve your sense of smell, you can recognize how many people the demon has eaten.
What's that?
It's called a protective mask.
I put a spell on it to protect you from wounds and injuries.
A protective mask.
Netsuko.
I'll be right back.
No matter what happens, okay?
I'll be right back.
No matter what happens, okay?
I'll be right back.
I'll be right back.
Don't worry about your sister. I'll take care of her.
Okay. Thank you very much.
I'm going.
To Rokodaki's teacher.
Say hello to Sabita and Mom.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Say hello to Sabita and Mom.
Tanjiro, how did you...
...learn the names of these dead children?
Wow.
Just look at this glycine.
But it doesn't bloom at this time of year.
There are so many people.
We greet you...
...for coming to the final selection of demon killers today.
We thank you.
Demons are imprisoned on Mount Fujikasa.
They are captured by swordsmen, killers and demons.
And they can't leave this place.
Because demons hate them.
Glycine.
It blooms here all year round, from the foot to the half of the mountain.
However, starting from this place, there is no glycine.
And there are many demons here.
To pass the final selection...
...you need to survive for seven days.
And the final selection will begin.
And the final selection will begin.
To live seven days is the only thing I have to think about.
First, you need to survive this night.
As soon as the sun rises, the demons will not be so active.
And I can rest a little.
So you need to go east.
I'll go where the sun rises first.
This smell...
Demon.
And it's close.
Where is it?
Where does it come from?
I can't figure out where the smell comes from.
From above?
Demon.
I can't find it.
Where is it?
Where is it?
Where is it?
Where is it?
Where is it?
Where is it?
Here!
Damn you!
This is my prey, man!
Get out of the way, damn it!
Damn you! Just kill him!
Two at once?
I'll be surprised if I can handle them.
This is my prey!
Shut up!
I came first, he's mine!
Good. Just calm down and watch their movements.
Remember the training.
I haven't eaten human food for a long time.
Full concentration. Water breathing.
The smell of threads.
The fourth style.
A sudden blow.
It worked.
I beat the demons.
I got stronger.
All these trainings were not in vain.
I dedicated myself to them.
When I cut the demons with a ball that Urokodaki gave me,
I don't even have any bones left from them.
The weak point of the demon is his neck.
But you can't kill a demon with an ordinary sword,
even if you cut off his head.
Then how can I kill him?
The swords of demon hunters are forged from special steel.
Only with them can you kill a demon.
They are called nichirin blades.
Calm down.
What a terrible smell.
I'm not ready for this. I didn't sign up for this.
What's going on?
What's going on?
What's going on?
What's going on?
What's going on?
What's going on?
What's going on?
What is it?
Damn it!
Hey, Sabito.
What do you think? Can Dangerous beat him?
I don't know.
It doesn't matter how much effort he puts in, it's not enough.
You know it yourself.
What is this huge demon doing here?
We weren't told about it.
I knew it.
What the hell is happening?
Don't be afraid! Save him! Save him! Save him!
I'm not powerless anymore!
Move!
Water breathing!
Second style! Water ring!
Another little cute little fox has come to me.
Another?
Fox, what year is it now?
The Meiji era.
Now the Taisho era.
Taisho, huh?
Yeah!
The new era has already begun!
The new era!
Again! Again, I became the prisoner of this place!
Unforgivable! Unforgivable!
Damn Urokodaki! Damn Urokodaki! Damn Urokodaki! Damn Urokodaki!
How do you know Urokodaki?
How do I know him?
It was Urokodaki who caught me.
I will never forget that day 47 years ago.
And after that, he continued to hunt demons.
It was during the Edo period, the Keio era.
Hunted by demons during the Edo period?
You're lying!
Demons don't live that long!
There must be demons here who have eaten two or three people.
They are killed during the final selection, and they kill each other.
Yes, but I lived all this time.
In this gluttony trap, I ate at least 50 children.
50?
11, 12, 13 ...
You will be 14!
What are you talking about?
These are the number of children of Urokodaki that I ate.
I swore to kill all his children.
Let's see.
The one who made a special impression on me is ...
Those two.
A guy with unusual hair color.
He was the strongest.
He had pink hair.
And a scar near the mouth.
The second was a girl in a kimono with a flower pattern.
She is small and weak.
She was extremely clever.
This demon has already killed them?
But I saw them.
This mask.
These fox masks look like a mark.
I remember the texture of the masks that Urokodaki cut out.
The same pattern of thread he used for his goblin mask.
So protective masks.
Because they were wearing such, I ate them.
They are all in my stomach.
As if Urokodaki himself sent them to death.
When I told this girl, she cried and got angry.
And immediately after that, she stopped controlling her movements.
I tore off her limbs.
And then ...
Calm down, Tanjiro.
You're out of breath.
Everything is fine.
Don't think about us.
I have to get out of here while the demon is busy with this guy.
Urokodaki's child died.
I wonder what he feels when his next child does not return home.
I wonder what expression is on his face.
Oh yes, I would like to see it.
I really wanted to see it.
I want to see it.
I want to see it.
I want to see it.
Oh yes, I would like to see it.
I really wanted to see it.
Brother.
Brother!
He bowed.
So he can still move.
Great, I can have fun.
Damn.
No matter how many times I cut off his hands, they grow back again.
You can't beat me just by cutting off my hands.
And again, even that guy with pink hair could not cut off my head.
I can't let him go.
I have to beat him right now before someone else loses their lives.
The smell of demons comes from the ground.
He jumped.
Damn, I missed.
Yes, but in the air he will not be able to dodge the next attack.
Do you also think that Tanjiru will lose?
After all, he has such a strong neck.
He can lose, but he can also win.
In any case, there is one irrefutable fact.
That Tanjiru is the man who cut off the strongest big stone of all.
He slipped.
Full concentration.
Water breathing.
He got too close.
There is no point in worrying, my neck is strong.
He won't be able to cut it off.
First style.
And after he can't cut my neck, I'll break his head.
Just like I did with another child.
Water stroke.
I don't want to be trapped in sadness.
I don't want to drop my tears in a place where I look down.
Unleash the fate.
I should be able to run.
My wish should come true.
Crush yesterday's fight.
Unleash the fate.
Unleash the fate.
Unleash the fate.
Unleash the fate.
Unleash the fate.
Unleash the fate.
Unleash the fate.
Unleash the fate.
Unleash the fate.
Unleash the fate.
Unleash the fate.
Unleash the fate.
Unleash the fate.
Unleash the fate.
Unleash the fate.
Unleash the fate.
Unleash the fate.
Unleash the fate.
Unleash the fate.
Unleash the fate.
Unleash the fate.
Unleash the fate.
Unleash the fate.
Unleash the fate.
Unleash the fate.
Unleash the fate.
The End
Water Slash! How do you like it, Nezuko? Am I cool?
What? Was Saby cooler than me?
Come on, Nezuko!
Right! I saw a beautiful lily blooming around the training hall.
Then we will definitely look at it.
And now it's time for the secret of Taisho.
Belakura and a guy named Zenitsu.
I heard that he was brought here after he refused to pass the test before the selection.
Next, episode 5, my own style.
