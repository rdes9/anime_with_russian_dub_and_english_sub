There are several hundred people in the demons killing squad.
This organization is not recognized by the authorities.
However, they have existed since ancient times, and we hunt demons to this day.
Nobody knows who is in charge of the organization.
It remains a mystery.
Demons.
People are the main source of food.
They kill people and eat them.
Nobody knows when and where they came from.
They have impressive physical abilities.
Their wounds heal instantly.
Their flesh and limbs are restored, even if they are cut off.
Some demons can change their form.
Others have subversive powers.
They can only be killed by sunlight.
Or by cutting off their heads with a special sword.
The demon killers fight demons with their immortal bodies.
Since they are humans, their wounds heal slowly.
Their lost limbs are not restored.
But they still fight demons.
For the sake of the protection of other people.
Episode 3
Sabete Imakoma
I'm a teacher.
More precisely, I teach swordsmen.
There are many teachers.
And each of them teaches their students all kinds of techniques in different locations.
In order to join the demons killing squad, you have to survive the final storm.
What is happening on Mount Fuji?
The decision of your participation in the final selection remains with me.
From today I will be leading the diary for Nezuko.
Today I came down from the mountain again.
I train hard not to die during the final selection.
During the daily descent from the mountain,
I gradually learned to avoid most traps.
Because now I have become much stronger.
And because I feel the smells even better than before.
However,
traps become more and more difficult.
He really wants to kill me.
Today I came down with a sword in my hand.
But the sword significantly distorted my movements.
And with this sword, I was constantly caught in the trap.
991!
Today I waved the sword.
Well, not only today.
I wave the sword every day.
After the descent from the mountain, I wave the sword again.
Another 500!
Swords are easy to break.
That's what he told me.
A vertical blow is much stronger than a horizontal one.
Therefore,
you need to apply force right along the blade.
The direction of the blade and the direction of the applied force
should be the same.
And he added, even with a threatening tone, that
if you damage the sword,
you will not be able to break it.
Nezuko,
I will continue to work hard.
And today I was constantly falling.
This is necessary in order for me to be able to rise quickly,
regardless of how I fell.
I took the sword
and tried to hit the Urokodaki teacher.
On the other hand,
the Urokodaki teacher was without any weapons.
God, he's incredibly strong!
He was moving me in different directions,
and every time I was on the ground.
I'm back, Nezuko.
Today I practiced breathing in some techniques.
Full breathing control?
Exactly.
I will teach you all 10 forms of full breathing.
Don't forget to breathe deeply.
Then oxygen will fill every cell of your body.
This will improve your body's ability to heal,
which will stabilize and strengthen your spirit.
Relax the upper part of the body
and tense the lower part.
Good.
Breathe.
Ha-ha!
Wrong.
Next, forms.
Okay, like this.
Wrong.
Like this.
Wrong.
Like this.
Wrong.
Like this.
Wrong.
He yelled at me because I didn't tense my stomach
and started beating me on it.
Next,
he told me that I should become one with water.
Come on, jump.
Ah!
Nezuko!
Nezuko!
I'm in the water!
Meanwhile,
Nezuko has been unconscious for half a year.
The Urokodaki teacher called the doctor and let him examine her,
but he didn't find anything.
But the fact that she is still sleeping for her is not normal.
I'm afraid.
I'm afraid that one day I will wake up and see her dead.
That's why I don't have a single day without excitement.
The End
My descents are getting more and more dangerous,
and with each descent, the air becomes more discharge.
Every time I think that I can die.
The End
I have nothing more to teach you.
A year after I came to Mount Sagiri,
he suddenly told me that.
The rest is up to you.
Can you do better than I taught you?
Follow me.
The End
If you can break this balloon,
I'll let you participate in the final selection.
The End
Break this stone?
Break it with a sword?
I don't think I can do it.
The sword can break.
Urokodaki teacher!
Wait!
Urokodaki teacher!
Urokodaki teacher has not taught me anything since then.
The End
Every day I practiced what Urokodaki teacher taught me.
Even with such a basis as holding my breath and flexibility.
It's good that I recorded all this in my diary.
But even after half a year,
I still couldn't break the stone.
I was in despair.
Not enough.
My training is not enough.
I need more.
More!
I'm hopeless.
Nezuko will die without waking up.
I almost gave up.
I'm broken.
I'm working harder.
You can do it, Tanjiro!
Shut up!
A man should not whine.
It's embarrassing.
When he appeared,
and there was no smell.
A forest mask?
No matter how much you suffer,
take it out silently.
If you're a man.
If you consider yourself a man.
Slow, weak, clumsy.
A man should not be like this.
Thank you for choosing us.
What are you doing?
Rather, I would like to know what you are doing.
What do you mean?
I'm training.
How long are you going to sit on the ground
without even standing up?
Well, attack.
But you have a wooden sword,
and I have a real one.
What?
I'm bald.
Thank you for such care.
Do you really think
that you can hurt me?
Well, you have nothing to worry about.
I'm much stronger than you,
because I cut this stone.
He cut this stone?
You have not learned anything.
You have not mastered any technique.
Especially the breathing technique
that Urokodaki taught you.
Full breathing control.
He knows Urokodaki's teacher?
And breathing technique too?
You just remembered it as a fact.
You have no idea what to do.
What the hell have you been doing for a year and a half?
Burn it in your own flesh.
More.
More.
More.
So you will never forget
what Urokodaki taught you.
Hit it to the bone.
I try.
I try every day,
with all my strength.
But I don't move forward.
I can't do anything.
Then move forward.
If you're a man,
if you consider yourself a man,
there is no other way
but to move forward.
Come on.
Show me what you're capable of.
The rest is up to you.
Are you okay?
Did you see that?
What a blow!
Not a single extra move.
It was really beautiful.
I want to be like him.
Do you think I can do it?
I believed in it.
I believed in you.
I believed in you.
I believed in you.
I believed in it.
Ever since I started watching you.
She's so cute.
And who are you?
This girl's name is Makomo.
She told me that the guy's name is Sabito.
Then, when we talked,
Makomo pointed to my shortcomings.
She corrected my extra moves
and bad habits.
But when I asked why she was doing it
and where she came from,
she didn't answer me.
We both...
He and I love teacher Urokodaki very much.
And she repeated it almost all the time.
She wasn't Sabito's sister.
She said that Urokodaki raised them
after they became orphans.
Apart from us,
there are also children here.
They always look after you, Tanjirou.
Makomo is a little strange girl.
She always speaks with riddles.
Full control of the breath
accelerates the flow of blood
and the frequency of heartbeats.
This increases the temperature of your body
and gives you the power of a demon
in the form of a human.
It is very important to increase the volume of lungs.
If you fill the blood with air
and its flow accelerates,
your bones and muscles will warm up
and become stronger.
I'm not sure I understood something.
And how do I do it?
Train until you fall.
I think there is no other way.
My hands and legs were ready to fall,
and my lungs and heart were ready to explode.
But I waved the sword.
And even so,
I still couldn't beat Sabito.
Until it's been six months.
The day I challenged him,
Sabito had a real sword in his hands.
Finally, after six months,
you have become like a man.
Today I will defeat you!
In battles one-on-one, everything is quite simple.
The winner is the one who is faster and stronger.
The battle ended in an instant.
That day, that moment for the first time,
my sword hit Sabito faster than his sword hit me.
When I won,
Sabito smiled.
He looked sad and happy,
with a light smile on his face.
Tanjara,
you did well.
Don't forget what you just did.
Win, Tanjara, okay?
And that man too.
When I came to my senses,
Sabito had already disappeared.
And my sword,
with which I cut Sabito's mask,
I cut Sabito.
I cut the stone too.
I cut the stone too.
I cut the stone too.
I cut the stone too.
I cut the stone too.
I cut the stone too.
I cut the stone too.
I cut the stone too.

I cut the stone too.
I cut the stone too.
I cut the stone too.
I cut the stone too.
I cut the stone too.
Yeah! I felt shocked too.
And now it's time for the secret of Taisho.
Why does teacher Urokodaki wear a mask?
I heard it because the demons laughed at him
because of his too kind face.
Sabito, Makomo and teacher Urokodaki,
now I will work harder
to turn the tongue back into a human.
Next, episode 4, final selection.
