How?
Nezuko, don't die! Don't die at home!
I will definitely save you!
I won't let you die!
I promise my older brother will save you, no matter what!
Tanjirou!
You have your face covered in soot.
Come here.
It's dangerous to walk in such snow.
You know you don't have to.
I just want everyone to be full for the New Year.
So I have to sell more coal.
Thank you.
Brother!
Are you going back to town today?
I'll go with you!
No.
You can't go as fast as Tanjirou.
But mom!
No.
He's going without a cart today.
So he won't be able to take you when you get tired.
Brother!
I want to go with you!
I'll help you, honestly!
Thank you, Hanako.
But today you will stay at home.
You too, Shigeru.
But in return, I'll bring you a bunch of sweets, okay?
Really?
Yeah.
And Hanako, I'll read it to you as soon as I get back.
Okay.
Good girl.
Thank you very much, Tanjirou.
You're welcome.
Okay, then I'll go.
Takeo.
Could you cut more wood along the way?
Okay, I'll do it.
But...
I hope we'll do it together.
Of course, of course.
What did you find?
You turned red, Takeo!
Hey, shut up!
It's okay.
I said stop!
Come back soon!
Be careful!
Brother!
Nesuko!
I was taking care of Rokuto.
Otherwise, he would have become capricious.
He is very lonely after his father's death.
And everyone follows you wherever you go.
See you soon!
Our life is not easy, but we are happy.
But everything can suddenly change, like the weather.
It changes and moves.
The sun does not always shine, but the snow does not go forever.
And when trouble comes, it always smells like blood.
Is this really Tanjirou?
I can't believe you came down from the mountain in such weather.
You're such a hard worker.
You can catch a cold.
Really, it's not worth it.
What about the coal?
Do you have enough?
Hey, Tanjirou!
Can I have some coal?
Thank you for fixing my door that time.
I also need coal.
Tanjirou!
Oh, just in time!
I was accused of breaking this plate.
Can you help me?
Smell it!
It smells like a cat.
See?
Oh, so it was a cat?
I told you it wasn't me!
Hey, Tanjirou!
Can you help me with this plate?
God, it's already so late.
Although I'm glad I sold everything.
Hey, Tanjirou!
Are you going back to the mountains?
No, it's too dangerous.
I have a great sense of smell.
Everything will be fine.
You can stay with me for the night.
Come on, come in.
But...
Don't argue, come in!
Until the demons appear.
Thank you for the dinner.
Listen, Grandpa Saburo.
What are these demons?
Demons and cannibals always go hunting
when it gets dark.
That's why it's dangerous to walk at night.
If you've eaten, go to bed.
And if you've eaten, go to bed.
If you've eaten, go to bed.
And tomorrow morning you'll go home.
These demons can't enter your house.
No, they can.
In that case, everyone will be eaten by demons.
That's why hunters for demons kill them,
protecting us from a long time ago.
That's all for today.
Good night.
The old man Saburo
has been living alone since he lost his whole family.
He must be lonely.
Next time I'll bring my brothers and sisters.
And I'll tell him, you shouldn't be afraid,
there are no demons here.
You're safe.
But still,
my grandmother said the same thing
when she was still alive.
Be careful.
Okay.
When trouble comes,
it's always
the smell of blood.
Nezuko!
What happened?
What's going on?
What happened here?
Mom!
Mom!
Hanako!
Takeo!
Takeo!
Shigeru!
Nezuko!
Rokuto!
Only Nezuko is still warm.
If we take her to the doctor,
she can survive.
How could this happen?
Was it a bear?
Was it a bear that didn't fall into the stove?
I can't breathe.
The air is so cold.
My lungs hurt.
Keep walking!
Come on, move your legs!
We still have a long way to go to the city.
Faster!
I won't let you die.
I promise I'll save you.
I promise my older brother will save you.
Oh, no!
Thank God!
I fell into the snow.
I slipped and fell into the snow.
Nezuko!
Nezuko!
Are you okay?
You shouldn't go!
I'll take you to the city, okay?
Nezuko!
She is...
a demon!
I just remembered what the old man Saburo told me.
Nezuko is a demon-monster?
It can't be!
Nezuko was a human from birth.
However, she no longer smells like Nezuko,
whom I know.
But Nezuko didn't behave like that.
She was lying as if protecting Rokuto,
and there was no blood on her lips and hands.
And there was another...
another smell.
She's only gotten bigger.
She's getting stronger and stronger.
While I was sleeping carelessly in Saburo's house,
they were all killed so brutally.
It must have been painful.
You suffered.
I'm sorry I couldn't save you.
If I could at least help Nezuko...
But she's too strong!
I can't resist her!
Nezuko!
Hold on, Nezuko!
Don't give up!
Try to fight it!
Don't turn into a demon!
You have to be strong!
Hold on!
You can do it!
NEZUKO
NEZUKO
What's going on?
Who's that?
A sword?
Why are you protecting her?
She's my sister!
She's my younger sister!
Nezuko!
You call that your younger sister?
Nezuko!
Nezuko!
Don't move.
Killing demons is my job.
Should I say that I'm going to behead your sister?
Wait!
Nezuko didn't kill anyone!
There was another smell I hadn't heard of before.
Maybe it was the smell of the one who killed my family.
It wasn't Nezuko.
I don't know why she turned into that, but...
But still...
It's pretty simple.
She turned into a demon because her wounds got her blood.
That's how many demons there are.
Nezuko never ate people!
Are you kidding me?
They barely ate you.
You're wrong!
I'm sure she knows who I am!
I won't let her hurt anyone!
I'll turn Nezuko back into a human!
I swear I'll cure her!
There's no medicine.
It's impossible to turn a demon back into a human.
I'll find a way!
Please!
Please don't kill her!
I'll find the one who killed my family!
I'll take care of everything!
Please!
Please!
Don't do this!
Please...
Don't take her away from me!
I beg you!
Please!
Don't kill my sister!
Please, don't!
Please!
Please!
Please don't let anyone else have a chance to kill you!
Stop sitting in this humiliating position!
If you didn't let this happen,
your family wouldn't be dead!
Can a weakling who's in such a situation
cure your sister?
Find the enemy?
Don't make me laugh!
There's no right or choice!
Their fate is to be mercilessly crushed by the strong!
Maybe demons know how to cure your sister.
However, I don't think demons will listen to your requests or wishes.
And of course, I'm not going to either.
It's a reality.
Why did you give up on your sister earlier?
Why did you try to protect her?
Why didn't you use the axe?
Why did you open my back?
All these mistakes led to your sister being captured!
I could have taken her with you!
Don't cry.
Don't despair.
It's not the time for that.
I understand that you're broken.
Your whole family was killed, and your sister turned into a demon.
I know it hurts.
I know you want to scream.
I understand.
If I had come here earlier,
your family might not have been dead.
But the time has come to turn back.
Get angry.
Let the strong, pure anger and what is unforgivable
become an unwavering desire to act.
With hasty decisions,
you won't be able to protect or cure your sister.
Should I take revenge for the death of my family?
No!
Stop!
A direct attack based on emotions.
Stupid!
Where is his axe?
Before I could hide behind a tree,
he threw a stone at me,
and at the same time,
he threw an axe at me.
He threw an axe at me.
He threw an axe at me.
He threw an axe at me.
He threw an axe at me.
He threw an axe at me.
He threw an axe at me.
He raised his hands as if he was preparing for a blow,
so I didn't notice he was unarmed.
He knew he couldn't defeat me.
He tried to overcome me
after I killed him.
This guy...
Damn!
She will eat him!
Nezuko!
It wasn't Nezuko!
She never ate people!
A long time ago,
someone said the same thing,
and then the demon ate him.
When the demon is hungry,
he can eat even his relatives.
After all, they are very nutritious.
I've seen this countless times.
This girl is wounded,
and spends energy on healing wounds.
It must be that she has exhausted her strength
and turned into a demon.
This means that now she is terribly hungry.
It must be that now she wants to eat a person,
even if it's her brother.
But she protects him
and even scares me.
I wonder
if they can be different from others.
I'm sorry I left you, Tanjirou.
Take care of Nezuko.
Are you awake?
Go to the old man named Sakonji Urokodaki,
who lives at the foot of Yagara Sagiri.
Tell him that you sent me Okagi.
It's cloudy now,
so everything should be fine.
But never let her go out in the sun.
THE END
Let's go.
