Episode 19
Hinokami
Amazing!
His power of strikes is on a completely different level!
He's way above his head!
He's cut through the whole world!
Amazing, amazing, amazing, amazing!
Who's this guy?
I've got goosebumps all over my body!
Wait a second!
Fight me, funny Haori!
You've overcome me!
You've overcome me!
Wait a second!
Fight me, funny Haori!
You've overcome me!
You've overcome me!
And if I overcome you...
I will be considered the strongest!
You should go to the gym.
Idiot.
What?
You've never been a demon.
I couldn't even understand that.
But I did it!
I didn't think that it was the destruction of the Demon 12 Elons!
This dancer decided that he is the Demon 12 Elons!
And what about me?
I just repeated his words!
What's going on?
He tied me up!
Quick, quick guy.
Hey, you! Come back!
You'd better not get into the battle if you don't understand how seriously wounded I am.
I can't hear anything!
And your voice is soft!
And you're so fast!
Wait, who are you talking to?
Untie me now!
Hey, guy!
Hello!
Hey!
Are you okay?
Grandpa...
Who did you call grandpa?
I just saw Grandpa.
He told me not to give up.
Your whole life has been spent in front of your eyes.
There is an opinion that a person is looking for a way to avoid death.
And that's why he begins to see such images.
Do you remember all your experience?
But I'm sure I can't be sure, because I haven't experienced it personally.
Yes, you did a lot of work slowing down the process of spreading the poison.
If you hadn't slowed down the poison, you would have turned into a spider a long time ago.
Let me inject you with an antidote.
Quick! Here, here!
We need to take them off.
Be careful.
It's okay. They're still alive.
My blade is broken.
I can't believe my eyes!
The threads of this boy...
Are they stronger than the body of the demon that I couldn't cut?
I'm sorry, teacher Rokodaki, Mr. Naganezuka.
Because of my inexperience, the blade is now broken.
No! Now is not the time to be sad!
Think! Think!
Break and don't cut!
I'll send them straight to his face!
No!
This is bad!
The threads are alive, and I can't break through them!
Even though he's holding back not to kill me.
But he still surpasses me!
Well, are you still refusing to take back your words?
Okay, then I'll cut you into pieces.
I won't back down!
Nezuko!
Nezuko! Nezuko!
You protected me!
I'm sorry!
The girl came out of the box that was behind his shoulders.
She has a demon aura.
You...
This...
This girl...
Your family...
And what's wrong with that?
The wound is deep.
Her left wrist is about to fall off.
Hurry up and heal!
Hurry up and heal!
Family... family...
His sister was turned into a demon.
But she didn't betray him.
The younger sister protected her brother, risking her life.
This is the true connection!
I want it!
Wait a minute!
Please, wait!
I'm your older sister!
Don't leave me!
Shut up!
We're not fighting!
Don't you ever come here again!
Or I'll kill you!
Or I'll kill you!
No!
I won't let you go!
No!
No!
No!
No!
Don't do it!
No!
No!
Please, don't!
I'll forgive you all your sins.
Got it.
I'll kill them all.
Boy.
Hey, boy.
Let's talk.
Come out, come on.
Boy?
Let's talk?
You see, I...
I'm very touched.
From your sister, I have goosebumps.
There is no word to describe how touched I am.
But now you just have to die from my hand.
It would be sad if it happened right now.
But I have one suggestion.
A suggestion that will help you avoid death.
Your younger sister.
Give me your younger sister.
If you give her at your own will, I will spare you.
I have no idea what you're talking about right now.
From today on, your younger sister will be mine.
You don't think I'll really agree, do you?
Not to mention that Nezuko is not a thing.
She has her own will.
And she will never become your sister.
Come on.
Don't worry so much.
I'll create a connection between us.
I'm stronger than you.
I'm talking about real horror.
I'll show you what happens if you decide not to obey.
Enough with your nonsense!
To scare someone to tie to yourself?
The devil is a family knot!
Until you get such a simple thing.
God, you're so annoying.
Can you please stop yelling?
It looks like we don't understand each other.
I will never give you Nezuko.
Well, okay.
I'll finish you off and take it myself.
But first, I'll cut off your head.
What a fighting spirit!
I'm not afraid of you.
I'm not afraid of you.
What a fighting spirit!
I'll be glad to look at your
I'm not afraid of you.
I'm not afraid of you.
I'm not afraid of you.
I'm not afraid of you.
I'm not afraid of you.
I'm not afraid of you.
I'm not afraid of you.
I'm not afraid of you.
I'm not afraid of you.
I'm not afraid of you.
I'm not afraid of you.
I'm not afraid of you.
I'm not afraid of you.
I'm not afraid of you.
Your role is to give your sister to me and disappear.
Otherwise, you just have to die.
After all, you can't beat me.
The fifth Nishia Luna.
I knew it.
His power.
This child is a demon of 12 moons.
I just can't cut through his threads.
What to do?
The blade is broken, too.
If his neck is stronger than the threads.
I don't like your look.
You're too wrinkled.
You're such a fool.
Do you really think you can beat me?
Take this!
Great.
I took the girl.
Now do you understand what your role is?
Let her go!
I said I'd leave you alive, and you just challenge me.
Nishia Luna.
Nezuko's gone!
Nezuko!
Stop screaming. You're not going to kill her that easily. She's a demon after all.
But you have to teach her a very important lesson. Let her bleed while she's at it.
If she still doesn't learn to obey, I'll leave her hanging until noon.
Let her fry.
Nezuko!
Nezuko!
Let her go!
You... maybe I'm wrong, but...
You don't think you can cut my head off, even if you get a little closer.
But okay, you can try.
The blade... doesn't go through.
What? Didn't I tell you?
You have no chance against me.
My body is stronger than any of the threads I control.
If you can't even cut the threads, what are you talking about my neck?
It's... it's strong.
It's much stronger than any demon I've ever faced.
It's a demon... 12 Elons.
So that's the power of the Kibutsuji demon.
Maybe you'll shut up. You're screaming too loud.
Stop it!
Now I'm your older brother. How much more are you going to whine?
Calm down. Don't give in to emotions. Otherwise, I'll just play him in the hand.
Did you really cut yourself off? Or are you asleep?
This demon has an unusual aura. How does it differ from ours?
Interesting.
Concentrate.
Breath under control.
Use the most accurate and final style.
Full concentration!
You didn't even realize how weak your attacks were.
I'll show you.
Here's your breath.
10th style.
Unchangeable flow.
I did it. I cut the threads.
It's problematic to gain power with every turn.
I can do it. If I get closer, I can beat him.
Listen, didn't you think I was using the strongest weapon?
The art of demonic blood. The cage of threads.
I don't need you anymore. Goodbye.
It's bad. I can't cut through them.
I can't turn around.
They have a completely different smell.
But I must not lose.
I lost.
I lost.
I...
Father!
Tanjirou.
Breathe.
Take control of your breath and become Hinokami.
Tanjirou.
Look.
Your father is dancing Kagura.
Our family works with fire.
And in order to avoid injuries and disasters,
we perform Hinokami dance and pray in the New Year.
Listen, mom.
Hmm?
Your father is so weak.
How can he perform his dance in the snow for so long?
My lungs have been covered with ice for a long time.
There is a breathing technique.
A technique that no matter how much you move, you will not get tired.
Technique?
Yes.
If you learn to breathe correctly, you will be able to dance forever.
You will not feel cold at all.
Tanjirou,
make sure that the dance of Kagura and these earrings
will be passed on to the next generation.
This is the promise I made.
Hinokami Kagura!
Dance!
Niti.
Don't stop!
You have to run!
If I stop,
there will be serious consequences from the change of water breathing to the breathing of Hinokami.
And then,
for some time I will not be able to move.
Therefore,
there will be no other chance.
Run!
You have to protect Nazuko!
Nishika!
I see a white thread!
I need to destroy it now!
Even if
I am cut off by his threads!
Nazuko,
wake up,
Nazuko.
Save your brother.
I know you can do it,
Nazuko.
Hold on.
Please,
Nazuko.
Otherwise, your brother will also be killed.
The art of demonic blood!
The explosion of blood!
It can't be!
Niti burned and broke!
Connection between us and Nazuko!

The End
Thanks to him, I even broke the demon's neck with a broken blade, and thanks to you, Nezuko.
This week, I will tell you the secret of Taisho, the Kamado family.
After each festival, Mom and Dad prepared rice toasts for us.
They were so crispy, truly wonderful moments.
Thanks, Nezuko. It's not time to give up on memories.
Next, episode 20. The Prey Family
Did I really destroy the demon of the twelfth moon?
