If I get it, it will speed up the creation of the medicine that can turn Nezuko.
That's right! Inosuke!
So you beat her!
Are you okay, Inosuke?
I'm asking you, did you beat her or not?
Yes, I beat her.
You beat her?
Yes, I beat her.
You beat her?
Did you beat her or not?
Yes, I beat her.
Inosuke, how are you?
Don't surround me with your care and kindness!
Did you hear me?
After all, everything you can do, I can do too!
And besides, my head will be stronger than yours!
And also...
And also...
He's seriously injured.
I couldn't save any of the guys.
That woman smelled of horror and suffering.
And it was enough for her to thirst for death.
What happened on this mountain?
Stay calm, Inosuke!
Stop it, Inosuke!
Stay calm, Inosuke!
Stay calm, Inosuke!
Stay calm, Inosuke!
Stay calm, Inosuke!
Inosuke!
Great job!
Happy New Year!
Go away!
Great job!
Great.
Great.
Great.
Now what to do, Inosuke?
What did you do to him?
What did I do to him?
I'm sure the spiders are trying to survive, too, but still!
Ah! Calm down! Stop!
Is this even possible?!

Whoa!
Whoa, guys!
It's huge, it's huge, it's huge!
Damn, it's huge â€“ it's too big!
You know what? I'm gonna have a message from someone like you!
You've already lost.
What are you talking about?
I don't want to hear it! Don't talk to me!
I don't like people like you, got it?
You've already understood how dangerous your position is.
What are you talking about?
Look at your hands.
What? Hands?
What's wrong with my hands?
What's that?
It's poison.
The spider bit you, didn't it?
This poison can turn you into a spider.
In 30 minutes you'll be my slave crawling on the ground.
Look, this is a clock.
Do you understand?
When the long arrow makes a full turn,
you will become a member of the spider clan.
And when the arrow is here,
your lungs will start to twitch and hurt.
And when it's here,
you'll feel dizzy and nauseous.
Then you'll feel a lot of pain.
Your body will start to shrink, and you'll disconnect.
And by the time you wake up...
Run!
Is it useless?
Yes, yes, yes!
I know already!
I know!
What are you doing?
I'm running!
Run!
Run!
Run!
Run!
Run!
Run!
Run!
Run!
Run!
Run!
Run!
Run!
Run!
Run!
What are you doing?
Shut up!
Just shut up!
You have nothing to be afraid of.
When the poison gets in your body,
you'll become a spider,
you'll lose your mind.
No!
That's exactly what I don't like!
How do you not understand?
I have no friends, no girlfriend,
nobody loves me!
Huh?
Apparently you need an additional dose of poison
to turn you into faster.
No!
No!
I don't want to become like that!
Get a grip!
Stop crying!
Stop running!
It won't help you at all!
Zenitsu!
Get down from there!
We'll continue training!
But not this!
I'm sure I'll die if I keep training!
I'm definitely going to die, so...
You won't die!
Especially from this!
Get down, you fool!
Grandpa!
Call me a teacher!
But I love you, Grandpa!
When the girl I loved
got dirty in my debts and ran away with someone else,
you saved me from a bunch of my debts!
Although maybe you just wanted to grow up a swordsman.
Nevertheless, I want to make up for your expectations!
But I can't!
I feel terrible because of who I am!
So you know, I train on my own!
And I don't sleep at all!
But it doesn't bring any results!
And what does it mean?
What kind of nonsense are you talking about?
Calm down, Zenitsu!
You have talent!
Enough of me!
Zenitsu!
What kind of luck is this?
I was hit by lightning.
The color of my hair has changed.
Of course, I was grateful
that I survived, but...
I...
I hate myself more than anyone else.
I always thought I had to do everything right.
But I was always afraid, running away,
and crying.
I want to change.
I want to become a worthy person.
Look!
I'm trying my best!
But why do I have to become a monster in the end?
It can't be true! It's a lie!
What's wrong with this guy?
Damn! Don't get in here!
Leave me alone for a minute!
Just for one minute!
My hair is falling out.
My hair is falling out.
And this asshole didn't even warn me about it!
Who is this guy?
Isn't he a demon hunter
who came here to kill our family?
Lost consciousness?
God, he's so cowardly!
Okay, he'll fall on his head and die.
What the hell?
The breath of thunder.
The first style.
Poisonous slime!
Poisonous slime!
He's spinning in the air to dodge?
What a quick move!
He's become a different person.
The breath of thunder.
The first style.
Hey, guys!
Attack him!
The breath of thunder.
The first style.
He uses the same stance over and over again.
This guy can't make mistakes.
He's only capable of this attack.
It's all right, Zedis.
It's not bad for you.
You've mastered the technique, and this is a reason to celebrate.
If you can only use it, bring it to perfection.
Work on it until you reach your limit.
But, Grandpa, you were very angry recently.
Because Grom's breathing includes three styles, and I only mastered one.
Do you know how to forge a sword?
I have no idea. You're going to beat me all the time.
I'm going to cry now.
Speaking of swords, this is what you've been hitting and hitting and hitting
to get rid of the impurities and increase the purity of the blade
that will make the beginning of a strong sword.
That's why you beat me every day, so I can finally understand it.
But I'm not made of steel, am I?
I'm made of blood and flesh.
You can't even imagine the threat, and you call yourself a demon hunter?
At any moment, this poison will paralyze you.
Zenitsu, perfect it.
Crying is normal, and running away is normal, too.
But never give up.
Just believe.
You've gone through hellish training.
You will be rewarded.
Bring it to the limit.
Become the strongest sword of all.
Bring it to perfection.
Fail.
Don't make me repeat. Fail.
You know what I'm talking about.
And how can you not be ashamed to cry from morning to evening and all the time?
Fail.
All the time was spent on you in vain.
The teacher, however, is an extraordinary person.
But Grandpa said...
Grandpa? Don't call him like that, as if you're very close to him.
The teacher of the former Hasher,
the man who received the highest rank in the hunting squad.
Almost no one has a chance to learn from the former Hasher.
The time that the teacher spent on your training was just in vain.
Don't blur my eyes. Get out.
Why are you still here?
What the hell are you standing here for?
I never had parents, so no one has any hope for me.
There is no one who would dream that one day I would at least achieve something.
That I can be useful.
That I can protect someone.
And make someone happy, at least once in a lifetime.
A modest future like this.
No one wanted me to do that.
When I was crying and running away,
they said,
Oh, this guy is useless.
And they left.
But not Grandpa.
Again and again.
He was constantly scolding me.
Every time I ran away.
Again and again.
He was returning me.
He beat me up so many times.
But he never left me.
Poke him.
Give him even more poison.
We'll do it for him.
What is this?
The air is vibrating.
Breathing is loud.
First style.
Thunder and lightning.
Six skips.
Six skips.
Six skips.
Six skips.
He disappeared.
They cut me?
They cut me?
He?
Such a guy like him?
But this is absurd.
A guy who barely moves his hands and feet.
Stop!
I see a dream.
It's a beautiful dream.
I'm strong.
Stronger than anyone.
I can help the weak and those who are in trouble.
At any time.
Everything my grandfather taught me.
All the time he spent on me.
It was not in vain.
A dream in which thanks to my grandfather.
I became strong.
And helped many people.
But now everything is over.
What the hell?
I am very sorry.
Never give up!
Never give up.
Never give up.
Use breathing technique to slow down the action of poison.
Even if it hurts.
Even if it's difficult.
Do not look for easy ways.
Or grandfather will beat you again.
Exactly.
And Tanjiru will scream at you.
What was that sound?
It was a lightning strike.
How should I know?
But I do not feel the smell of thunder clouds.
The sharp smell has intensified and I can not say for sure.
Inosuke!
I think I need to go there.
Go and do what you want.
Will you go down, Inosuke?
Will you go down the mountain?
What is it?
Let's fight!
No.
You're seriously injured.
I'm not injured at all.
No, Inosuke.
Just your wounds.
Anyone will see them.
Demon!
Because of the smell of the whole mountain.
I could not track him down.
I'll tear you to pieces!
Damn demon!
Come here!
Inosuke!
Father!
Who do you call your father?
Inosuke!
Do not come near my family!
Get out of here!
I leave the rest to you, father.
Water breathing!
Second style!
Water ring!

Unified Middle and Senior School of the History of the Academy of Demon Hunters
The day of perfection starts early in the morning.
I would give up everything.
But there is one thing that stops me.
And that is...
Checking the school uniform!
I can look at the girls as much as I want and they will not shout at me.
Nezuko!
Makoma is also cute today.
And this teacher is also great.
Mr. Domioka!
This is not what you thought.
This is just a check of the uniform.
Before looking for flaws in someone else's uniform, deal with your hair.
But they are natural!
Next, episode 18.
Lies and lies.
But this is my natural color.
