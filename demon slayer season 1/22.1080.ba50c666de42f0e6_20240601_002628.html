Hey, I said, wake up! Get up! Hey! Hey, you! Come on! Come on! I've been thinking about sleeping all day! Wake up, damn it!
Oh, Blom, I heard that this hunter travels with a demon, and I expected to see someone brighter than this boring guy.
And now we will judge him!
Everything is clear!
If you consider that he defended his sister who became a demon, what a strong brotherly love! How brave!
Who are these people?
Don't open your mouth when the bastard is thinking! Who do you think is in front of you now? You are in the presence of the Hasher!
Hasher? What kind of Hasher? What is he talking about? And who are all these people?
Where am I?
This is the demon hunter's headquarters. And the court is waiting for you soon.

Episode 22 The Owner of the House
Before we start the trial, tell us about the crime you committed.
There is no need in the court!
The protection of the demon! This is an obvious violation of the rules! We can decide everything ourselves! This is our right! We will behead him together with the demon!
In this case, I will be glad to cut off his head! I will show you the brightest fountain of blood in your life! I say as bright as possible!
What? Are you going to kill such a cute child? My heart is bursting with pain, real torment!
God, how sad it is! What a poor child! How sad that he was born in this world!
What was the shape of that cloud? What is its name?
Where is Nezuko? Nezuko!
Hey, you! They call me Hasher. Where are you looking? These are the ten most high-ranking swordsmen among the demon hunters.
Hasher?
Let's get rid of their suffering.
Yes, let's make it bright.
Hey!
Nezuko! Nezuko, where are you? Nezuko! Zenitsu! Inosuke! Murata!
Forget it. What are we going to do with Tamioka?
My head hurts from the fact that he stands here like this.
Judging by the words of Kocho, Tamioka also violated the rules of the detachment.
How are we going to do with him? How are we going to make him answer for Sadeine? What kind of lesson are we going to teach him?
Hey, Nezuko!
Because of me, even Tamioka!
Egor, are you as persistent as a snake?
I love your persistence!
Egor, I love you!
I love you!
I love you!
I love you!
I love you!
I love you!
I love you!
I love you!
I love your persistence!
Tamioka is standing there all alone.
How cute!
So what about the punishment? He followed me without resistance.
Let's think about the punishment later.
I'm much more interested in hearing the story of this boy.
The reason why he was on a mission with a demon, despite the fact that he is a hunter.
I want to hear an explanation from him himself.
Of course, his actions violate the rules of the detachment of hunters for demons.
You know about it, don't you?
Komada Tanjara.
Why are you traveling with a demon, being a hunter?
No need for questions!
Don't rush. Just tell us why.
She's mine! She's mine!
She's mine!
She's mine!
She's mine!
She's mine!
She's my younger!
I suppose you should get a drink.
You have a damaged jaw. Please, drink slowly.
It has painkillers, so you'll feel better.
It won't heal your wounds, so don't overdo it.
And now, Team Tanjir.
That demon is my younger sister.
Until I was at home, a demon attacked my family.
And when I came back, everyone was already dead.
My sister was turned into a demon, but she didn't eat anyone.
She never ate, and never will.
She will never, and will never harm people.
Don't make careless statements.
She's from your family.
She's from your family, and it's clear that you're protecting her.
I don't believe a single word you say, and I don't believe you.
Oh, she's possessed by a demon.
Let's kill the poor child and get rid of her suffering.
Listen, please.
I became a swordsman to cure Nezuko.
It's been two years since Nezuko became a demon.
And in all this time, she hasn't eaten a single person.
You're saying the same thing to us, idiot.
It's not a fact that she hasn't eaten anyone, and will never eat.
No need for empty words.
Prove it to us with maximum brightness.
What kind of bird is this?
This is...
I'm sorry.
I have my own guesses.
I can't imagine how the Lord could not know about this situation.
Can we do something with him without his permission?
Shouldn't we wait for him?
My sister...
My sister will fight on my side.
She can protect people like hunters.
So...
So, there's something interesting going on here.
So, is it you, that idiot who's hanging out with the demon?
And what are you going to do next?
Shinodugawa, you have even more scars. It's amazing.
You can't do that, Mr. Shinodugawa.
Could you put this box down, please?
Shinobu is angry.
It's rare to see her like this. She's so cool.
Shinodugawa, don't act alone.
What did you say about this demon, boy?
That she can protect people like hunters, right?
You know what we think.
It's impossible to be stupid.
Whether he's a hunter or not,
I won't let anyone hurt my sister.
Really? That's good.
Stop! The Lord will be here soon.
Shinobu!
I'm sorry.
Damn it!
Even though you interfered with Miyoko,
he still hit Shinodugawa.
If you don't see the difference between good and bad demons,
you should leave the Hasher's ranks!
Oh, you little...
I'll kill you!
The Lord has arrived.
It's good that you came.
My dear children.
The Manilibria.TV project has been announced.
Thank you for choosing us.
The Lord has arrived.
The Manilibria.TV project has been announced.
Thank you for choosing us.
The Lord has arrived.
Good morning, everyone.
The weather is surprisingly good today.
I wonder, is the sky blue?
I'm glad that after a whole six months
our Hasher's meeting is going on without changing its composition.
Is he wounded?
No, is he sick?
No, he's not.
Is he injured?
No, he's not.
Is he wounded?
No, is he sick?
Does that mean this man is the Lord?
He's so fast!
I didn't even have time to react!
Oh, this...
I'm glad to see you in good health, Lord.
I pray for your well-being.
I thank you, Sanemi.
I wanted to say this.
I wanted to say hello to the Lord.
I'm sorry, Sanemi.
I'm sorry, Sanemi.
I'm sorry, Sanemi.
I'm sorry, Sanemi.
If you don't mind, Lord...
Before we start the Hasher meeting,
will you tell us more about this swordsman,
the Tanjir command, who travels with demons?
You won't say he's very smart and rational,
but he's being very polite right now.
I see.
I'm very sorry to surprise you.
As for Tanjiru and Nezuko, I know about this situation.
And I'd like you to accept it.
Even if it's your decision, sir, I can't just accept it.
I'm also very much against it.
I can't accept a hunter traveling with a demon.
I'll do whatever you want, sir.
I don't care.
I'll forget about it right away.
I don't trust them.
I hate demons first.
Sir, even though I respect you to the core of my soul,
this is an incomprehensible decision.
I'm definitely against it.
The task of the hunter squad is to destroy the demons.
I'm for the punishment for Kamada and for Tamiyoki.
A letter, please.
Yes.
This letter is from the former Hasher, Sakonji Urakadake.
I'll read a brief version for you.
Please, let Tanjiru travel with his sister, the demon.
Thanks to her unbending will,
Nezuko didn't lose her human emotions.
Even when she was hungry, she never ate people.
And it remains in her eternal pain for two years later.
Perhaps this situation will seem dubious to you, but it's true.
If Nezuko attacks a human,
Kamada Tanjiru and...
Sakonji Urakadake and Tamiyoki Gyo will argue with each other.
And what if they argue with each other?
If you want to die, let them rot!
This doesn't guarantee anything.
Shinatsugawa is right.
I don't want to die.
I don't want to die.
I don't want to die.
I don't want to die.
I don't want to die.
I don't want to die.
I don't want to die.
I don't want to die.
Tamiyoki Gyo!
What did you say?
She didn't have anyone.
He'sories?
So, the divine will is praying for a divine person...
...who is for sure bloodthirsty and good.
So, who was that?
The truth is that Nezuko lived for more than two years without eating people.
And for her sake, three people risk their lives.
In order to avoid this decision, his opponents must provide more weighty arguments.
Are you all ready to do this?
Besides, my children, I want to tell you something.
Tanjirou met Kibutsuji in the monastery.
No, it's impossible! No one from the Hasher has ever crossed paths with him!
So this guy, what does he look like, what does he know, and where is he?
Did you fight him?
Kibutsuji, what did he do?
Did you find him in the monastery?
Hey, answer me!
Shut up! I asked first!
First, tell me about the Kibutsuji mass!
Kibutsuji sent demons for Tanjirou.
Although he wanted to hide in this way,
now that Kibutsuji showed up for the first time, I don't want to let him go.
And I also think that Kibutsuji did not expect what happened to Nezuko.
Do you understand?
No, I don't understand, sir.
If she were a human, I would let her live, but not a demon!
Only not after all that the hunters went through in the battles,
not after how many lives people lost!
This is unacceptable!
What are you doing? What are you doing?
You're going to stain the garden!
Sir, I'll show you the ugly creature of a demon!
Boys...
Hey, demon, are you ready to eat? Enjoy!
Don't hold back!
Show your true nature, and I'll behead you in place!
Nezuko!
Shinetsugawa, nothing will work out in the light.
We need to go into the shade, otherwise the demon will not appear.
Sir, forgive me for my rudeness.
Stop!
Come out, demon!
Look, this is your favorite human blood!
I can't breathe, and I can't move either!
Stop!
Nezuko!
Nezuko!
Nezuko!
Nezuko!
Episode 4
Just imagine, Shinetsugawa was hit by a newbie's head.
It was a strong blow to the head!
Yes, the sound was bright.
It must be painful for Amida Butsu.
But the way he held himself in front of the husher was so brave!
Did you come to chat? I would have turned around if Tamioka had not interfered with me.
Excuses, excuses.
I see that you have not changed.
And now it's time for the secret of Taisho.
The one who speaks the fastest will greet the master.
Therefore, we all have butterflies in our stomach while we are waiting for the master.
Next, episode 23. Husher meeting.
