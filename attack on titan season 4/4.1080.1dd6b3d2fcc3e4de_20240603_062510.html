        <pre>Falko, where are you going so late?
I forgot something, so I have to run back.
I'm sorry.
Falko, can you do me a favor?
What is it, Mr. Kruger?
I need to send a letter.
But in the boarding area, mail is always checked.
Really?
I don't want it to be revealed that I'm a simulator.
You can send it outside the ghetto.
No problem. Is this for your family?
Yes. I want them to know where I am and that I'm fine.

Hand in hand
THE END
Hey, what's going on?
The Tiber family and Sveta have already arrived.
So early?
They are not from the Marley army.
This is the personal guard of the Tiber family.
Come in.
Sorry for the surprise.
I am the current head of the Tiber family, Willi.
I am the commander of the Teo-Mogat squad.
It is an honor for me to meet you, Lord Tiber.
Likewise, Commander Mogat.
And now let me introduce you to my family.
Stop it!
You are the commander of the soldiers since the moment of their formation.
You already know who is the carrier of the giant hammer.
No, I have no idea.
I don't even know the true reason for your arrival.
Rumors do not lie, you are a prophet.
The carrier is here now.
The power of the giant hammer is with one of us.
And I am here to look at the statue of Helos.
Hundreds of years ago, an ordinary man conquered the demons of the Earth.
He saved the world and became the pride of the Marley people, the hero Helos.
He is magnificent.
Beauty and valour, not a single flaw.
Yes, the true embodiment of the Marley spirit.
Yes, that's right.
Only the statue, and empty inside.
Commander, you are quite harsh.
You tried to revive the call to the army among the Marley people.
For most of the Marley people, the war is just another article in the newspaper.
While they are reading, their country is growing.
That's great.
They are arranged in a way in which the bullets catch demons and people from annexed countries instead of them.
And even if you introduce a law for which the Marley people will hear a whistle over their heads,
they will not stop fighting until the country collapses.
And I would like to convey to the one who controls the Marley and the walls that it is too late to change something.
You are really merciless, Commander.
I am cornered.
As you guessed, this country is ruled by the Tiber family.
The Marley people chose the path of eternal burning of the war for themselves.
Our family gave Marley freedom and strength in the hope of redemption.
As a result, Eldia and Marley got dirty in the dark.
And the Tiber people are responsible for this.
And I decided that at the upcoming festival, the whole world would finally learn the truth.
I really wanted to look at the statue.
After all, Marley needs a hero again.
Teo Magat, are you ready to shake my hand again?
Good morning, Pokka.
Pig, what are you doing?
I'm just used to it.
I scared you.
Stand up and walk normally.
The giants come from the south.
The further to the mountains that are to the north from the wall, the weaker the defense.
So we need to attack the north?
This is one of the options.
However, our large ships have nowhere to moor except the harbor in the south.
With them we will get an advantage.
So from the south?
However, it was in the south that we lost our scouts.
Their forces are concentrated here.
Perhaps the harbor has already been destroyed.
Well, what do you suggest?
I was called to share the collected information.
Okay, enough.
I don't understand at all why we gave the word to the Eldians.
Excellent planning of the operation.
There are so many bright minds among the bosses.
They would rather have their brilliant plan.
Interesting.
Will they trust the four kids again?
I overtook.
Folka overtook Gabi.
I'm so happy about the little things.
And really, happiness in ignorance.
Whatever success Folka has not achieved now, Gabi will not catch up to him.
Have you seen how he got to the end?
Hey, baby, why are you making noise?
For the first time, Folka overtook Gabi.
Oh, come on.
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
Folka overtook Gabi for the first time.
Well, what do you think?
No, it's just a run-up.
This victory will go down in history.
Well, stop it.
I'm already ashamed.
It's really cool.
Now the armored one is definitely yours.
You have nothing to do with me in life.
I brought victory to our homeland in the war.
I understand.
But we have not yet been announced who will inherit the armored one.
And until there are no results, I will give it my all.
Oh, and I didn't know what kind of connoisseur he was.
Your brother is so going to inherit a beastly giant.
And you will become an honored marlin.
Why do you have to try so hard?
For you!
Oh.
I told you after all.
What?
That is, you insert sticks into my wheels for me?
What nonsense are you talking about?
It seems that it did not reach her.
Huh?
What a fool!
What's wrong with him?
Oh, hello.
Our little warriors.
Gabi!
I heard about you, Gabi.
You have done a real feat, Gabi.
Well, actually, I'm Sofia.
Huh?
Aren't you ashamed?
He ate in the middle of the day and came to the girls.
Old fart.
Shut up, Korgastrash.
I can't praise our heroes anymore.
Yes, your praise will only cause trouble for them.
Come on, go to your mommy.
By the way, I have a treat for you.
Eat well and grow like Commander Brown.
Thank you very much.
Wow.
They will really declare war right here in the ghetto?
It looks like a theater scene.
They say the whole elite will gather here.
And after this festival, the whole world will be on our side.
Of course.
And all the problems of the eagle will disappear in a wonderful way.
Do you think nothing will come out?
I don't agree.
Our enemies from the Middle East Alliance will also be here.
We moved here with my family from the foreign ghetto.
It was terrible there.
In other countries, the attitude towards the Saudis is much worse.
Then we definitely can't sit idly by.
The ghetto must have been chosen to let people know us better.
We need to show them that we are not devils at all.
But how?
Smile.
I understand that you are offended by all the white light,
but lower your arrogance.
And you, Sofia, should stop being crooked.
But I am not crooked.
Then what will you do to yourself?
Why?
I am already in the form of perfection.
I am so cute and smart.
I will easily lead the elite around my finger
and finally strengthen my positions.
Devil, you are in the flesh.
If you stand in the way of Falk again, you will regret it.
You are definitely a devil.
It's Commander Magat.
Come in.
Oh, it will require a large-scale dismantling.
Age is strongly affected.
Congratulations, Marshal.
Is the army now yours?
No.
The army belongs to the country,
and the country is under your full control.
That's not quite right.
I'm just the one who's in charge.
And now I know why no one tried to turn him around before.
It's too hard.
I would gladly let it all go,
but now I have no right to do so.
That's the fate I got.
It was my responsibility.
The house is on the verge of destruction,
but the foundation is still strong.
And on this foundation,
traces of rats sneaked into the house are found.
Well done, Falk.
It's all thanks to you, Kruger.
To be honest, I don't really believe I can beat Gabby,
but I'm not going to give up anyway.
All right.
But I have to thank you.
Thank you for sending all my letters.
You helped me out.
Oh, don't mention it.
Did your relatives send it to you?
They said it would be more fun in the hospital,
but I'm afraid I'm a little out of shape.
It's time to move on.
After the festival, I'll be back home.
I see.
The doctor is coming.
All right, I have to go.
See you.
Can I sit next to you?
Yes, of course.
With your permission.
I'm Dr. Yeager, a therapist.
Sometimes I come here to drink tea.
Nice to meet you.
I'm Kruger.
Nice to meet you, Kruger.
It seems you get along well with that boy.
Yes, it's noticeable.
I think I would also find common language with him.
After all, he also comes to this shop in search of a interlocutor.
This boy's uncle was the head of the Eldian restorers.
All the restorers were sent to paradise, and their families were also not going to be spared.
In order to protect their family, the boy became a warrior candidate with his brother.
When his brother earned the right to inherit the animal-like giant,
the Grayson family was able to breathe relief.
Why did you tell me this?
Don't ask him for more credit.
If he goes under suspicion, all Grayson's efforts will go to waste.
If you are really healthy, it is better to return to your family.
If you miss the opportunity, you will regret for the rest of your life that you did not have time to see them.
Regret, you say?
Have you already missed the opportunity?
I regret it every day.
That day my son took my daughter out of the wall.
I wanted him to become a doctor.
I pushed him too hard.
I'm guilty.
It's all because of me.
Mr. Yeager!
Why did you leave again?
I'm sorry. I was distracted for a moment.
Let's go, Mr. Yeager.
Everything will be fine.
The End
How great! I saw them in the newspapers.
It's not time for a trip.
We need to serve them first class.
Look, empty glasses. Let's go!
Falko, wine!
Here!
What is it?
They don't give us plates, do they?
Who has such a nasty smell?
I'm terribly ashamed.
Quiet! Don't make a noise.
Your wonderful deed.
Lady, any problems?
I'm so embarrassed.
I poured my kimono and asked this young man for help.
Thank you.
What a bother.
Please come with me.
Why?
Who knows what they did to you?
Are you okay?
Yes, she saved me.
She knows I'm a Jew.
It's a woman.
I think she's from the East, from Chizor.
Oh, Willy!
Willy!
They saved her.
Ambassador Gwen!
Long time no see.
Nambe, I haven't seen you since I was a child.
Yes, I've always brought you to tears.
Do you remember this, Willy?
You fell from a tree, didn't you?
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for visiting us this evening.
Until recently, we have been constantly struggling with you
in an endless struggle for resources.
However, the enemies of yesterday are the enemies of today.
Oh, sorry, that is, the enemies of yesterday are friends of today.
Let's wash the toilet together with a drunk drink
and raise the glasses in a new toast.
Let's drink to peace in the whole world.
Thank you very much.
You have such elegant jokes, Mr. Ambassador.
Well, I'm afraid our guests didn't understand the game of words, but in general.
So let me continue.
Bye, Willy!
Saviors!
Tomorrow I invite you to visit the Liberio internment zone.
In this place live those who destroyed whole countries.
Those whose blood flows in my veins.
Demons, known to everyone as Eldians.
Marley, who suffered the most from demons,
used them to oppress other countries, and the tragedy repeated.
I understand your desire to destroy the Eldians.
And I declare that there is a solution that will break this vicious circle.
And this solution I will announce at tomorrow's performance in front of the whole world.
To the great dramaturg and witnesses of history!
To the great dramaturg and witnesses of history!
What the...
What's going on?
Gabby!
You finally woke up!
What's going on here?
Festival!
A whole crowd of people came to the ghetto and opened all these stalls!
Try it!
So this is a festival!
Let's go!
It's so bad!
There was nothing to eat.
We would have a festival every day.
That's for sure.
Lately, I've been feeling a little sick.
I'm sorry, but I'm not going to eat.
I'm sorry, but I'm not going to eat.
I'm sorry, but I'm not going to eat.
I'm sorry, but I'm not going to eat.
I'm sorry, but I'm not going to eat.
That's for sure.
Lately, so much new is happening.
That's for sure.
I have a feeling that something is going to change very soon.
Yes, that's for sure.
I'm sorry, but I'm not going to eat.
I'm sorry, but I'm not going to eat.
I'm sorry, but I'm not going to eat.
I'm sorry, but I'm not going to eat.
I'm sorry, but I'm not going to eat.
I'm sorry, but I'm not going to eat.
I'm sorry, but I'm not going to eat.
I'm sorry, but I'm not going to eat.
I'm sorry, but I'm not going to eat.
I'm sorry, but I'm not going to eat.
I'm sorry, but I'm not going to eat.
I'm sorry, but I'm not going to eat.
I'm sorry, but I'm not going to eat.
No matter what you're sad about,
despite the fact that you disappear,
you still have to live.
Oh.
You've had a lot of fun!
Guys, where's Falko?
He said he saw an acquaintance and ran away.
What?
Will he make it in time?
Ah!
Relax, you're at least once in your life.
Such a crowd.
Look, he's back.
Mr. Brown!
Where the hell are you?
Can I talk to you for a moment?
Right now?
It's okay.
There's still time before the start.
Come here!
What's going on?
You'll see soon.
Come here!
Okay.
There he is!
Hi.
Long time no see, Rainer.
Eron
In the dark basement, Rainer meets Eron.
While the crowd is listening to Will's speech,
Eron declares,
we are the same.
Next, the announcement of war.
