It didn't work out, did it?
Why is it always like this?
Because people are never deprived of the pull to violence.
Right, Captain?
Betrayer!
Why?
Aren't we friends?
Yes, we're friends!
Yes, we're friends!
But...
I...
What did you just say?

Even if we stop Eren in the fastest possible way,
Liberia will not be able to save us.
How come?
And if we lift the flying boat into the air, we don't know where Eren is.
Searches will take even more time.
And in general, it is impossible to stay here for half a day.
That's it.
I have an idea.
The port is located south of here, in the coastal Marley city of Odih.
There is our own hangar in Duma.
We can prepare a flying boat in it.
We can go right now on a ship with a boat on the buksir.
And we serve them.
We are already in Odih.
The coastal city,
judging by the distance,
it is comparable to the land and the gulf of the land.
Odih is far enough for us to get there before the gulf of the land.
But will it last half a day?
We'll have to take a risk.
Take a risk?
In any case, don't lift the boat into the air.
Do you have coal on the ship?
Yes.
It will take 30 minutes to sail away.
You have 15 minutes.
If you die here,
the end will come not only to Hitsuruna, but to the whole world.
Don't forget.
Yes.
I'll call the captain and the others.
I'll explain everything to Mikasa.
Let's go!
THE END

Mammoth's mechanics!
Kill them!
Ah, you damn traitors!
Why did they get out of the dungeon?
Where are they running, risking their lives?
Really?
Rainer!
Get him!
Run, run!
Run!
The titan is waiting!
Shoot Mammoth's men!
Get up!
The ship is already nearby!
Get out of the way!
It's bad.
Do they really want to take the flying boat on the mainland?
Take all the thunder spears you have!
They want to sail on the ship to kill Eren!
Destroy the ship at any cost!
If they kill Eren,
the Paradis will drown in blood!
The whole world will have to take revenge
and kill your parents,
brothers, sisters and brothers!
Give up your hearts!
Oh no!
They started shooting at the ship!
The two titans won't hold out until they sail!
I have to go to battle too!
Use the power of the safe titan!
We can't.
The first transformation to the titan will not go well.
But we have to do something!
Lean on me.
I'll take you to the ship,
and then I'll go to battle.
It's not me here, Goliath.
We wouldn't stand here and wouldn't think about it.
Valka!
Valka, stop!
No!
I'll take you to the ship first.
Get in!
Cut the top off!
The horses!
They shot at him in the chest.
And in the mouth.
He'll get better soon.
And you...
I'm protecting the ship!
Valka!
Commander Magat!
Valka is in there!
Damn it! The reinforcements!
We have to stop him!
Or we won't even be able to get out of here!
The reinforcements!
How?
What are you doing here, Valka?
Run to the ship!
Okay!
I can't even...
move.
Nothing...
I don't see anything.
Let's go!
Let's finish them off!
Horses!
Die!
Traitor!
Valka!
Die!
Die!
Traitor!
Horses!
Are you shaking?
The earth...
won't stop shaking!
Valka!
I know it!
We're shooting at the traitors with pistols!
Let's get rid of the transporter!
Let's attack together!
Damn it!
We're going to die!
For our island!
For our country!
Valka!
Valka!
Come on!
Their ship is destroyed!
There's no other chance!
There won't be!
Damn it!
Valka!
I'm putting everything on one charge!
We need to break...
the hole in the bottom!
I will be...
the savior of the Maldives!
Valka!
Father, help me!
Valka!
We're ready to sail!
Hurry up!
Let's go!
Until the traitors come back!
Valka!
There are no more enemies!
Get out!
Run!
Hold on, Valka!
Valka!
It's all good now.
Valka,
you did well.
Take him.
All right,
sail now.
And you,
cover your back.
The commander took out Valka.
Yes, the moment was dangerous.
But...
Where's the commander?
The Marshal is already...
The enemy!
There's still someone left!
So, the explosion of the train
with the support of the Egerists
was your doing?
Exactly.
And why did you
take it to the ship?
There,
the cruiser of the Maldives
was captured.
It's fast.
You can easily
catch up with my companions
and drown him.
You can't leave
such a threat.
Then let's go together.
They're already running.
Well, let it be.
I'll set fire to the storage of supplies.
This is your last chance
to jump into the sea.
No, thank you.
I was just looking for an opportunity
to die.
Why did you help us?
It can destroy
your island.
From the citadel of Shiganshina,
I saw
how my students jumped
to the south, together with
Annie Leonhardt.
I figured out their purpose
and was touched in the chest
by the way
they grew up.
If you hadn't stopped
the reinforcements,
we would have come to an end.
And you would have become
one of the heroes who saved the world.
So,
the two of us are a pair.
I have no reason
to be proud of myself.
I didn't listen
to my conscience
when I was a child.
I saved soldiers
for the state.
I ordered them to disarm the walls.
Finally, I realized
that if they could
just lead a normal life,
I would be happy.
You can't do it yourself,
but I
respect you.
Open up, hey!
Open up! Who are you talking to?
What are you doing there?
Surely, and the children too.
Thank you.
By the way,
what's your name?
Kit Shadis.
And yours?
Teomagat.
THE END

THE END
The course to Odigo
was chosen by me and Magat.
More precisely,
it was the only option
to save
Liberia,
your homeland.
That's all.
Then
I have
no reason to fight anymore.
I
will leave.
Even if the God of the Earth
could stop
Liberia's destruction
from Marley,
it would still not be avoided.
And Magat understood it.
But he gave his life
to open the way for us.
And that was
not for the sake of Liberia or Marley,
but to let us save
at least one person
and more.
He doesn't even know his name.
Then
let me repeat the question.
Will you be able
to kill Teren?
If I
try to kill him,
then you
will be able to watch
silently.
I don't want to
fight anymore.
And with you
I don't want to fight.
Not with any of you.
Not with you.
Not even with Teren.
What they saw that day,
what they talked about that day,
what they chose that day,
it was all
his wish.
Next.
The dawn of humanity.
