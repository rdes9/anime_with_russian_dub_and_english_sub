Look at this!
What is it?
I see! Get ready for the jump!
Anyangapong, you too, go! Quickly!
It's too early! First, we will reach the progenitor.
And after that, I'll sit wherever I want.
And after that, I'll sit wherever I want.
So land on the progenitor, do you understand?
Anyangapong!
And this one is here.
Damn animal-like!
So I'll have to look for him.
The first target is the animal-like.
All forces to destroy him.
Let's stop him, Gu.
Gu!
Jump!
Aaron!
Aaron!
Damn it! I can't land!
Reinhardt!
A programmed titan?
Are you even a titan-transporter?
And those people from the U.P.F.?
Reinhardt!
Aaron, when I get you out of there,
I'll ask you one last question.
How exactly are you free?
The titan-transporter?
The titan-transporter?
The titan-transporter?
Attack on the Titans, the final season.
Chapter 3. Battle of the Sky and the Earth.
It's clear why he fought like that. It's just a shell.
Does it mean that Zeke is hiding from us in the same way as the Titan is?
Does it mean that we have to find his real body in this huge pile of bones?
But it's just impossible! We need to find him!
We need to find him!
We need to find him!
I know!
I'll blow everything up in a minute!
And you, with the help of the transporter, go away!
Armin...
Eren is waiting for my attack.
Therefore, he will not let himself be killed.
But...
If I can blow up the bones,
I will be able to destroy the Titan!
I will be able to destroy the Titan!
I will be able to destroy the Titan!
If I can blow up the bones,
we will be able to find out where Eren and Zeke are!
Be careful, Armin!
If there are any problems,
forget about us and hit hard!
The one who is unable to sacrifice anything
will not be able to change anything.
I know it.
There is nothing to change
without sacrifice.
I have to give up my hopes
and kill
Eren.
Armin!
Armin!
Eren!
And one, two, three!
He doesn't move.
But he's breathing.
It seems he hit his head.
Do you think he also came from Paradise Island?
Hey, do you hear me?
You know I'm not Leonhart.
This is my daughter.
Hey, you!
Do you hear me?
They're coming! Reiner!
Who are they?
They don't look like fools.
That's for sure.
What should we do?
We don't have enough thunderbolts.
And do you think Armin is alive?
He would have turned into a Titan
from the slightest scratch.
So, he was caught unharmed.
He was caught unharmed.
He was caught unharmed.
He was caught unharmed.
But he was dragged
to the side of Eren's tail.
And the way there blocks
many Titans.
Even in the best shape,
I wouldn't break through there.
So, don't rush.
Mikasa, calm down.
I'll distract the enemies
and take them away.
Don't worry, Captain.
I understand who they are.
They are the predecessors
of the nine Titans.
We don't know if they managed
to keep their minds.
But I'm sure that the power
of the Progenitor will be able
to bring them back to life
over and over again.
This is an innumerable army of Titans
created for battle.
And we can't handle them.
Yes.
That's why we can't take them
seriously.
We've never been friends with Eren.
What?
You're not a Titan.
What is she doing?
First of all,
we have to fight here.
I have only one goal.
Stop!
Disappear, monster!
Pic!
Goliath?
I'm here, Reiner!
Keep him in place!
Captain!
Hurry up.
We have to bring the army back.
He's our only hope.
Otherwise,
we'll all die just like that.
The Paradis forces are fighting
the titans.
But the course and the speed are the same.
He's coming here.
You can't sit and do nothing.
We'll meet the enemy
with fire.
Yes, sir!
But, sir, most of the soldiers
were sent on patrol.
In our best case,
we have only three cannons.
Can we sit in the country
and do nothing?
Now that these brave people
are desperately fighting
on the enemy's back,
what do you think
they're fighting for?
Go, Reiner!
Hurry up!
Lykasa!
I've calculated.
I'm turning it off.
You want to
just strangle me?
Eren!
Is this the end?
No.
It's not him.
It's Ymir.
If Eren
just wants to move
forward as he said,
then it's resistance
by will and by the world.
And that means
that Ymir
wants to destroy
all of humanity.
The progeny
and the world are invincible.
I won't be able to do anything.
That means
everything
will end
like this.
No!
We have died!
Reiner!
Reiner!
Reiner!
Are you
kidding me?
Hush!
Get up,
Coney!
Captain!
I'm sorry.
I think my UPM
is damaged.
Mine too.
The right handle is broken.
I can't lift it.
Jean!
Let me go!
Jean, let me go!
I can turn again!
So what?
With armor, you can turn
into a
You think
we can still win?
No.
Let's fight
to the very end.
We are the intelligence corps.
The scouts can't give up.
Jean!
Coney!
Captain!
Captain!
Come on!
I'm strong!
So
even if you all attack at once
Mikasa, don't stand in the way!
What?
Captain!
Listen,
I would never have thought
when it
took off,
how could I not come?
And I
am glad that I came.
Bird!
And people on it!
And why are you
here, Gabi?
Because you left us, Reiner!
I can fight too!
No!
The Azumabit's ship
sank.
It couldn't stand
the transformation of the Titan.
We didn't know
if it could take off,
but Coney let us try.
We have to pay back
for the trust
and stop Ghoul at any cost!
Gabi!
And where is Armin?
I mean, Pig?
Armin was caught, and his life is in danger.
The Titan
must have dragged him
towards the tail.
Annie, we need your help.
Your childhood friends
are always captured.
We will bring him back, be sure.
And what about Pig?
She is near the head.
She tried to blow up the heads,
but Titan Malotoboritz stopped her.
Blow up?
Let's start at the same time.
Captain!
One group will save Armin.
We need an explosion of the colossal Titan.
The other group
will try to blow up the heads
and kill Aaron.
Two groups will hit at the same time.
We can't
worry about Aaron anymore.
No.
We could never do that.
Captain!
But...
No, but...
We can't fly.
We would be dead without him.
Yes.
And we couldn't do anything.
Jean...
I would like to say
so much to this idiot.
Damn it!
I don't want to kill Aaron either.
But the captain
can't fight because of me.
And the Titan is a progenitor
against us.
How can we win if we be careful?
Mikasa!
Aaron!
Aaron!
We need to kill him!
Mikasa!
Mikasa!
Mikasa!
Concentrate on
how to get Armin out.
Don't think
about anything else.
Yes.
They are coming back
to the attacking Titan.
We have to help them.
We only have two cannons.
It's something.
Are they refugees?
Wait, maybe not.
They have traces
from the bandages on their left arms.
Are you the Eldians?
Hey!
Wait!
We came to ask for help for the wounded.
We don't have time for that now.
What do you want from us?
You see, Leonhart,
I told you, you can't get help from the Marleyians.
We surpass them in numbers.
And we have more experience in battle.
The Marleyians always
sent us in the first rows to kill.
Eldians, drop your weapons!
Stop!
You were told to drop your weapons.
You're here?
When did you get here?
Minister MÃ¼ller.
What is it?
They are still fighting each other.
Falco, watch out for the shots.
It's started!
Jean, Reiner!
Don't let them kill you!
And you, don't die either.
I will distract
Titan Malataborz.
Rick,
come up with a way to free yourself.
Jean,
run!
Come on, Jean!
Just hold on, Reiner.
Until I get to the detonator.
Of course.
There are more Titans now.
I would like to
fly in the air.
Damn it!
Rick, Rick!
Run!
Jean,
if you think that I don't
deserve anything and I can't fight,
then you are wrong.
Thanks to the endurance of the transporter,
while I'm still alive,
I will fight.
I will turn a hundred times.
Therefore, Jean,
don't worry.
Get to the detonator.
What
will give a hundred victories
if there are a million
enemies in front of you?
He made Mariana
out of Bertold.
I won't forgive him.
Here he is.
This one.
Who?
That one, that's the weird one.
It's there.
Where?
And how about this one of nine Titans?
Or a warrior,
or an animal-like one,
with teeth.
What to do with it?
Mikasa,
you can describe it normally!
I've described.
See?
This Titan just jumped.
I can support you with the fire from the rifle so you don't even scratch the titan where is the zig where is he even if I find him I can't fight the curse I never failed
not once but why with his last order there are so many problems
maybe at that moment we completed our task to the end what if our task was to take these guys to the ocean
tell me did you really give up your hearts so that the hearts of others were trampled to dust
for nothing the world without titans about which we dreamed should have been perfect it should have been
perfect no other was worth the hearts given to you
first sorry but I do not regret that I did not choose you on that day
I entrusted our future to the one whose eyes are burning the same fire
and
and then
no it will grow to the top
Enough! Run, Kakariko!
Eni!
We need to stick together.
One by one, they're going to kill us.
Akabe is running towards Bertold.
Bad.
Behind!
Move.
You're my body, why don't you move?
I beg you, move!
All of us are going to die!
Reiner...
Pig...
Jean...
Koni...
Mikasa...
Eni...
They're all going to die there!
Get up, coward!
Get up, coward!
You're useless!
I hate you so much!
Even now, you're still betraying me!
We've been given a second life, responsibility, hope, and it's all in vain.
You didn't pay them anything for it!
Why are you lying here dead?
Move!
Get your ass up!
What are you doing here?
I'm going to kill you!
What are you doing here?
I'm going to kill you!
What are you doing here?
I'm going to kill you!
What are you doing here?
I'm going to kill you!
What are you doing here?
I'm going to kill you!
What are you doing here?
I'm going to kill you!
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
No!
Impostor and Lord...
What if I was dead?
How could I have thought then?
Because my brain would not have enough oxygen.
This is not a dream. This is not a hallucination.
This is not a funeral dream.
This is the way.
This is...
...the real one.
I was supposed to die in the Titan's past.
How could I have known how they were there?
Because the Eldians are connected with each other by way?
If so...
...then I must be able to do something here.
Exactly.
Think!
Think!
Hello...
...Zig.
And you, hello...
...Karen's friend.
Did Emhyr swallow you too?
Chapter four.
A long dream.
In the past...
...in the universe...
...there was only lifeless matter.
Endless things appeared and disappeared...
...that didn't interest anyone.
But one day...
...something could survive.
We called it life.
As a result, the reason why life...
...could survive...
...was its ability to multiply.
In order to multiply, life had to die.
Life had to change its form...
...and adapt to the environment.
And it became a part of us.
It began to grow, spread...
...and flourish.
That is...
...the purpose of any life is to multiply.
This sand...
...stones...
...water...
...don't try to multiply.
They don't try to multiply.
Death and death...
...are the opposite of its main purpose...
...multiplication.
And we are doomed to be afraid...
...of our end.
Like many...
...it desperately wanted to escape...
...this fear.
It created a strong, big...
...strong...
...and immortal body.
And then...
...it fled to the world...
...where death had never existed.
This is the world of its forefathers...
...and the world where death never existed.
If that's the case...
...I don't understand.
What is the purpose of the world?
I thought about it.
I spent a lot of time...
...trying to understand it.
Since it has such a great power...
...why couldn't it understand it?
Why couldn't it go against King Fritz?
And why is it here...
...for two thousand years...
...continuing to follow his orders?
There is something left...
...that it is still tied to.
Eren could understand it...
...but I couldn't.
That's why the world was supported by Eren.
I have to ask...
...how to get back to the usual world?
Who knows?
I don't think it's possible.
No.
I will never give up.
Why?
Because...
To continue to multiply.
Is it really important for you...
...to continue the existence of your species?
What is happening now...
...can be called a tragedy of life...
...that is controlled by fear.
Fear that was created...
...by the attempts of life itself...
...to survive.
But my comrades are fighting there.
It's not too late...
...to save many people...
...from the meeting with fear.
They are fighting with it.
Why is it bad to lose?
To be alive means...
...to die sooner or later.
Maybe...
...the moment before death...
...will bring relief.
After all, the race to multiply...
...will end...
...the meaning that slips away from our understanding.
Maybe there will be liberation.
The sun has already set.
Eran and I and Mikasa...
...run to the tree on the hill.
Eran suggested it...
...and immediately fell off the place.
And Mikasa left him on purpose.
Of course, I was the last one.
That day...
...there was a light, warm breeze...
...and it was so good for me...
...to just run away...
...from it.
And then...
...a thought came to my mind.
Maybe I was born...
...only to...
...run to the hill with them.
And then...
...when I was reading at home...
...on a rainy day...
...and when I was feeding the squirrel...
...in the forest with crickets...
...and when we were walking...
...through the market together...
...everything happened again.
I felt that...
...these ordinary moments...
...were incredibly beautiful.
Where did it come from?
I found it here...
...in the sand.
Where did it come from?
I don't know.
And even if this thing is not needed...
...for reproduction...
...and in general completely useless...
...for me...
...it is a great value.
Ah!
Exactly.
We threw the ball...
...caught it...
...and threw it again.
Again and again.
There was no purpose in it.
But as you said...
...I would be happy...
...just to play the ball...
...till the end of time.
The End
Annie!
What is it?
Oh my God!
Marcel!
Emile!
Did Bertolt...
...save us?
I don't understand...
...but...
...you can't miss such a chance!
I got it!
Give us...
...Armin!
Armin!
Annie!
Annie?
Armin!
Forgive me.
Now...
...I'm fine.
Annie, behind you!
What's going on there?
Are they defending the Titan?
Looks like it.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
I'm here!
Impossible!
Did you miss me...
...Levi?
I'm here!
I'm here!
I'm here!
I'm here!
How could you Miss...
...Levi?
I missed you so much!
Zik...
What is going on here?
Zik made all this!
Zik?
He woke our comrades up...
...on a path without life or death.
All the Eldians in the world are united by the way.
Most likely because this is the will of the Transfigurer and the world.
Because she is waiting for something from us.
Bertolt.
Mr. Xavier, our wish has not been fulfilled.
I still believe that the plan in Tonaz was right.
But if I can play the ball with you again, I would like to be born again.
For this, I must thank you, father.
I took from you everything most valuable.
Your life, strength and even your memories.
And that's why I know that you don't want to stand aside.
Friends, lend us a hand.
Give me your hand.
What a beautiful weather.
If only I could understand it earlier.
Well, when I killed so many people, it would be too much to ask for this.
THE END
Did Gul really stop?
THE END
Come on, Jean!
Jean!
Damn it!
What a pity!
Suicide!
Suicide!
This thing is getting close to Eren's head.
Reiner!
Jean, run!
Let's get out of here!
Armin will destroy everything here!
Wait! Reiner is here!
An armored titan can withstand a colossal explosion.
In addition, to miss this chance means not to respect Reiner's determination.
Thank you.
We couldn't have stopped Gul without the help of all of you.
Farewell.
Eren.
THE END
Karina, are you okay?
What happened?
Such a powerful explosion?
They're all intact.
Look.
Look, Kostya.
So, Eren is dead?
After waking up, the Ackermans can start experiencing severe headaches.
I can't stand people who...
So that was our last conversation.
Mikasa, I've always hated you.
It can't be!
Ah!
I can't say I don't regret it.
But we did the right thing.
We were able to stop Gul.
How did you manage to get out of the ghetto?
This is Mr. Leonhardt. He brought us all here.
Go to him.
Armin!
Do you see Reiner?
He's alive!
Reiner!
Hey, look down there!
Is it still alive after such an explosion?
What is it?
I don't know.
But I know that you can't leave it alive.
Yes, of course.
I didn't think the explosion would kill that creature.
Yes, but what can we do?
It's bad. If that thing and Eren meet, Gul can start again.
Yes, we have to kill her.
How are we going to kill what survived such an explosion?
Our goal is Eren.
You've already understood.
The nightmare won't end until we kill him.
Dad, I need to finish one thing.
I can handle it.
Really, for Colt's sake.
Why? Why did it come to this?
Did you get hurt in the leg?
No, I've been like this for a long time.
Thank you.
Can you go?
Be careful.
Bring the wounded here.
If you hadn't shot into the air then, our enmity wouldn't have ended.
I've made enough mistakes.
Let's work together.
Dad!
Annie!
The steam is coming from the glowing thing.
Dead?
No, it doesn't smell like dead titans.
And what about Eren?
I don't know.
No, it doesn't smell like dead titans.
And what if the same steam was used in the village of Ragaku?
What?
Mikasa, Pic, sit on the falcon and get out of here.
What are you talking about?
The Ackermans. You are the owners of the titans and it doesn't work.
You know what we have to do now.
It's too much. I can't.
Now!
No! Dad! Dad!
Dad!
So our end has come.
It seems so.
We'll leave the rest to our comrades.
This is how the intelligence corps meets their death.
Do you remember the night we burned the corpses?
Yes.
By the way, it's your fault.
We had to save humanity because of you.
It's impossible. How could this happen?
Hey! Hey! Annie!
Are you all right? What's going on?
C-commander!
What's going on?
What's going on?
What's going on?
What's going on?
C-commander!
C-commander!
C-commander!
C-commander!
C-commander!
Damn it!
I've gathered an army.
Enough!
I won't let you pass!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
You like water, don't you, Aaron?
All right.
Let it be your way.
Let's go to the end!
Gabby!
Jean!
Gabby!
How could this happen?
Mom!
Mom!
Vic!
Annie!
When will our suffering end?
Nekasa!
Get a grip!
We're the only ones who can kill Aaron now!
It hurts so much!
I can't take it anymore!
I want to go back!
I want to go back to our home!
Nekasa, wake up.
You'll catch a cold.
Aaron?
What?
Did I fall asleep?
How long did I sleep?
You must be tired.
I think I had a very long sleep.
You just need to rest and do nothing.
I caught a huge fish, which means...
Nekasa, why are you crying?
I don't know.
For a second it seemed that I had no place here.
We can't change anything anymore.
What?
That day you and I left everything and ran away.
Here.
Marley, two months after the war ended,
and the invasion of Paradis came closer.
They would have killed all of us.
Armin is clearly looking for us with all his might.
I couldn't help but tell the story and continue the cycle of deaths.
I couldn't help but destroy humanity beyond the borders of the island.
So let's live my last four years in silence.
Just the two of us.
And no one else.
It was you who suggested it, Nekasa.
It was your idea.
Yes.
I'm sorry.
We agreed not to think about it anymore.
Can you give me one promise?
When I die, throw this scarf away.
After all, a long life awaits you ahead.
Forget about me.
And be free.
Please, Nekasa.
Forget about me.
I'm sorry.
I couldn't.
Iron in the titan's mouth.
Friends, help me!
Got it, Nekasa!
Run!
Run!
THE END
See you...
...Eren.
The final chapter.
To the tree on the hill.
I understand that this is necessary for the future,
which the power of the attacking titan has shown you.
But you really had to beat me so hard.
Was it necessary to hit my stomach with my knee?
I tried to push you two away from me.
I was wondering why I was doing it.
I think I got too carried away.
I'm very sorry.
Don't apologize to me.
Apologize to Nekasa.
She was hit hard by your stupidity.
Yes, you're right.
So you wanted to push us away from you
and turn us into heroes
who killed you and saved humanity from destruction?
Exactly.
Every person who survived will be indebted to you.
The demons who rose against the island
and remained loyal to the people.
It will make you the most famous people in the world.
So we have to protect the paradise from the whole world
just like the Tiber did after the Great Titan War?
We will never become heroes, Eren.
I'm sorry to disappoint you,
but neither I nor everyone else
wants to play heroes.
Where are you going?
To the place we wanted to get.
I'll tell you about the way
and the world.
So these are the fire rivers?
They really flow like real rivers.
Why did I stop there?
What?
You said that the power of the Titans exists
because the world has been subordinate to the King Fritz
for 2,000 years.
Exactly.
And you said that the power of the Titans
has been subordinate to the King Fritz
for 2,000 years.
Exactly.
He burned down her house, killed her family
and tore her tongue out.
But even when she gained incredible strength,
she served him.
Why did you make her do that?
When I touched her on the way,
I felt something.
I couldn't believe it.
The mother of the world
loved King Fritz.
What?
That's what's holding her in her arms
for 2,000 years.
I can't understand the depths of the soul
about the mother of the world.
But it's obvious that she suffered
for 2,000 years.
She was looking for the one who would free her.
And this man came.
It was Mikasa.
What?
You said Mikasa?
Exactly.
Didn't you listen to me?
I listened to you.
Why Mikasa?
Well, only the world knows that.
I don't understand what Mikasa did.
I only see the result
of Mikasa's actions.
I was moving forward
to achieve this result.
I destroyed humanity.
I made the Eldians kill each other.
And I sent my friends to the battle
not knowing if they would survive
or die in it.
This is the future you saw
at the award ceremony.
Armin.
There is a mess in my head.
Because of my parents,
I have no past or future.
Everything is at the same time.
That's why I had no choice.
That day, that moment,
Bertolt was supposed to survive.
What?
And I sent him to his mother,
not to her.
Let's go, Eren.
Okay.
So, how did it go?
What?
The conversation with Mikasa.
Do you think she can forget you
and live happily with someone else?
Live the way you wanted?
Well, I don't know.
Do you think this is the answer?
I can't forgive you.
What can you say
that you ignored her feelings for a long time?
Mikasa was always ready to give everything for you,
even life.
Do you think you can say
forget about me and that's enough?
At least Mikasa should forget about you
and find her happiness with someone else.
You know, she will find a good guy for herself
faster than you think.
No.
I can't stand it.
I don't want her to find someone.
I want to be the only one for her.
And when I die,
I want her to suffer for me for ten years.
Oh, I see.
I didn't think you'd say
something so pathetic.
Just don't tell Mikasa about it.
I want her to be happy.
I really do.
But I...
Damn it!
I don't want to die.
I don't want to leave Mikasa.
I don't want to leave all of you.
Eren, then let's keep searching.
Let's find another way.
He's not here.
I'm sure none of them wanted to die.
But still...
I...
80%.
What?
I trampled 80% of humanity.
How could you?
Eren, why?
I tried to completely destroy
all of humanity behind the walls,
but you stopped me.
But 80% died.
The world behind the walls
went down to the same level of development
as Paradis.
What does it mean?
There will be no more one-sided war
for destruction.
But this conflict will not end.
What do you mean?
Do you want to say
that these actions are pointless?
Stop it!
The war hasn't started yet!
I can't.
You can save only 20% of humanity.
It's decided.
Decided?
You decided it!
You killed them!
How many...
I've watched it many times,
but the outcome is the same.
Everything is happening
in the memories of the future.
Armin,
you're right.
I'm a slave of freedom.
This is some kind of madness!
It means
nothing can be changed!
It can't be!
It's not a solution at all!
It means there will be no war
if there are no people!
It's a bad joke!
It can't be!
Eren,
the end of this conflict
is really not visible.
I'm sure the hell we've been through
has happened again and again.
But we must believe
that one day
we will learn
to understand each other.
And now
everyone will lose faith
even in something so small.
They will remember only one thing.
Kill or you will be killed.
And nothing more.
And you're still saying
that you did it all for us.
That's what they call you.
No.
I don't want to.
Eren,
you're free.
I'm not alone.
I wanted
to destroy everything in the world.
I wanted to see the result.
Why?
I don't know why.
I just
really wanted to do it.
I thought that
I was doing it
to protect you all.
But
Sasha and Hange died
because of me.
And because of me you fought
in a deadly battle with Flock.
Why?
Why did it all come to this?
I finally understood.
Because I'm an idiot.
A complete idiot
who got
a huge power in his hands.
That's why
there can't be
any other outcome.
That's the whole thing.
I understand.
The desire to erase
all humanity from the face of the Earth
is familiar to me.
Stop lying.
You would never...
No one would have thought.
After all, I am a hero
who saved part of humanity.
But it was me who showed you
that book about the world behind the walls
and the idea of a free world
in which no walls gave you.
Me too.
What is it?
You finally noticed.
You were always at our feet.
But you always looked
only into the distance.
Thank you, Aaron.
You showed me
the world behind the walls.
You showed me this sight.
We did it together.
So
we will be together forever.
Right?
After that?
And where?
If it exists,
we will be together forever.
We will suffer for the sin of killing
most of humanity.
Together.
Armin,
it's time.
I will erase your memory of this meeting.
But when it's over,
you will remember it again.
I know.
But after that,
we will meet again.
Yes.
I will be waiting for you
in hell.
Right.
Together.
Forever.
The wounds are getting worse.
What?
Annie?
Yes.
Time is running out.
Now I remember.
I am
Armin.
Your memories
are back, aren't they?
How Aaron came to talk to us.
Yes.
He said
that as a result
of what you decided to do,
the power of the Titans
will disappear from this world
forever.
I remembered everything.
You are an honest bastard.
Aaron,
I can't believe it.
Aaron said
that my mother
will be able to become
a human again.
He said
that we will live
a long life.
But he himself
would be worried about himself.
Damned mortal.
Wow.
I didn't manage
to talk to him.
Welcome back home.
Eglma.
Dad.
Gaby!
Look
who came.
Did you see everything?
It seems
that this is the outcome
for which
you gave your hearts.
Gaby!
Sasha!
Mom! Dad!
Gaby!
Gaby, my girl!
Gaby!
Dad!
Mom,
it seems
that I am
not an armored Titan anymore.
Is it true?
How glad I am
for this.
What?
Forgive me
for everything, Reiner.
For everything
that I needed in this world.
I will go.
What?
Where?
If I stay here,
Aaron
will touch me.
Right.
Let him rest
in a quiet,
calm place.
Do you remember
where Aaron
liked to lie down and sleep?
Yes.
I think it's a great place.
Yes,
I'm from outside.
What is true
is for me and you.
Listen,
Minister Mueller.
Aaron JÃ¤ger is dead.
The Titan force
died with him.
Now we are just
ordinary people.
You can prove
it here and now.
It's just blood.
Maybe...
I said here and now.
Please.
Prove it to us.
Are you people
or Titans?
If we still
had the Titan forces,
we would use them to fight.
But even
with the guns of your guns
we would remain helpless.
The best proof
that we are people doesn't exist.
Who are you?
Eldit from Paradis Island.
Armin Arlert.
I'm the one
who killed Aaron JÃ¤ger
who attacked the Titan.
It was you.
It was you
who looked into my head all the time.
I think your love
was an endless nightmare.
You can't return
the life you took.
But still
I live thanks to
the one you created.
Rest in peace
and peace.
To be continued...
The battle of the sky and the Earth
has been going on for three years.
The countless
people have lost their lives.
And those who managed
to survive
are suffering from unhealing wounds.
As the world was afraid
of its tears,
Eldia gathered an army
consisting of JÃ¤gerists
who gain strength
and strength.
Because of the fear
of the people who survived
across the ocean,
the whole island drowned in a single cry.
We will win. We will survive.
We will lose. We will die.
To win, we must fight.
Fight.
Fight.
Even when the Titan disappeared,
the conflict didn't disappear.
Aaron described to me
the future he knew about.
And even if I can't see
what future awaits us now,
what he described
I saw clearly.
I'm sure
that this is the result of the decisions
of not only Aaron.
The world came to this
as a result of all its decisions,
each of us.
We must fight for our future
so that we don't have to fight anymore.
Even if our lives
are far from peace and peace.
Even if it turns out
to be not the life
that he wanted for us,
whether he wanted it or not,
this is the kind of life
he entrusted to us.
How will we live
in this world
where there are no Titans?
Oh, history has such a beautiful handwriting,
but I can't look at it.
And it smells delicious.
I repeat once again,
stop looking at married women.
It's terrible.
And you yourself are endlessly
carrying your own hair.
For whom is this?
Who do you want to impress?
Girls who will see me
in history textbooks.
You don't confuse the encyclopedia of horses.
It's a pity that now
you will live longer, Rainer.
Paradise Island on the horizon.
Armin, are you sure
that this will work?
We destroyed the walls,
betrayed the island,
and killed Aaron,
whom the Eldians simply worship.
Which of us saved the Alliance
for peaceful negotiations?
I wouldn't be surprised
if our ship drowns on the way.
Yes,
it's amazing that we're still on the move.
This idiot
made us play the role of
heroes.
To make him live longer.
Well, Enya,
did you ever count on a ship
to come back alive?
Of course not, but you yourself
don't look like a suicide.
Right?
We're just going to hell again.
That's the answer.
The intelligence corps
is a bunch of dreamers
who can't back down.
I'm from the military police.
But they won't kill us yet.
The residents of Paradise
will want to hear what we tell them.
They will want to know
our story.
Why do those who
try to destroy each other
in battle
call for death?
Let's tell them
what they saw with their own eyes.
Let's tell them
everything that happened.
Eren,
the rest will come to you soon.
Eren Yeager.
I'm here.
I'm here.
I'm here.
I'm here.
I'm here.
I'm here.
I'm here.
I'm here.
I'm here.
I'm here.
I'm here.
Eren,
the rest will come to you soon.
Eren Yeager.
Aren't you happy?
I want to
see you again.
