        <pre>Captain Levy? I don't know what happened here, but we're lucky.
Our main threat is in the blood.
Let's check Levy's head.
He's dead. It looks like he was hit by a thunderbolt in his lungs.
You can't say for sure, but there's a real mess inside. He died instantly.
Captain Levy, I'm sorry.
Let me see him. I can check his pulse. Let me see him.
Flak!
Is the Titan disappearing? Is he dead?
No. He usually gets sucked in when he disappears.
Is the Titan disappearing? Is he dead?
Has he disappeared?
No. He usually gets sucked in when he disappears.
They ran away!
Damn it!
Calm down!
Don't let them get away!
Zyk!
What happened?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
It was made from clay but my body...
I didn't know where I am...
I just watched.
And assumed that after several years of all this time,
all of it would be gone just in a moment.
Oh my...
assembly!
It was probably fate.
Zyk...
The 30 scouts that you wereÊÑè what
The people who were protecting you were subordinate to you after the titans were turned into the titans.
Where are they now?
Well, it will take a long time to explain, but there are no more of them.
There is no one left who could interfere with us.
Let's go.
You and I will just go forward.
Right, Eren?
Let's go.
What are you doing?

I can't leave...
It's not easy.
Hic! You're not a traitor!
Gabi, did you really think I'd sell my friends?
But you said we have no future, even if we serve Marley!
Look.
I don't believe in Marley.
But I believe in my comrades who I fought with shoulder to shoulder.
There's a smoke signal.
Hic and Goliath pulled him out of the cover.
It's the Titan's progenitor.
Let's take revenge for Liberio!
It's time to finish him off.
Push!
Hic! Hic! Hic!
Borka!
It hurts!
Hic! Hic! Hic!
Hic! Hic! Hic!
I didn't think Marley would go into a desperate attack.
They have too little information to decide on such a late step.
Eren!
Do you hear me?
Please leave the Titan's body!
We'll hide you in the building and you'll go underground with the help of the young fighter!
The enemy has an advantage in this battle!
Hic! Hic! Hic!
Eren!
Hic! Hic! Hic!
Come on, Reiner.
Is that you?
You've done such a stupid thing with the Marley's army.
All soldiers, to arms!
Come on!
Protect Eren!
Eren...
Why?
Eren!
Reiner!
Hic!
Hic!
Come here!
Gabi!
Commander Magatru?
Brown Bestoloch!
Have you been ordered to climb into the enemy's flesh?
I'm sorry!
What is your will?
Gabi!
Colt!
Where's Falco?
Where is he?
He's still inside that fortress.
Falco got hit in the mouth by a spinal fluid and is locked up.
What do you mean?
In addition to Falco, three hundred enemy soldiers drank out of the fluid.
They're all together.
Except for them, the enemy has about five hundred soldiers here.
But they're somewhere else.
We came here out of fear of Reiner.
What are the chances that the enemy will use the power of the progenitor?
I don't know.
But there is no doubt that this is the power of the enemy's main trump card.
Since they haven't played it out yet,
I suppose that they're not yet able to use the power of the progenitor.
Do we need any conditions for that?
But thanks to that, we have the titan of the progenitor and the titan of the queen's blood.
I heard Zigg saying these words.
What does it mean?
It means that Zigg is the titan of the queen's blood.
His parents were the leaders of the restorers.
It's quite possible.
If we take into account that this is the source of his special powers,
everything falls into place.
It means that the inability to use the power of the progenitor is due to the absence of Flimzik.
You can't meet Zigg.
You can't meet Zigg.
Commander Maggoth, Reiner is being hit!
Now, Marshal, Marley's shield is not that weak.
No.
Now it's not just Marley's shield.
Now the fate of the whole world lies on our shoulders.
We must not just kill the progenitor and leave the problem for later.
Now and here we will eat him
and put an end to the hatred of the two thousand years!
Now and here we will eat him
and put an end to the hatred of the two thousand years!
Now and here we will eat him
Now you will pay
for destroying my city!
Eren, you are not a threat to us alone.
Surrender.
This is where you will end up.
Forward!
Forward!
Let's finish them off!
Enjoy your favorite titanic delicacy
with the gravestones!
What?
What was that?
To be continued...
Hurry up and load the new shell!
Yes, sir!
The brains flew out!
His motor skills have decreased!
Great, Commander Maggoth!
Marshal, who knew that the best artilleryman would become the supreme commander?
The Marley army is so low!
Where are they going?
Damn it, the armored tanks are about to break up!
Enemies!
On the roof!
A whole army!
Their soldiers are helpless, get out of the flank!
Damn it!
They can't stop them!
After all, the Marley soldiers have killed the whole top of the military.
They couldn't restore the army in two months.
With such a pace...
They will eat our parents!
Eren, you are not like everyone else.
You are special.
Let's go!
Let's get rid of him!
The Titan is not very powerful,
but he can quickly break out of the force.
Don't forget,
this operation was built on the Draught of Evil of the Typer.
He risked his life to tell us
how we really need Gerogealus.
The hero who will save the world.
Eren, that's enough.
You lost.
Stop causing pain to others.
Stop suffering on your own.
Onyankapon?
Hey, what's going on outside?
The Marley army has arrived at the Derejabl.
There are about 500 soldiers.
Together with them there is an armored, toothy transporter.
Eren is fighting them alone.
He's fighting with all his might,
but he won't last long.
The Marley will take back their parents.
Help!
We all have to protect Eren!
Go to hell!
Hey, who are we?
This is your war!
Did you think we'd listen?
You traitor!
I'm sorry, but...
If I hadn't obeyed Yelena,
she would have come out of her head.
What?
But you made friends with us!
To capture the Paradis behind our backs
with the help of me!
That's it!
I'm the son of a traitor!
Reiner,
Berdolt,
Annie,
Eren!
I'm sick of this!
Why do we have to help Eren?
So that none of us will have children later!
Hey!
Wait!
Let's listen to him.
Connie.
I honestly didn't know anything.
Not about the wine, not about the plan of merciful death,
like the other volunteers.
What?
I don't think he's lying.
Yelena ordered us to be silent
and not tell the volunteers about the wine.
Most importantly,
I don't want to help the deaths of the Eldians!
We wanted to help the Paradis develop
and defeat Marley together!
That's why we gave up everything and came here.
We lost all our strength for the sake of the people of the island!
All this is due to our belief that the island has a future!
Children are the future!
If the plan of merciful death is fulfilled,
then all our efforts will go to waste!
Please believe me!
I believe you, Armin.
Once you said
that together with the people and the world,
all people exist because someone wished for it.
And the more different peoples, the more interesting they are.
You expressed an idea that is directly contrary to the worldview of Zika.
You are such a man.
Get up, Aniankapon.
Armin.
I believe you too.
But what to do?
To help Eren and Zika
means to fulfill the plan of merciful death.
No, we will stop the plan.
But if we lose them,
we will not protect the island from the rest of the world.
Then what do you suggest?
At least we need to show the world at least once
the threat of the Horde of Earth!
What?
The threat of the Horde of Earth?
Mikasa, what do you think?
Do you want to save Eren?
I want to.
But,
surely,
as Eren said,
because I am Akkerman.
Not at all.
Not at my own will.
What?
I think
it's all pure water in Eren's mind.
I sometimes
really have a headache.
For some reason, I'm sure he's lying.
What do you mean, why?
Are you all serious?
Do you think Eren wants
to die without children?
It's true.
It seemed to me that it didn't look like him.
Even if it can't be.
After all, it's about Eren.
Then why doesn't he change anything about Zika and Eren?
And he doesn't need to change anything.
In the end, only he can decide
how to use the power of the progenitor.
When Elena came to him with the idea of a plan,
Eren had no choice.
Who knows what she would go to,
hearing the refusal.
But if Eren agrees
and convinces her that he is on their side,
then he will be able to set up the Horde of Earth
and protect the island.
Then in the next 50 years
no one will touch Paradis.
This is the Horde of Earth.
During the attack on Marley,
people take up arms and go to the battlefield.
Whether they want it or not.
Far away.
Strike from the ground.
