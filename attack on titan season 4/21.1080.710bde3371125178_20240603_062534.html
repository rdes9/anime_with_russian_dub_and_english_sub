        <pre>Why didn't you show me the rest?
The fact they broke their history could not stay here...
Let me think.
No one knows who I killed today.
What happened after that?
What happened to Carla?
Was there really no other way?
You're standing in front of me, Zigg.
Your dream is not destined to come true.
Everything will be as Aaron wants it to be.
What are you talking about?
I saw the future memories of Aaron.
I couldn't even imagine that everything would turn out to be so horrible.
Zigg?
Is that really you?
How did you grow up?
I'm sorry, I was a terrible father.
Because of me, you suffered so much.
Zigg, I love you.
I wish I had spent more time playing with you.
Dad...
Zigg...
I'm begging you, stop it.
We still haven't reached the point where I've eaten my father.
Is that you?
You pushed your father to kill the King of the Wall and start a war with the whole world?
If the attacking Titan is really able to overcome the flow of time,
you showed Grisha what you needed.
And that's how you influenced the past.
Dad, Grisha...
I tried to forget about Eldia's rebirth,
because from your memory, he learned about the power of the Progenitor,
about the fact that he won't be able to run to her even if he wants to.
However, having taken her, he passed on the power to you.
Since he was able to look into the future,
there is something else ahead.
And you showed him that.
Thank you, brother.
Because you dragged me into the memories of my father,
the current path has arisen.
My dream will come true.
Everything will be as you want.
That's what he said.
Yes.
The memory of my father has opened up to me.
Four years ago, I was able to rule my future.
That's the way it is.
Progenitor!
Make it so that the people and the world will no longer be able to leave their descendants!
It's going in the right direction!
Grisha begged me.
Please, stop Eren.
He immediately regretted that he had obeyed you.
I don't know what future has opened up to you from the memory of your father,
but it is not necessary that you see everything.
For example, you didn't know that you couldn't use the power of the Progenitor here.
You are so...
You are so powerless.
It's useless, Eren.
If the world has begun to act, then stop it.
No one in this world will be able to do it.

You are so smart, Historia.
You already read such books.
But you taught me how to read.
Oh, you have a snot hanging.
Historia, you need to open your eyes.
Open your eyes.
Open your eyes.
Open your eyes.
Historia, you need to develop your femininity.
Well, open your eyes.
So, now it's another matter.
Listen, what does it mean to be feminine?
Probably, to be feminine.
It means to be like this girl.
Historia, do you like her too?
Yes.
This is a good girl who is always ready to help others.
Our world is full of suffering and cruelty.
Therefore, we need to become the one who everyone loves.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
And life helps others.
One of you is guilty of running away from the wine.
Name yourself.
If you don't do this, everyone will poke you in the eye.
The slaves could easily get away alone.
So, you allowed this falsehood.
Good.
You are free.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
My slave and the world.
Your deeds are worthy of praise.
You laid the road, built a tower,
built bridges across the pass.
And from now on, my Yiddish tribe has become quite large.
As a reward for this, I will make you the mother of my descendants.
In the name of my Fritz,
do not exterminate the infidels we hate!
The End
The End
What are you doing?
Get up.
I know you're not afraid of any spear.
My slave and the world.
The End
Eat, my daughters.
Whatever it may be, you must inherit the power and the world.
Eat her body to the last drop.
My daughter.
Rose.
Sin.
My daughters.
Be good.
Multiply the people.
The line of blood and peace must not intersect.
In the deathly hell, feed your serpents to my grandchildren.
When they die, their serpents will eat their descendants.
The End
My future generations, my Eldies,
the power of giants will rule over the land,
my Titans will reign forever.
Where does this world stand?
Forever and ever.
Enough!
I will put an end to this world.
Share with me the power.
You are not a slave and you are not a goddess.
Just a man.
You should not obey.
You have no freedom of will.
The decision is yours.
Choose yourself.
Will you stay here forever?
Or will you let everything end?
What are you doing?
What are you thinking?
Emir!
Obey my order!
Let the people and the world not be born!
I was so far away.
It was you.
Obey me!
Emir!
You have always been waiting.
I am the bearer of the royal blood!
Two thousand years ago,
I was waiting for someone.
I am the bearer of the royal blood!
I am the bearer of the royal blood!
No!
Gabi!
What is it?
It's too big.
It seems to have appeared where Eren was.
Could it be?
It worked.
Eren did it!
I can't hear you.
It's coming out of the sky!
Victory!
What?
Eren has the power of the progenitor!
The power of the progenitor!
The power of the progenitor!
The power of the progenitor!
The power of the progenitor!
The power of the progenitor!
The power of the progenitor!
The desolation of the Earth was activated at once,
so that was Eren's order!
He is going to crush the coalition forces
that are going to Marley!
Eren is our ally!
It's clear!
Zik...
Eren, he's back. He's finally back to us.
That's weird. Wait a minute.
No, no way.
Mikasa!
Even the wall of Mary is being destroyed!
There's no need for so many titans to destroy the allied forces of Marley!
There should be enough outer walls of Shiganshina!
Why attack only on the wall of protection?
If he wants to destroy only the coalition forces in Marley,
then there's no need for that!
I appeal to all people and the world.
Did Eren say that?
My name is Eren JÃ¤ger.
With the help of the power of the progenitor titan,
I can talk to all people from the people and the world.
All the walls of Paradise Island have been removed from the walls.
And all the titans there have begun their actions.
My goal is to protect the inhabitants of Paradise Island,
on which I was born and raised.
But the world has a different goal.
It strives to destroy everyone here to the end.
And the matter will not be limited to the island.
This will not end until all the people from the people and the world die.
And I stand against it.
The titan walls will continue to trample the land beyond the island.
Until those who live there become dust under their feet.

Until those who live there become dust under their feet.
Until those who live there become dust under their feet.
Until those who live there become dust under their feet.
Until those who live there become dust under their feet.
Until those who live there become dust under their feet.
Until those who live there become dust under their feet.
Until those who live there become dust under their feet.
Until those who live there become dust under their feet.
Until those who live there become dust under their feet.
Until those who live there become dust under their feet.
Until those who live there become dust under their feet.
Until those who live there become dust under their feet.
Thank you for watching!
There's a thunder on the ground.
Clubs of dust sink into the sun.
The sun of the titans moves to the horizon.
The walls on the island are now gone.
Next.
Dissolving.
