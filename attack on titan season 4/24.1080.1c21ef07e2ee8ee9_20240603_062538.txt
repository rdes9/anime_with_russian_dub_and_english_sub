Hey, Oliver! What's wrong with you? Hold on!
That's it. There are no more chases.
Levi!
Everyone was turned into titans.
And you survived alone.
Probably for the same reason, while you were still alive with such wounds.
Because you are Ackerman.
What are we going to do now?
We can't stop Zika himself.
We have to trust Armin and Commander Pixis.
Even if Eren betrays Zika,
we can't stop him.
We can't stop him.
We can't stop him.
We can't stop him.
We can't stop him.
Even so, the Yagerists will rule the island with the help of spinal fluid.
And we will stay in the run forever.
It seems our turn has come.
Even when you think you did the right thing.
Here, with the change of time, you end up in the dark.
Let's stay here and live together.
Hey.
Levi.
Now...
Is it really...
Eren, the whole world...
Levi!
Animal shit.
Where is he?
Don't get up.
Zika and the Yagerists went to Shiganshin.
Since then, it's been about half a day.
What happened?
I got lost.
I didn't think he was ready to die.
And I let him go again.
You're not gonna like it.
But now...
If that's the case, and we're gonna hide,
what's left?
Come on.
You heard my conversation with you.
What are you doing there, Master?
Do you believe you're gonna drag me down with a horse?
You definitely won't be able to stay out of it.
Yeah, exactly.
I can't.
My goal is to kill Zika.
Our interests coincide.
Teo Magat, Bigfinger.
Levi Ackerman.
I heard you can't beat the nine titans by force.
But now...
How will you be able to get away from my bullets?
I can't do anything.
But...
I felt like an enemy myself in such a pitiful state.
To shoot or to listen...
The choice is yours.
Then before the shot, let me ask you.
You said you wanted to kill Zika.
Where is he now?
Most likely.
Aaron is holding him to use the Queen's blood.
No.
The Titan is already a progenitor.
I see you know almost everything.
An expert on the Hanje titans.
Even more than us, Marley.
And the progenitor titan, have you seen him personally?
I know he's incredibly huge.
And it seems like we can't do anything with him.
So...
So we have no other choice.
Let's unite like everyone else.
To be continued...
To be continued...
How am I supposed to feed my mom, Falco?
I have to use my strength.
But if I hurt him and he understands that he has the power of the titans,
then it's over.
You can't make mistakes.
You have to come up with some kind of a good way.
What a simple-minded boy.
He doesn't even complain that he has to spend the night under the open sky.
He could have suspected me.
But instead he trusts me.
He trusts me.
Damn it!
Sasha.
You would understand me.
Excuse me.
Aren't we going to the hospital?
Why in an abandoned village?
Well...
I want to show you something interesting.
This is the village of Raghako.
How did you know?
Last night I heard you talking to yourself.
Sasha, is this your accomplice that Gabby shot at the beehive?
You knew who I was, but you pretended.
You pretended that you didn't know and brought me here.
Why?
Do you want to take revenge on me?
No.
It was a shot at the beehive.
I understand.
Don't worry, this is a lying titan.
He hasn't been moving for several years.
Did you want to show it to me?
But why?
I want you to help me clean his teeth.
You don't often get a chance like this, do you?
Look, you need to have a good tool from top to bottom.
Let's take care of it, and then we'll think about it.
Okay.
Do you agree?
Okay.
Falco!
Get away from him!
Gabby!
He wants to feed you a titan!
Pony!
Stop!
Don't move!
Not a step closer!
Pony!
Shut up!
I don't want to hear anything!
You don't understand anyway!
You say it will be better to leave him alive,
so you can forget your mom!
You're always right!
You can understand a fool like me!
Falco!
Use the power of Zubastov!
The power of Zubastov?
Not with Goliath!
No!
Stop, Falco!
Gabby!
Forgive me, Pony!
Who said not a step closer?
Tell me something, Armin!
I just said it myself!
So, I'm gonna show you what it's all about!
Armin!
Brother!
If I hadn't saved you, what would you do?
I would have turned your mother into a human form.
By giving her a super-large titan,
what would have caused her suffering?
That's what I know.
When I was escorting her,
my mother told me to become a real soldier.
But her son almost killed a child with his friend.
That's what kind of soldier I became.
Yeah.
Me too.
I couldn't replace the commander.
Armin,
I want to become a soldier that my mother would be proud of.
So,
let's go help those who are in trouble.
I found it.
I'm glad to see you.
Were you looking for me?
Or was it Sharf?
I guessed you took him.
I'm sorry,
but I wanted to get closer to you.
I got a shrapnel in my stomach.
I can't get it anymore.
I can't see the free world
that Eren J채ger will create.
Such a pity.
I managed to talk to J채ger a little bit
about you.
He said he wanted me to throw the ball.
But I decided not to throw it away,
but to leave it to myself.
Give it back.
I became a soldier
because I admired you.
And I don't regret anything.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I don't regret anything.
Because I lived in pursuit of you.
I give my heart to what I believe in.
Is the Titan's tail another part of the Earth?
Finally, the Earth will stop shaking.
And it seemed to me
to hear the sound of a bell
that declares freedom.
Our Ildian Empire
for hundreds of years
has been under the persecution of the whole world.
But this is the end.
Now we are free.
Thanks to Eren J채ger
the Ildians have won.
Hey, Mikasa,
don't you want to join the Ildians
and join the government?
I don't care.
But it's too late to waste time.
Give back your hearts!
Give back your hearts!
Give back your hearts!
Give back your hearts!
Give back your hearts!
Give back your hearts!
Glory to the Ildians!
Give back your hearts!
I'll give this drink to J채ger!
Now it's better to hurry up to Reiner.
Don't worry.
He will wake up in a deep sleep in two or three days.
Was it really worth turning here?
First you need to fill your stomachs.
Listen, Armin, are you sure?
If all the Titans have been removed from the abyss,
then probably Enia lived too.
Enia!
What?
Enia!
What?
Enia!
I found the cake!
Enia, stop it!
I even smudged myself.
That's her first cake in four years.
I'm sorry, the queue was so long.
It's gone now.
Hitch,
I happened to meet Armin and Conny.
We decided to go further together.
I'm leaving right now.
I'm sorry for everything.
Thank you for talking to me these four years.
Goodbye.
Your gloomy neighbor.
Oh, I won't eat it all by myself.
People of the Empire!
Thank you for coming!
And now,
here will be the execution of two volunteers who dared to go against the Ildian Empire!
At this moment,
we, the Yagerists,
inherit the aspirations of the era for world domination
and proclaim our power over the island of Paradis!
In the name of this criminal, Elena,
she rose up against Marley
and supported the Ildian Empire,
but her true goal
was to allow Zika to apply the power of the progenitor
and fulfill his plan of merciful death,
to completely exterminate the Ildians!
I was and remained a dirty Ildian!
Although Eran had defeated Zika,
Kisa broke his plan!
The criminal has always been his faithful servant!
Let the water burn!
Elena!
Your last words!
You'll be shooting soon.
Die, stranger!
The people and the world are not for you!
Only those who have blood and peace will remain!
Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!
Not the time yet!
The criminal, Anyanko Pond,
he did not know about the plan of merciful death
and worked well for the benefit of the Ildians,
but he said that it would be better to die
than to live under the rule of the Ildian Empire!
You can still change your mind!
I helped the Ildians to save their native land from Marley,
but it was also for the sake of the Ildians.
And as a result of my help,
my motherland will be destroyed
and my whole family will be killed!
What now?
Do you really only have
the anger of the Ildians among you?
My life is so expensive
to get close to you!
You should know how unfair it is
when you are killed for nothing!
You should know how unfair it is
when you are killed for nothing!
Why can't you understand me?
Don't be silent! Say something, Jean!
Hey!
Shit! I missed!
What are you doing?
Flock!
This is the titan-transporter!
He's running away!
He ate Elena and Jean!
Damn!
Where is Mikasa?
Right now!
He...
Mikasa?
Where is she?
Did you hear that?
Four shots in a row.
This is Jean's signal for the start of the operation.
We've got enough weapons and provisions.
Their attention is focused on the other side of the citadel.
Let's go!
Someone's looking at us.
What should we do, Armin?
Let's go!
Hurry up, Mikasa!
I've never been so big.
I don't like titans.
I don't like titans.
The transporter can stay in the form of a titan for months.
Don't you clean your teeth?
How rude to say, where can I be?
And when did you unite with Marley?
Last night.
Are you sure?
Because if you joined the Yegorists,
you would get a warm place.
Yes.
I would like to shut my ears
and lock myself in the room.
But the ashes of burnt bones
will haunt me all my life.
Jean, I don't understand what you're talking about.
But thank you.
Go and wash yourself.
Why?
Me too.
Your capture was a condition for the help of the transporter.
They told me to let you live.
Get up.
Linnia?
Calm down, Reiner.
Don't worry.
We're all here.
We don't have time.
Let's go.
Where?
To save this world.
To save this world.
To save this world.
To save this world.
To save this world.
To save this world.
To save this world.
To save this world.
To save this world.
To save this world.
To save this world.
To save this world.
To save this world.
To save this world.
To save this world.
To save this world.
To save this world.
To save this world.
To save this world.
To save this world.
To save this world.
To save this world.
To save this world.
To save this world.
To save this world.
To save this world.
To save this world.
To save this world.
Despite everything
But I still
I still protect you
Despite everything
Despite everything
I'll never doubt
Righteousness is
The more you believe
In yourself
Fire and war
We hated each other, despised each other and killed each other.
And now, what is waiting for us behind the fire?
Next, the night of the end.
