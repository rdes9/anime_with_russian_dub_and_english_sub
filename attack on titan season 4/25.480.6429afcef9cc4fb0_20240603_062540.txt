I will ask in the best district of the capital, of course,
that in the morning, that in the afternoon,
I will drink the highest kind of alcohol.
And no one will say a word to me.
I deserve the right to give happiness to my wife,
to my child and even to my grandchildren.
Jean, it's me.
I'm waiting for you outside.
I didn't notice.
I didn't hear anything.
Don't go. Don't think.
If you just sit down right now,
and you have a house in the best district of the capital,
sit down.
Thank you for coming, Jean.
Mikasa just described the situation to me.
I'm sorry I wasn't there with you.
You did well in such terrible conditions, guys.
Olivia is in good shape, but he's alive.
He won't be able to fight soon.
Besides, we have united with the remnants of the Marley forces,
including the Titan Transporter.
To stop Eren, we can't cut out whole peoples.
How can we stop him?
First, we'll get our allies.
Our opportunities are limited.
But without you and one of the nine Titans,
we can't do anything.
The former military order has collapsed,
and I'm no longer your commander.
So I'm just asking.
I agree.
I don't want Eren to continue his killing.
Even if it's for the sake of protecting our island.
But I want to stop him.
Mikasa.
Even if we can stop Eren,
what do we do next?
If he keeps the power of his parents
and lives only four more years,
what will happen to the island?
After all, for many years,
hatred for the world will not disappear.
If we can stop Eren,
it will mean destroying the island.
I think it's like this.
Marley sees that immediately after the attack,
the earthquake began.
At least,
they will soon decide to go to the island again.
If we don't destroy the island to the ground,
then someday they will destroy the whole world.
This will cause the rage of the world to be stronger
and the entire world will be in danger.
It is possible.
But in any case, until the island dies,
we have several years.
Well, we were looking for options, and the time has come.
And we didn't decide anything.
So Eren decided to lose ...
Genad, this is wrong.
And nothing will convince me in this.
I'm sorry,
I shouldn't have shouted.
Jan, you're right, Eren became like this
because of my stupid idealism.
And let me fight about it now.
But I used to want to run away,
give up everything,
forget everything and just live.
But I'm still the commander
of the scouts.
I feel like our comrades,
who gave their hearts for the freedom of mankind,
are looking at me.
Most of them died without knowing
that people are beyond the walls.
But enough of what will be free
only our island.
No one of them will say such a distant filth.
The last chance to stop the slaughter.
Now.
Hange,
I'm still a scout.
To be continued.
Come on, help me.
Don't shoot each other in the eye.
to share food with those who used to fight to the death?
I wonder why they decided to change their minds.
Because if you don't stop Eren Yeager, you'll get the world you've been dreaming of.
A paradise for the island devils.
After all, just a little bit more, and we would have hindered the meeting of Eren and Zeke.
If only you didn't help them.
We've already explained everything to you, Mr. Marshal.
We don't want a world war.
Otherwise, we wouldn't have been hiding in the forest right now.
And we wouldn't have been cooking ragu on the fire.
So you saw justice on their side?
Justice?
You're talking about justice now?
You...
And we're angry when we fought the titans you were killing us with.
Listen to me.
We fought with all our might.
Because they wanted to feed the titans.
You want to say it's the devil's job, old man?
Yes.
I see you're the devil.
The theory of the threat of paradise has come true.
And now we're on the verge of death.
This is the result of your fighting with all your might.
Am I wrong?
You know what?
If they didn't break through the wall and didn't eat Aran's mother right in front of him,
he wouldn't have become like this.
You're the ones who crushed him.
Hey, do you want to talk about history?
Do you realize that Eldia was the first to destroy Marley
and caused a lot of suffering to her people?
Aren't you tired of playing the victim for 2,000 years?
Well, well.
It's like I'm talking to a child.
Do you think you're great?
A good argument against 2,000 years of real history?
What?
Stop it.
It's stupid to argue over such old events that no one of us has ever seen.
Jean, it's hard for the Marshal to understand our very existence.
He is surprised by such strange devils as we are,
who want to save the world at the cost of their paradise,
when this world has long tried to destroy us.
After all, we have lived in the outer world for several months
and we cannot become the devils who know nothing again.
So what?
Do you think you can kill him?
Erina, can you kill him?
This is not the only way to stop him.
I knew you would say that.
And what methods?
Convince him, or what?
Do you think you can convince him
who is ready to take over most of humanity?
We will not know this until we talk to Erin.
Let's say you talk to him,
and he still does not want to stop the massacre.
What's next?
You don't know because you don't have the brains to understand that Erin is the enemy?
As I thought,
if we try to kill Erin for the sake of Marley,
then you will join us in the fight to protect him.
Certainly.
After all, it will be so.
Mikasa,
you can't even imagine
who is more important to you than Meron.
So I should be killed?
What?
Leonkart!
Leonkart!
I understand your feelings well.
I also want to stop Erin for one reason.
I don't want to let him kill my father in Marley.
That's why I need your help.
If Erin manages to stop the plot,
let it be so.
But before that, we shouldn't argue.
All right.
Come here, come here, come here.
Well, the horns are ready.
It's time to eat.
Even with the resting horses,
it will take at least five hours to get to the harbor.
All hope is on Azumabit.
According to Kiyomi,
they brought a flying boat to the harbor
to watch over the gulf of the earth.
We can get to the titans and their parents on it.
After all, Azumabit is behind the wheel.
The question is where the titan and its parents are.
If we fly to the gulf, the fuel will run out quickly.
That's why we took her prisoner.
Where is the first target of the Jäger?
How should I know?
And if I knew,
what would I tell you?
After all, the Jäger does not know anything about these rivers,
except what you told him.
He should have planned the direction of the gulf of the earth in advance.
You probably have some guesses.
Bastard.
What?
I'm asking you,
why should I help the Marley bastard?
Because your life is in our hands.
It's useless.
She wants to die.
But you fought against Marley for the sake of your homeland.
Do you want me to be crushed too?
Elena?
She doesn't care.
Because she is the same Marley bastard as I am.
You were ahead of us, Elena.
We carefully studied your past and learned a lot of amazing things.
You were born and raised in the most ordinary Marley family,
but after the first meeting with Sikom, you pretended
that you were born and raised in the Marley country.
You were disappointed in Marley and came up with a fairy tale for yourself.
A wonderful fairy tale where you and the prince save the world.
You decorated it with a spoon and decided to make it part of the history of mankind.
Such enthusiasm is worthy of praise.
Save the world.
Are there any words that are more beautiful and attractive for the human ear?
You dive into the noble idea of saving hundreds of millions of souls
and greedily swallow it again, trying to erase all traces of former hatred.
That's how you look in my eyes now.
Come on, I'll refresh your memory a little.
Reiner Braun.
How many aliens were burned by the titans after you made a hole in the wall?
Eni Leonhart.
You killed a lot of scouts too.
At the same time, you trampled a lot of peaceful residents of Stochis.
Oh yes, and you too, gentlemen from Paradis.
Usually you are so considerate, but the Marley court carried out a rude and merciless task.
Armin.
I wonder how you, a mountain of corpses, including ordinary people, have promoted your achievements.
I have not forgotten your heroic deeds in Liberio.
Especially yours, Jean.
In order to defeat the transporter, you bravely launched a thunderbolt right into the young falcon sitting here.
And then, the same young Gabi sitting here shot Sasha.
Sasha was such a good girl.
Even I was sad.
It's true.
Since childhood, you lived like a family and hated your sadness.
There is no comparison with mine.
It's very tasty, Hange.
Do you have more?
Yes, I have a lot more.
Thank you, Elena.
You help us reveal the hidden evil and set our minds on the right track.
Yes, for the sake of your unfulfilled fantasies, my dear friends, my brain went crazy.
But everything went to hell and now you want to die.
What a carelessness.
Oh yes, I almost forgot.
What was his name?
Your best friend, whom you once told about.
That's right, Marco.
It seems that it was said that he was involved in the death.
Have you already heard from her about Marco's death?
I took it from Marco, his private.
Therefore, the titans easily...
They simply followed my order.
Marco heard my conversation with Bertold and found out more.
I was afraid that he would give us.
I decided that it was easy to keep the secret if I fed Marco to the titans.
And then I pushed him to the roof in flight.
I pressed him so that he could not move.
And I ordered them to take him away.
Marco could not escape anywhere and sacrificed the titan.
Marco said something before death.
He said that we could not even talk to him.
That's right, that's right.
We did not even talk.
Therefore, we did not reach the point that we were ready to catch each other in the throat.
It's not too late now.
We fought so fiercely and tried to kill each other.
But now we have removed the weapons and calmly communicate.
Who could have imagined that we would sit in the fire and eat from the same pot?
When I saw how the titan ate Marco, I thought why Marco was eating.
After that, I gave up all my anger and killed that titan.
I blame you for this, Marco.
Enough!
Your emotional mind is damaged.
Do not forgive me.
I'm just not in the mood for this.
Enough already!
Sorry.
Hey, Jean!
Do not!
Stop it!
Jean!
Gabi!
Gabi!
I'm sorry.
We were going to kill all of you who live on Paradis.
So that the world would accept us and forgive us.
We wanted all the devils on the island to disappear.
And now we are so lucky.
Mom, Dad, and everyone else in Liberia.
Forgive us.
I understand that we are too insolent to forgive you.
But we need your help.
Please.
Please help us.
Please.
Please stop the Earth Goal together.
Please.
Please.
Please.
Please.
Please.
Please.
Please.
Let me go.
Where are you going, Jean?
Jean, you didn't take your supplement.
It's useless.
It's useless.
He's gone.
Gabi.
They broke up.
Get up.
It's time to leave.
Will you help us?
Yes.
Of course.
Come on, stop whining, Rainer.
Your wounds have healed a long time ago.
Gabi.
I'm sorry I hit you.
Does it hurt?
No, it doesn't hurt anymore.
I'm fine.
I see.
Rainer, I won't change in front of you.
Yes.
And don't.
And me?
And me.
The transporter.
Stop.
Something's happened.
The harbour...
The harbour has been captured by the Egerists.
They must have overtaken us on the railroad.
There are many soldiers with anti-tank equipment.
All of them are ready for battle.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
In order to save the world, you need to stop Zoran.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
