Look carefully, Zig. This is Liberio, our headquarters.
Compared to the world, it is small like a bird's cage.
We must spend all our days here, never leaving it.
Zig, do you want to get out of here?
Yes, I want to.
Oh, I didn't expect that.
It's not often that we have guests at such an early hour.
I'll be back a little later.
No, we're leaving already.
Ah, so you're the Eldians.
What are you doing?
We have permission to leave the ghetto.
I'm a cleaner in this tower.
My job is to clean it from the dirt.
And you're dirtying my workplace, devils.
The descendants of the devils that cut out whole peoples.
You continue to breed children and multiply.
There's no need to leave the ghetto.
Get out of here!
Remember how it should be, Zig.
Such is the outer world.
If you don't like it, you have to change it.
Zig, you'll save us all.
THE END
THE END
THE END
The only salvation.
Someone of these children will become my heir.
Yes, they will take one.
Some boy has fallen behind.
Who is he?
Ah, JÃ¤ger again.
All the other children, despite their young age,
try their best to get the title of Honorable Marley.
But I don't see any break in him.
Why did he even come to us?
How's the training, Zig?
It's going very hard.
I see.
But you'll definitely be able to become a warrior.
You have special powers.
Yes, you're special because you're our boy.
Dad, Mom, look after Zig today.
Okay.
Today I baked your favorite pie.
Hooray!
Oh, that's great.
Zig is lonely without you.
But I want to strengthen the health of Liberia.
One day Zig will understand what we worked on.
This is the Laga tragedy that happened 1200 years ago.
The great city of Laga disappeared from the face of the earth.
The Titans continued their offensive.
They followed the devastation of Montaigne,
the destruction of Valle.
As a result, the Eldian Empire destroyed hundreds of thousands of Marley people.
Those few who managed to escape from Laga wandered through the wastelands in disarray.
But the Eldian Empire prevented them from leaving the Titans.
And at dawn, when the Titans woke up, the Marley people...
I understand.
A lot of people died.
Dad will definitely teach you the right stories.
Eldians have done terrible things with the Marley people in the past,
so now we have to pay for it.
Zig, do you want to become a warrior and fight for the Marley?
Yes.
I want to become a warrior.
Well...
Well, it's time to go to bed.
Oh, yes.
Let's read the book about the cat house next time.
Hooray!
Let's begin!
Let's begin!
You're not doing very well, Dad.
Dad!
Zig?
We finished earlier today, come on!
Oh, great.
Then you can study longer.
So...
There was never a Laga tragedy.
And the desertion of Monta with the destruction of Walla too.
All this is only beneficial for the Marley imagination.
Since ancient times, the Eldians have not had such a cruel world.
Besides...
I would never wish such a thing about my parents and the world.
Never.
Exactly.
You're starting to understand, Zig?
Yes.
If there is no rupture, then leave.
Marley, only those who are ready to give everything for the Motherland are needed.
And a Jew like you will never trust the titan of our country.
Hey!
Boy!
You can throw this ball at me.
You're still a kid, you're not bad at throwing.
Catch.
Great catch.
I'm tired of playing with the wall.
You won't keep me company for a while.
Marley warriors, who do you want to become?
The truth is from my animal-like.
There is a lot of sense in the war, so I play here with a ball.
Tom Xavier.
My real profession is a scientist-titanologist.
Well, what's your name?
Zig Yeager!
Zig...
Zig Yeager!
Zig Yeager!
Zig, I see talent in you.
And you'll get a great pitcher.
I'm home!
Dad, today...
We didn't agree on that!
What does it mean, Grace?
If we don't make Zig a warrior, then our plan is over!
The owl says that before he can get into the titanic category,
Zig himself must earn high marks.
I know.
The second chance won't come in a hundred years.
But Zig still has a chance.
Yes, exactly.
Zig can do it.
I'm sorry.
Zig!
You can do it!
Because you're our boy!
I told you, you don't need Marley.
Why did you come?
To show my loyalty to Marley and to atone for my sins!
Let me participate in the open training!
Why are you frozen, Yeager?
Run!
Move your feet!
Damn it!
Not this one!
Don't say that!
He did his best for everyone!
But still!
He'll never become a warrior!
Well, you got it, didn't you?
Nothing funny.
Since then, I've only been a boy for ten years.
And I've never been a girl for ten years.
Since then, I've only been a boy for ten years.
And I've never been a girl for ten years.
It didn't seem to me that you wanted to become a warrior.
I have to become one.
And still, nothing works out.
I can understand.
It's stupid for you to become a warrior.
To shorten your life for Marley,
to attack other countries.
It's a stupid idea.
Sawyer, why did you become a warrior?
Because I wanted to know the secrets of the Titans.
After all, I'm a scientist after all.
It seems that it all started when the great-granddaughter of the world met something.
I want to know what happened then.
I even gave up part of my life to dig into the memories of the Titans.
That's why I'm completely useless at war.
However, compared to the secrets of the Titans,
hating war is such a stupid thing.
So, you and I are two Sapegapara.
All this military madness will come to us.
We are a rarity in this world.
We are worthy people.
Everything is for the best.
Even if I never get out of the ghetto,
the main thing is that I will live.
Zik.
Finally, the Monopolis are after us.
It seems they call themselves the Restorers of Meldea.
This time they have everything.
The traitor organized them under the pseudonym of the Owl.
We already have several clues.
We just need to collect evidence.
The rest is a matter of time.
Zik?
What's going on?
Eat faster.
My stomach hurts.
Dad. Mom.
Please don't play with fire anymore.
If they catch us, they will send us all to hell.
They will send demons to the island
and turn them into giants.
For all this time, you have not learned anything from me.
If no one rises,
we will die like nothing in the darkness behind these walls.
Exactly.
We said that this battle was for you and all the Eldians in the future.
Even if because of her,
the same thing happens to me as with Aunt Faye.
Zik!
Faye was killed because our world is arranged wrong.
We must fight for the sake of the fact that no one has achieved her fate.
We will take the strong Eldia from Marley
and fight off our legal rights.
What a nightmare.
Your parents are restorers.
So, all the family will be sent to heaven right away.
Yes.
Ksaver.
Thank you for playing with me.
When I become a giant, I will sometimes remember you.
Well, I'll go.
Give them up.
There is no other way out.
Take care of them yourself
and prove Marley's loyalty.
Then they will spare you and Grandma and Grandpa.
But how? I can't.
Zik!
Your parents did wrong to you.
They waved at you and didn't care at all.
They never loved you.
Zik.
It's not your fault.
You're smart.
And a good boy.
You can feel a little better, Zik.
Yeah.
It's hard for the old man, isn't it?
Hey, she's not that old.
Ksaver!
Ksaver!
It seems that my term of possession of the titans is coming to an end.
Probably.
I couldn't live to old age,
but I don't regret that I gave up on science.
In the end, I managed to publish my collection.
Yeah? What did you find out?
What types of influence do the titan-predator have on the people and the world?
Ah, like manipulations with memories?
And not only with memories.
He can even change the work of the body.
About 600 years ago,
there was a terrible disease in the world and the population dropped sharply.
However, on one fine day,
this attack disappeared from the Zaldi Empire.
The king took advantage of the power of the titan-predator
and remade the structure of the body of his people.
We, the people and the world, wherever we are,
we are part of the titan-predator.
Well, it's scary, isn't it?
Then...
Why did they give birth to another devil?
The titan-predator will be able to make the people and the world unable to give birth to children?
And if the descendants of the world stop giving birth,
then in 100 years there will be no titans left in the whole world.
People will no longer have to live in fear of the titans and constantly suffer.
And in general, it would be better if we did not give birth.
Then we would not suffer!
Ksover!
I didn't tell you,
but I had a family.
When I was young and stupid, I took off my bandage,
hid my nationality and married the wife who gave birth to me a son.
My wife was a marlika,
but the lie could not last forever.
My wife found out that I was a liar
and cut her son's throat.
I became a warrior only because I was looking for the most extravagant way to commit suicide.
But during these 13 years,
I went to study the titans with my head
and met you and played the ball.
It was fun.
I was looking for a dead son in you,
trying to run away from my sins with the help of the titan force.
If only I had not been born in this world at all!
I inherit the titan beast,
but not for the sake of the marlika.
I will lead the operation to success
on the return of the progenitor and save the world.
I will rid all people of fear of the titans
and free the pagans from the titans!
There is one thing that I did not tell the marlika.
The way to break the oath of peace.
It happened so, Zik,
that it is possible thanks to you.
The contact of the titan of the royal blood
with the owner of the progenitor's titan
is capable of extracting the power of the last.
However, you will not be the one to use it.
The decision remains with the master of the progenitor.
In other words, your role is the key.
Believe in the progenitor, the one you can trust.
The one who understands our plan of merciful death,
you will definitely be able to find such a person.
I will always be watching over you,
Zik.
I will find him, dad.
Eren Yeager?
Yes, he is the owner of the progenitor's titan.
Besides, Eren said that in Shigansh
in the basement of his home
some important information was hidden.
I see.
Did Eren say anything about his father?
It seems that now he has disappeared without a trace,
and before he worked as a doctor.
That's the news!
Dad still survived!
Eren, we are victims.
He definitely brainwashed you.
And someday I will definitely save you!
You look a little like your father.
To begin with, Eren,
thank you for accepting the request to come here.
My ideas have already been told to you by Elena.
So you support the plans of merciful death of the Jews?
Four years ago,
one incident opened to me the memories of my father.
Memories of the days when he killed the whole family of the king behind the walls.
He smeared like bugs still very small children.
Their feelings were preserved on the skin.
If they remained alive,
the progenitors would have returned to the royal family
and he would have been bound by the oath of peace.
And this would have led us, humanity, behind the walls to death.
The death of children gave us life.
I see.
Your father was right.
That's what you thought, right?
No, my father was wrong.
In addition,
I am also his mistake, which he grew up.
If the Jews had not been born,
your inhabitants of this city
would not have had to become victims of our future plan.
Not to be born in this world
is the greatest salvation.
I'll do what I have to do.
With my own hands,
I will put an end to the two-thousand-year power of the Titans.
And until this day comes, we must move forward.
Isn't that right, brother?
Yes. Yes.
That's right.
I touched it.
I would like to hold your hand tight,
but now it is better for us not to touch each other.
Instead, here, take this ball.
Aaron,
we will definitely bring salvation to everyone.
The only salvation.
Merciful death, L.D.
What did you say?
Merciful death?
You will soon die in the body of a stinky giant,
listening to your own body being chewed up.
For you, this is more than an easy death,
taking into account how many of our friends you have ruined.
I did not ruin anyone,
but only saved
saved the children who were born with them
from this, this cruel world.
I see your legs are growing again.
Ksaver!
Look at me!
Ksaver!
Ksaver!
Ksaver!
The path to the future you want does not intersect.
All that remains is to fight for your beliefs.
Where it all began, in Shiganshina.
Next, the sky and the earth.
