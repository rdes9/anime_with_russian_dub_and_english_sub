Oh, what was that?
Some kind of thunder.
A lightning strike?
A thunderbolt.
What happened there?
There must be something in that direction.
What is it?
I think it's because...
JERRY
How did...
...it get...
...quietly...
Dense?!
Here it is...
To be continued...
To be continued...

So the day came when we gathered at the dinner table again.
Everything happened as I said, Commander Pixis.
Thank you for your immediate reaction.
You forbade the soldiers to resist and gathered all the troops here in Shiganshina, as we demanded.
A new choice for those who drank brain fluid from the back was removed.
It is not known when we will be turned into titans.
Therefore, the only place for us is here, where all the inhabitants were taken out.
In addition, what else is left to do when several of our own people are looking for weapons in the back?
Please forgive me, Commander.
My son and I drank that wine.
And how long have you betrayed us?
You do not have to answer.
Forgive me.
Apparently, the sooner someone has changed, the better his position in the new state.
The white bandage that they wear with pride says that its owners are gypsies, right?
And the red bandage indicates those who were drunk with brain fluid from the back and threatened to obey.
But to us, fools, who were successfully drunk with wine, but did not say anything, black marks were tied.
It reminds me of Marley's methods.
Isn't that the way she ruled your conquered lands?
The enemy can learn a lot.
For example, how to start new enemies.
Didn't you yourself refuse to accept us as allies?
As a result, we did not believe the guests who from the very beginning treated us with poisoned wine.
Was it a wise decision or stupid?
You were both fools and wise.
If you had just trusted us and Zeke, then we would have saved the world together.
You say we would have saved the world?
Your plan was to arrange a meeting with Zeke and Aaron, launch a gulf of land of a small scale and make all other countries stay away from our island for 50 years.
It turns out that only one island would be saved.
Yelena?
It's too late for everything.
Zeke has been waiting for you for a long time.
And in response to his mercy, you decided to stab him in the back.
Zeke is a god who brings salvation to the world, so his punishment will fall on you.
What now?
Are we going to sit here and just watch the development of events?
Have some tea.
Thank you.
Armin, can you get out of here with the help of the titan?
No.
They can only blow up the city.
A super-sized titan is not capable of careful action.
Not like Aaron.
Well, why did Aaron beat you up?
Isn't it time to tell us?
His words hurt Mikasa.
What?
What exactly hurt Mikasa?
You understand?
Don't.
Enough.
No, it's not enough.
Tell me what words hurt her.
Stop it, Jean.
It's clear.
Aaron turned into a complete scum.
He forgot so much that he caused pain to those who hit him for no reason.
If Aaron was still in his mind, I don't think he would have done that for no reason.
That is, he has some kind of hidden motive.
I'm glad to see you again, gentlemen Shiganshin heroes.
I'm very sorry that we meet in such an environment.
Hey!
And you with them!
Hey!
Hey!
Let us out!
Do you want a little?
You yourself arrested me and dragged me along the whole island.
Sit here peacefully until Aaron meets Zika.
Well, you know ...
That's so much joy, isn't it, Ilya?
Everything worked out and the mood is what you need.
Thanks to you, Aaron dances to the beat of Zika.
They arranged an attack on Marlene.
Thanks to you, Aaron dances to the beat of Zika.
They arranged an attack on Marlene.
They volunteered with the support of the people of Judea.
And with the help of wine with spinal-brain fluid, they subdued their army.
Now you have Judea in your hands and the power of the titan of the progenitor.
It remains only to destroy Marlene and avenge your country.
After all, it was for this that you came to our island.
But we brought you progress.
The island from the last century.
What?
Just so you can live comfortably.
Then, when you become the rulers of the island,
you gave yourself to be deceived and lost.
No more, no less.
Gris!
I see you sold us so that you would be raised to the nines of Elena.
Damn it!
Completely stupid.
It was you who sang with the devils and betrayed us.
What?
You got lost without memory in that stinking potato, devilish work.
I'll tear your head off right now!
Wait, Nicola!
Every evening I was talking about this woman endlessly.
And I'm a fool.
I thought you would come to your senses when the whore died.
What did you just say?
Then I will express myself more clearly.
This whore is a dirty witch.
Elena!
I apologize for his rudeness.
On this island, those who call you demons are no longer needed.
And please believe me,
our true goal is not some kind of empty stupidity like the revenge of Marley.
We want to break the world chain of hatred
and save not only El Dio, but even Marley.
Allow me to tell you everything without a secret.
The secret plan of Zika to save the world,
the plan of merciful death.
They are demons.
Why do I need all this?
Hello, killer Sasha.
What do you want?
Help me if you want to save Falcon.
Help you?
How?
Call for help on the radio.
Call for help on the radio.
So that the saboteurs who penetrated the walls give themselves up.
Don't move.
Gabi, you sit quietly.
Pic!
Quietly.
Is that you?
The same Aaron Yeager.
Right.
Gabi, point that rifle at Aaron.
Gabi.
Aaron, you're not hands out of pockets.
What if I don't obey?
I'll press the trigger and your brains will fly off the floor.
No one will ever see you.
I'll press the trigger and your brains will fly off the floor.
No one will ever see you.
You won't have time to turn into a titan.
So what?
You're not going to shoot?
If you're not going to press the trigger, why did you come?
What if I'm not hands out of pockets?
You won't be able to find out.
Because your brains...
No, I know.
You won't shoot.
Because you're not allowed to kill a pro-parent titan.
Your order is to capture pro-parents at any cost.
Even now.
You still have to turn into a titan and eat me alive.
Am I right?
Pic!
Gabi, get your finger off the trigger.
You will pay for a serious violation of the order.
Not only you, but your family in the ghetto.
Yes, I can't shoot.
And I doubt that I'll be able to eat you.
That's the way it is.
Pic!
You found the traces of the titan that I left when I got in here.
I was going to go deeper until you had time to do something.
Well, it's good that I was able to get here.
There is another reason that did not let me shoot.
If you use the power of the pro-parent,
then you will surely defeat Marley.
There will be no chance of victory.
You would not turn against yourself the whole world.
But what can bring victory, except for the power of the pro-parent?
Pic, what are you saying?
Gabi, drop the rifle already.
In that case, what do you want?
Free the liars from the power of Marley and everything else.
I want to get my family out of the ghetto as soon as possible.
I have only one father left of my relatives.
And I became a warrior to get him good doctors.
My father's life was able to last.
But when he found out that my term was coming to an end,
he was sad.
Before I die and leave him alone,
I want to personally show him the bright future of Ildia.
I want to personally show him the bright future of Ildia.
And for that, you have to crush Marley.
I will help as much as I can.
And if you beat all the Marley people,
then I'm ready for anything.
The attack on Marley was set up by the traitor Zig.
And you are there too.
Why did we fight all this time?
We thought that if the world recognizes us as good-natured Ildians,
then someday Ildia will be free.
Aren't you the same traitor as Zig?
Gabi, who are we to you?
Marley people? Ildians?
What do you think?
We are honorable Marley people.
Wrong. We are the people and the world.
This is the only irrefutable truth.
No matter what nation we are,
we will remain a race that turns into the Titans.
As you saw in the fortress of glory,
sooner or later the strength of the Titans will be useless.
That is, we will cease to be needed by Marley
and we will all be spent.
Even if we show ourselves as good-natured Ildians,
the day of liberation will never come.
The only way out is to fight for your rights.
Prove to me.
If you really want to help us,
then show me the evidence.
I will point out where my comrades are hiding in this city.
How?
If we go up to the roof,
I can point with my finger.
Okay.
Children will cease to be born?
Exactly.
This is the plan of the merciful death of Zika.
The Titans will disappear from the world
and all the suffering that they bring to their existence
slowly and peacefully.
No, wait, what is peaceful here?
If the people and the world will be lost until they die,
then in the last few years there will be only scoundrels and old men.
And who will then defend the country?
Just leave us alone?
For this, as before,
for the God of the Earth to serve the forces of restraint,
it is necessary to preserve the forefathers and the royal family.
Fortunately, the Queen of History has already given us an heir.
Until his life comes to an end,
several people from the people and the world will be transferred to the forefathers.
Do you want to say that the plan is undeniable?
Undeniable, perfect.
Not a single country can boast of it.
Each of them has its own problems.
Only one thing remains certain.
The incredible threat of the Titans.
There are those who can put an end to the history
soaked in tears and blood.
Zika and Eren.
I don't know how many thousand years have left for mankind,
but will there be more people capable of such a great deed?
These two brothers will become a symbol
that will pass through the millennia,
like the ancient gods that we are talking about now.
And after death, they will become the saving sun
that illuminates mankind with its light.
Are you not well?
No.
I didn't think you had such noble intentions.
They touch to the depths of the soul.
Nice to hear.
I'm glad you understood us.
Yelena!
Hurry up and come to us, the saboteurs!
The enemies have penetrated here!
They killed one of ours!
This is the Titan, the transporter.
They say she betrayed Marley!
What's going on?
There's been an uproar.
Can I assume that you have taken me in your ranks?
Only if you point to other saboteurs.
Until then, you will be chained to Marley's girl.
If you turn into a Titan, you will tear her to pieces.
Don't worry.
She will soon understand us too.
That miniature girl is Marley's soldier.
They say she came to us.
Hello!
Hey!
Where's Falko now?
He's here too.
But he drank the brain juice from Zika.
How?
I don't know.
They say he got wine in his mouth where it was mixed.
Really?
Because of me!
Again!
I see.
With the help of this liquid, you repaired your army.
Do you know where Zika got this unusual ability from?
No idea.
Do you know?
No.
No one knew.
Except for Zika.
From the moment we met,
it seemed to me that Zika was constantly lying.
Four years ago, it changed to confidence.
When he met you,
he spoke sincerely for the first time.
Please believe me.
I understand what you went through, Aaron.
One day I will definitely save you.
Maybe he told you the secret of his special ability.
For example,
if this secret is related to the way to apply the power of the titan to parents.
Oh, you shaved your beard.
Did she go to you like that?
Aaron, it's too dangerous to trust her.
Yes, and she doesn't trust us either.
By the way,
can't you apply the power of the titan yet?
Where is Zika?
You'll find out soon.
Show me where the enemies are.
Over there!
Zika!
Zika!
Zika!
Zika!
Zika!
Zika!
Zika!
Zika!
Zika!
Zika!
Zika!
Zika!
Zika!
What is it?
It started.
The titans have come to the move.
Goliath!
It won't be easy after all.
Pika!
You're not a traitor!
Gabi, did you really think I'd sell my friends?
But you said we wouldn't have a future even if we served Marley.
Look.
I don't believe in Marley,
but I believe in my comrades who fought shoulder to shoulder.
There's a smoke signal.
Pika and Goliath have pulled him out of the shelter.
This titan is a progenitor.
We'll avenge Liberia.
It's time to finish him off.
Come on.
Reiner.
