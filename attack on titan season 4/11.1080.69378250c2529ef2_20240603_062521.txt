Gabby! Hey, what's wrong with you? Hey, hold on!
What's the matter? What happened?
She suddenly started attacking!
Hey, girl, what's wrong with you?
Gabby, that's too much!
Well, what's the point of running?
We would have been killed!
But the guard was trying to help you!
That's how I believed in this devil!
You can't even believe in Zeke!
You can't believe anyone at all!
Did you have a nightmare?
It would have been a dream.
I heard Gabby and Falko's voices.
Where are they?
Now!
THE END
THE END
THE END
THE END
Cheaters!
We've come a long way.
After all, we've been running all night.
Hey, take off your bandage.
She's throwing herself in the eye.
Even if she sees it,
ordinary residents won't understand what it is.
And the military will immediately guess.
Take it off already!
How can the military get caught in such a mess?
If you wear it, they will definitely catch you!
We still don't know how to get to Marley!
We have no way back.
Just before they catch me and kill me,
I want to find and ask Zeke.
We really betrayed Marley.
Why did he do that?
And you do what you want.
You can't come with me.
Yes, I understand.
Then I'll do what I want.
I'll take your bandage and throw it away.
Give it back!
And why?
What's the point?
What's the use of it here?
I'm a good-natured
shrew!
I'm no different from these strange demons without it!
What are you talking about?
Are you crazy?
Get off me!
Why did you
cling to me?
Why do you have to die?
What are you doing?
And in such a wound.
Where did the two of you come from?
I don't want to talk.
We had a bad time at home.
That's why we finally ran away.
So back.
We won't come back.
I see.
You probably want to eat.
Come with me.
I live nearby.
Wait here a little bit.
Okay.
These horses will be useful for escape.
What are you talking about?
We need to run even further.
They'll start looking for us here soon.
Besides,
I can't eat with demons.
You know.
Everything is ready.
Come in.
Yes, okay.
We're coming.
Come on.
Come on.
Okay, we're coming.
I'll talk.
Don't interfere with your nonsense.
So you guys
ran away from home.
What happened?
I'm glad to meet you.
My brother and sister.
Ben and Mia.
Something happened
and we ran away from our parents.
We will do any work we can.
Just let us
stay with you for a few days.
Just a few days.
Please.
Come on.
Children shouldn't bow.
Welcome to the horse farm Blouse.
Stay as long as you want.
And now
let's eat breakfast.
You must be tired.
When you eat,
go to bed.
Lisa, it's...
I'm sorry.
You had a hard time.
No.
I'm sorry, my sister.
Thank you for the treat.
It's delicious.
It's really delicious.
Lisa, it's...
Come on.
Mia, eat too.
Take my congratulations
on the success
of the recent expedition
in Marley.
The leaders of Hedzor
admire the courage
of the Eldians.
Your praise is an honor for us.
Welcome to the most dangerous
island in the world.
Yes.
Today we just arrived
to see this danger
with our own eyes.
So that's where
the reconnaissance device came from.
Yes.
This is the first
flying boat in the world
created only thanks to
the ice-flaming stones.
We want to assess the power
of the God of the Earth.
There are rumors
that Jäger is in prison,
and all volunteers are arrested.
Is that true?
Hey, Hanjo, explain
what you're talking about.
This is a military mission
of the Reavs company.
Ask the guards.
Hanjo, the victory of Jäger
has opened the way for us to the future.
Now the Eldians have a chance
to survive.
If that's the case,
then the relationship of Jäger and the military
is a matter of every Eldian resident.
Hanjo, you said
that you would share
information with the taxpayers.
This is a completely different situation.
The walls have opened,
and we have joined the world.
Information now makes a different sense.
I understand you're in a difficult situation, Hanjo.
Look me in the eye
and tell me that you can be trusted.
All this is for the sake of the Eldians,
for the sake of common good.
So you're the one who
shared information about Eren.
Kolger, Wim,
Luisa,
Novobranza together with them,
Flock.
And why did you do that?
Because Eren
should be released.
He didn't do anything wrong.
He rose up
against the almighty enemy
and returned victorious.
This victory
gave an incredible power
to Gull of the Earth
and provided the right to life.
Eren saved all of us,
citizens of the new Eldian Empire.
We have no guarantee
that Gull of the Earth
will work as expected
and save all of us.
To be honest,
it's just someone else's guesswork.
Only because Eren is still in prison.
Can we really
let you waste your time like this?
Our great future victory
will end with nothing.
The leader of our nation
has to be Eren Yeager.
Release him now!
Yes.
Maybe you're right.
In any case,
my decision helped
to bring the plan D to fruition.
All responsibility is on me.
Therefore, I will not allow
any more of my will.
You will be sentenced
for the disclosure of information about Eren
to the prison of all four.
With pleasure,
if it's the good of humanity behind the walls.
It seems the turn has come
to turn us into this role.
If we leave,
others will immediately take
our role.
Good luck to you,
Hange.
There is no power left.
No.
We still need to study something.
Mikasa,
did you sit in this room?
Huh?
No, not in this one.
I see.
What a pity.
But I don't regret
that I broke the rule.
If the goal of the scouts is victory,
then it is not necessary to always
adhere to the rules, right?
Stop it, Luisa.
You will only extend your term.
Since the day
you saved my life,
my beliefs have not changed.
When you
with one human force
threw the titan to the ground,
I realized that if you have no power,
then you can't protect anything.
I realized that we can fight
unfair violence.
Since that day,
I wanted to get a little closer to you,
so...
Mikasa,
why did you go to the scouts?
What is it?
If for the sake of the Jäger, then release me.
I can only say one thing.
Keep your mouth shut.
Mikasa,
everything is fine.
Mikasa.
Ten months ago,
at the banquet in Trost,
in honor of the opening of the railway,
your companion was suddenly replaced
by
Flok Faust.
Around the time of the party,
he accompanied you
to the place of the nightclub nearby.
And now he is arrested
on charges of disclosure of secrets.
In addition,
your nightclub was located
a few dozen kilometers from the place
of the residence of Erron Jäger.
Apparently,
it was from that time that Erron
switched to his free activities.
Anyway,
I'm always glad to offer
to talk to the beauty.
Erron.
Gabi!
Gabi!
Gabi!
Why did you do this to me?
Is this a demon's trick?
No.
I think it's a horse's trick.
I don't think even one horse
will let you jump on it.
We were not taught
how to ride a horse.
And it turns out that sitting
in this blind man,
nothing will come out.
I think it's better not to do anything stupid,
but to stay here.
What are you talking about?
Sooner or later,
troops from all over the world will attack the island.
I think my brother, Reiner,
and the rest will come to save us.
Are you not angry with Zika?
After all, the traitor was right next to us.
Well,
we can't do anything anyway.
Why am I Mia?
And why am I younger?
What's the difference?
Guys,
let's have lunch.
You learn fast
at work.
What?
Thank you for the compliment.
By the way, I noticed
that not only you, but the rest of the workers
are very young here.
Yes, because all the orphans are here.
Here it is.
The Queen ordered
to help children who have nowhere to go.
Here gathered
those who lost their parents four years ago.
It looks like you didn't recognize
your crimes.
Have you really forgotten
your story?
About what evil the people of this island
committed against the world.
Only then, when every Eldian
realizes his crimes,
the path to redemption will finally open.
This is somehow connected
to the fact that we lost our parents.
Of course.
No matter how righteous you are,
your crimes will not be hidden.
This is what Marley teaches you.
This is the basis of history.
You again!
What did you just say?
You came from Marley, right?
Where are you from?
What do you mean, where are you from?
You shouted about it yourself.
What?
So you knew from the very beginning?
Yes?
Right from the very beginning?
What a shame!
What did you just say?
As if you were making fun of me.
What are you doing?
She's a demon!
She showed her true nature!
I thought that the island demon
couldn't be so kind!
Hey, are you crazy?
Hey!
What's going on there?
It's his brother!
He's afraid that I'll take him away!
Come on!
Kai became friends with them
and became a little more fun.
Don't play with Will!
It's dangerous!
Okay!
Why?
This is the village
where I used to live.
Four years ago,
when the tyrant took him away,
all the residents ran away
and threw my mom
with her sick legs.
I couldn't do anything
and just sat
here
and listened to
my mom eating.
She was
alive all this time.
At one point, she stopped screaming.
Probably because
she lost her voice.
They say
there are people behind the walls
who consider us
real demons.
But I don't understand
why they hate us so much.
Mia, Ben,
explain to me
what my mom did.
What did she deserve
such hatred for?
Because the Eldians
have been killing people
all over the world for thousands of years!
The Eldians have been killing people
all over the world for thousands of years!
With the help of the power of the giants,
they ruled the world and destroyed it!
They took the culture from other peoples,
forced them to give birth to unwanted children,
killed countless people!
Stop depicting the victim!
But my mom was born
and raised in these places.
I don't think she's involved
in this horror.
The problem is
what terrible crimes
she committed a hundred years ago!
A hundred years ago?
So what are we guilty of?
Who lives now and not then?
Because very recently
you destroyed my city.
My mom was killed
four years ago
and she's not guilty of that.
I told you!
The ancestors were killing people all over the world!
My mom didn't kill anyone!
Hey, Mia!
Explain to me
what the reason is!
Otherwise, it's nonsense!
Why did my mom get eaten alive?
Tell me!
What did they kill her for?
Tell me!
But why?
It was intelligence warfare.
The purpose of the invasion of Paradis
four years ago
was intelligence warfare
to prepare a large-scale attack.
Your mom
became an accidental victim.
She wasn't guilty of anything!
I'm sorry.
He gave the enemy secret information
and even apologizes.
Thank you, Ben,
for telling me everything.
Well, you don't have to apologize.
You were just born
in Marley.
So,
Kaya, tell me,
how did you save yourself?
I was saved by a girl
who was a little older than me now.
She broke into the house with an axe
and threw herself at the titan.
But this is madness!
Yes.
As a result, she locked me with her
and gave me the opportunity to run.
If she were alive,
she would never have left
lost children like you.
She never left me.
Recently,
we were invited to a restaurant
where Marley works.
If we take you with us,
you will probably find a way
to go home.
Why?
Because I want to become
like her.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
We examined the remains of animal husbandry
and found parts of Zika's body that exploded as a result of the explosion.
But there were too few of them.
We managed to find only a part of both of their arms and legs.
He obviously set up his death to deceive all of us.
We believe that Zika united with the enemy forces
and fled with them on the route.
This drive is modified for war against people
with the use of Marley technologies.
And the pilot, who was being hijacked for a flight,
proved to be highly skilled,
only trained for military.
Most likely, four years ago,
Zika was sending unites on a reconnaissance ship
and, in other words, L.D. restorers.
Damn! We fought shoulder to shoulder.
I didn't think he was a traitor.
Of course, we're not going to leave it like that.
Within half a year,
the World War Coalition will begin an operation to clean up Paradis.
In half a year?
We'll be saving Falka and Cappie in half a year too!
These two are the most capable candidates in the war.
Their loss will be a heavy blow to the Marley army.
And it will take a lot of time to train new candidates.
However, if Marley attacks Paradis with its own forces,
it will only cause even more losses than before.
We are waiting for the coalition to gather its forces.
I'm sure Zika thinks the same.
After such a crushing defeat,
the Marley army will soon move on to the offensive.
He is not one of those who will sit with folded hands
and wait until he is crushed in half a year.
You can't wait for the World Coalition!
You need to set up Paradis right now!
To be continued...
Who should you hate?
What should you regret?
Those who believed should have been used to doubt.
Next, those who point the way.
