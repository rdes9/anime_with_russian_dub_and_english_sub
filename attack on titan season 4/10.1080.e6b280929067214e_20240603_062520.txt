What are you doing?
I was talking to my reflection in the mirror.
I said,
Boris, Boris.
Yes?
Hey.
You said,
Boris, Boris.
Boris, Boris.
Well, what to fight with?
Boris, Boris.
I repeated two times.
So the fight is over?
Yes.
Well, what to fight with?
Boris, Boris.
I repeated twice.
So there will be two fights?
I don't understand if you keep quiet.
I think usually no one will talk to themselves.
For example, I never wanted to talk to my reflection.
In my opinion, your hairstyle looks cool.
Your hair is a little braided.
It is transmitted an attempt to give yourself a look of busy negligence.
Why did you come?
What for?
To talk to you.
Do you remember?
After the first meeting, we talked all night about giants.
But more precisely, you only listened.
My endless monologue.
I had no doubt that you will never sacrifice history.
This is my last word.
I will destroy all the nations.
I am the one.
I am the one.
A fair reason.
Two years ago.
Aaron.
We haven't seen each other for a year.
Since you took up our ship.
Will we be happy to work with you together?
No.
And he will not interact with you in advance.
We will allow him to see his face as much as possible.
That's quite enough.
Today will be a joyful day.
Because the port is finished.
And for the first time, dear foreign guests will come.
From the only friendly paradise of the state.
Hitsuro.
Special ambassador.
Kiyomi Atsumabito.
Do you know this family name?
This is ...
Show me, Mikasa.
But ...
Mom told me to keep it a secret.
But in childhood.
You showed me.
The secret could be kept for such a day.
Well.
I inherited this mark from my late mother's family.
She told me to put it on my children.
What a noble deed.
About a hundred years ago, the son of Shogun Hitsuro,
the head of the Atsumabito family,
was a close friend of the King Fritz family
and visited Paradise Island.
And after the war of the giants,
when Hitsuro, as the defeated party,
lost his position in the midst of all the incredible chaos,
the child of the family of Shogun remained on the island.
Alas, the descendant of the deceased ruler of our country,
Nadezhda Hitsuro.
I still don't get it.
What's so strange?
The main thing is to use Hitsuro.
What if it's a trap?
After all, we'll have to find out Elena's opinion.
No!
They only achieve this!
One thing is known for sure.
We are no more than children
who have taken the first unconfident steps
along the united seas of the world.
We will be silent and only listen carefully.
Hey, why did you show this mark only to Elena?
Because no one else even saw your bandage on your hand.
Well, you know ...
What a joy.
Of course I'm glad.
We both have a hard time because of who we were born.
For me, there is no one more reliable than Mikasa.
Today is a historical day for both our countries,
and he would never have come if it weren't for the man
who brought us together, Zik Jäger.
We secretly met with him,
and in exchange for the promise to bring us together with Mrs. Mikasa,
we agreed on certain conditions.
Let me tell you.
What is it?
I want to tell you.
First, look here.
Where from?
You know.
After all, Marley is a secret.
This is a maneuverable drive,
developed on Paradis, a device for the killing of the titans.
Don't worry, I got this one myself.
I will present it to you as a gift.
However, for the operation of this device,
special fuel is needed.
They call it ice-flaming stones.
This is a mysterious excavation,
which has been discovered only on Paradis.
Surely, there are still traces of it in this device.
Zik Jäger, in exchange for help in fulfilling his plan,
offered help in creating an industrial power
that will return the former greatness to the poor country.
However, we have not even appreciated the treasure yet.
However, if he told the truth,
then for our era of modernization,
these resources are comparable to innumerable wealth.
It turns out that I was just a pretext.
Elena said that negotiations will go easily
because Azumabit has a sharp sense of money.
Still, they would not risk traveling to the island
if the matter did not cause profit.
So, Zik Jäger has set conditions.
What are they?
As you know,
Zik Jäger claims that he has a secret plan
for his execution necessary to interfere with Hidzor.
Here are three stages that are necessary
for Gul of the Earth to be able to protect the island.
The first is to demonstrate the use of Gul of the Earth.
Demonstrate part of its power
so that the whole world can see your destructive power.
The second is to interfere with Hidzor.
Our goal is to raise your military power to the middle of the world
so that you do not have to completely rely on Gul of the Earth.
In addition, all this time you need to constantly have
the titan of the forefathers and the titan of the royal blood.
This is the third stage.
Zik will pass the titan of the beast,
and the royal blood will flow into the tombs.
And this man, who has spent 13 years of his life,
should leave as many children as possible.
Whatever other weapon they invent,
Gul of the Earth will remain a terrible threat.
If we can't get rid of him,
the giants will have to pass from generation to generation.
Is it worth leaving our descendants
in such a dead end?
Of course not, but still.
Okay, I agree to inherit the titan of the beast.
Gul of the Earth is necessary for our survival.
History.
The walls were destroyed, and we were trampled.
And now we will finally be allowed to live
if we, as a squad, give birth and kill children.
I will never support the plan of Zika Eger!
It is dangerous to trust our fate to preserve the threat of Gul of the Earth.
Will it be better for us for the rest of time
to consider all possible options?
It seemed to me that you and I were one in impatience.
But I don't understand why you started acting alone
and put our island in such danger.
Does history really not worry you anymore?
I have eaten the titan of the hammerman.
His ability to control the Earth from the ground
with solidification, to create weapons or whatever.
That is, it is useless for me to keep
even in the deepest and strongest dungeon.
I can get out whenever I want.
Of course, you can't kill the titan owner about his parents.
And you can't kill Zika either, no matter how much you threaten.
What am I leaning towards?
Hanji, what can you do?
Tell me, Hanji!
If you know another way, then tell me now!
Eren, you're a pervert!
Did a teenage rebel wake up in you?
You're a fool!
Erwin, that was your only mistake.
Why did you make me the head of the scouts?
Let's go to the house, Historia.
You need to take care of your health.
After all, it was necessary to follow our ideas,
turn the Queen Historia into a titan
and feed her with Zika Yeager.
It was worth it to step on the island.
But instead of that, it was worth it.
They left her to have fun and even make children.
After all, the ink remains ink.
The Queen has only one name in it.
Hey!
Stop it.
The Queen has the right to choose a cavalryman.
We checked that he is not someone's pawn.
The native is from the same place as she is.
They say that in childhood he threw stones at the Queen.
I wanted her to notice.
Probably in the shelter he helped because of the feeling of guilt.
For many years, without raising his head, he did black work
and the Queen herself paid attention to him.
I don't care how their romance ended.
The question is why exactly now the Queen did so voluntarily.
Someone must have tired her that if she gets pregnant,
they will not turn her into a titan.
100% it was Elena.
She is the most cunning and cunning of them all.
Don't expect anything from her.
She made the Queen get pregnant and thus saved Zika's life.
Hey, you drank too much, Locke.
Now we can still turn her into a pregnant titan.
Then the child will die.
And if something happens to her, it's over.
Pregnancy is such a threat to the Queen's life.
Such just arguments ruin the country.
Hey, bring another bottle of Marlitz.
Just a minute.
Gris.
Nikola.
Do you recommend this?
Do we really have to do this kind of work?
No, we don't have to.
If this idiot didn't open his mouth
and didn't say that he was going to train his muscles
and help with the development of the island.
Well, now it remains only to wait for answers from Hizuru.
Yes, Hizuru can help us start a dialogue with the world.
If it is possible to get around without the gul of the earth
and save history from suffering,
why not grab Solomon?
Hey!
Oh, I'm sorry that we have to work in such heat.
Well, we still have to watch this idiot.
Look how big they are.
Are you talking about Hizuru?
I just got an answer from Adzumabit.
What did you say?
Nothing good.
Hizuru also wants to keep a distance.
After all, they intend to monopolize the resources of Paradis
and help trade with other countries.
In addition, the world needs Paradis to remain a source of threat.
This stimulates the conclusion of the Union
and ensures world stability.
So it remains only to lay on the gul of the earth
and not to escape the victim of bringing history.
Exactly.
How come?
They didn't even take into account our intentions
and appointed us to play the role of the devils.
Why is no one trying to find a way to the common world?
Because they don't understand anything.
They don't know who we really are,
and that's why they're afraid.
Exactly.
Who will trust someone you've never seen?
So let's meet them.
If someone doesn't understand us,
we'll explain everything to them.
That's how scouts do it.
Establish a base in Marley and get through it?
So that's the plan Hanzhi came up with.
There we can go to the real Marley kitchen.
What would I take?
I wouldn't want to get stomach upset.
Medicines for the stomach, toothbrush,
and something with the taste of Motherland.
Have you ever listened to Hanzhi?
If the world knows that we don't want war,
maybe something will change.
If only we had time.
I have a little over five years left.
It's time to make a decision.
Who should I give my titan to?
I'll take him.
No, you can't.
We don't know what kind of a man you are, Ackerman.
Besides, Hizuru has the same plans for you.
Why become a titan?
There are too many reasons why you can't.
Then who, instead of me?
Here I am.
First of all, I'm a lot smarter than Aaron.
Not some half-brained self-killer,
but a rare genius who can always and in any situation
make the best decisions.
That's me.
I don't want to be given to you, of course,
but is there a candidate better than me?
What's the point of leaving such a wonderful man
to some 13-year-old?
Are you a fool?
What?
Become my boss or something.
I inherit the titan Aaron.
Yeah?
You don't mind, do you, Aaron?
C'mon.
That won't do.
You're a fool, aren't you?
Huh?
You're not an Ackerman.
How can you trust such an important role of a fool?
Huh?
There you go.
I inherit the titan.
Only we gained enough combat experience
and earned the trust.
And by the method of exclusion, I'm the only one.
Guys...
But I don't feel like it.
I don't feel like it.
Huh?
No.
It's just nonsense.
Huh?
Well...
You said you couldn't leave the titan to a fool.
Huh?
You're even more stupid than me.
So you're contradicting yourself.
Huh?
Huh?
I'm not going to make you someone's heir.
Why not?
Because I value you more than anyone else.
That's why...
I wish you a long life.
Hey!
Hey, you!
Why are you so angry?
Look at the mood you've created!
I'm sorry.
Jam, it's about the sunset.
Because of it, we all seem to be red.
I see.
Well, you can't escape the sunset.
Are the volunteers arrested?
I didn't expect Commander Pixis to take such tough measures.
The scouts have close ties with them.
That's why they didn't tell us in advance.
Yeah.
They didn't have a new choice.
The Zika plan is not known yet.
We're in a very dangerous situation.
And Aaron suddenly supported the Zika plan.
What were they talking about when they met?
It's probably just them.
Tell me.
Wasn't he like our Aaron?
I don't think so.
It's not Aaron.
What if he stands up for his cousin, not ours?
If so, then what?
Then we should be ready to fight him.
I won't let that happen.
Are you really going to stand up for them, Mikasa?
I don't think it's going to happen.
Aaron is most important to us.
You have to understand that.
That's probably why he became so aggressive towards everyone else.
His feelings are just too strong.
You're wrong.
No matter how strong you are.
He always tried to keep you away from the front line.
But he made the army destroy the port and sent you into battle.
And the rest, who was dear to him, me, Kona, Sasha.
It's because he trusts us.
If we hadn't gone, he wouldn't have been able to do anything.
Sasha wouldn't have died then.
Mikasa.
How did Aaron react to Sasha's death?
Did he cry?
Or was he angry?
Kona, don't.
He laughed.
So what's so funny?
He found Sasha's death.
Explain to me, Mikasa, why Aaron laughed.
You know everything about him.
Yes.
Let's talk to Aaron.
The three of us.
I, Mikasa, and he.
Let's see what he really wants.
Talk, and what?
What if Aaron divides with Elzik?
We have a drug to turn into a titan.
So it's a choice.
Really?
The choice is to turn into a titan someone else you can trust.
Or to take him to Aaron's parents.
If you want to fly high, tell him.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Gabbi and Falco can't escape the cell.
They don't know where to go, and the an forces their way to the devil they hate.
Next – the cheaters.
