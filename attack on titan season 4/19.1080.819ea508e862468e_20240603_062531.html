Goliath!
He's stopped!
Nice!
And another beast attack!
Don't let them shoot!
Look at those bums!
There's a transport there!
We need to get rid of her first!
Armin!
The bums are going after the enemies!
Back off! We can't break through here!
Let's get rid of the Marley soldiers first!
Yeah!
Back off!
Let's go!
Attack the enemy from the rear!
Commander is right.
Now is not the time to fight the Marley.
Let's go to the enemy from the rear.
Let's go!
I fell...
to the ground.
They shot me.
So...
Eren...
Wake up, Borka!
Find your strength!
Goliath!
I'm sorry, Reiner, I'm sorry.
In fact, you shouldn't have been chosen as a warrior.
I overestimated you,
but my brother underestimated me
and influenced the decision of the military.
I...
wanted to protect my brother.
Marley!
Marshal Magat!
It was Zik who called me.
Now...
I will summon...
the Titans.
Wait!
Wait!
Falco!
Falco!
Falco!
Falco!
Falco!
I got your mouth, back and brain fluid!
Please don't shout!
Zik!
What is he talking about?
You know,
I earned the right to hunt the beast
so that my family would not be sent to hell.
Brother, let go!
To be honest, even before your betrayal,
I didn't understand what was on your mind.
In general,
but...
even you wouldn't blink your eyes
and sacrifice your children!
I don't ask you to be silent and wait for death!
Just wait until Falco is in the middle of a scream!
And then kill as many as you can!
Even the Marley people, even the Indians, whoever you want!
Just...
spare my brother!
Falco!
Get in quickly!
Don't come closer, Gabi!
Colt!
I perfectly understand your concern for your brother.
Zik...
That's why...
I'm sorry.
Let go!
Let me go, brother!
I'm right next to you!
What is it?
The enemies...
turned into the Titans!
Ray, grab the anti-tank rifle!
Listen!
Listen up!
Don't come near!
Don't come.
Falco!
I can't do it with the two of them, and they're going to break out.
Is it really necessary to finish off Falco?
I'll have to.
Eren!
Falco!
My head!
This Taras is ready.
I'm sure of it.
The main threat is the two of them.
Damn it!
Someone!
Is everyone dead?
The only thing that's left is the progenitor.
We don't need your head.
Enough of your brain sensitivity!
We're a little bit late.
Shoot him!
It's over!
You're finished!
You're finished!
It's over!
You're finished!
It's all over.
Aron can no longer use the power of the progenitor.
We have done our duty.
The rest...
can be given to others.
I just need to make a statement...
and that's it.
We need the armored one.
Falco!
I have no more power to heal the wounds.
Yes.
I just won't die.
I saw Marcel's memories.
He deceived the military...
and made you a soldier, bastard.
To protect me...
Wait!
Eren!
Wait!
Don't!
Falco!
Now you know for sure...
that I was the best...
until the very end.
Goliath?
Not really.
Well done, Eren.
I just repeated the peak...
but the idea of the dead priest worked.
Just a little bit more.
Come to me, Eren!
To begin with, Eren...
thank you for asking me to come here.
Elena has already told you my idea.
Do you support...
the plan of a merciful death?
I don't.
I don't.
I don't.
I don't.
I don't.
Do you support...
the plan of a merciful death?
Four years ago...
one incident...
reminded me of my father.
The day when he killed the king's family...
behind the walls.
He smeared them like bugs...
and even small children.
Their feelings were preserved on the skin.
If they were still alive...
their parents would have returned...
to the king's family...
and he would have been bound by the oath of peace.
And this would have led us...
to death behind the walls.
The death of children...
gave us life.
I see.
Father was right.
Is that what you thought?
No.
Father was wrong.
Besides...
I was also his mistake...
If the Eldians hadn't been born...
the residents of this city...
wouldn't have had to become...
the victims of our future plan.
Not to be born in this world...
is the greatest salvation.
I will do what is necessary.
I will put an end...
to the two-thousand-year-old power of the Titans.
And until that day comes,
we must move forward.
Isn't that right, brother?
Yes.
Yes.
That's right.
I would like to shake your hand...
but...
we'd better not touch each other now.
Here's a replacement.
Take this ball.
Eren.
We will definitely bring...
salvation to everyone.
He didn't catch it.
He lost his form...
from life in the hospital.
To be continued...
To be continued...
Where am I?
This is the coordinate...
where all the paths intersect.
I think.
Most likely...
all the royal heirs...
of my parents...
came here...
when they decided...
to use his power.
Brother...
I've been waiting for you.
Eren...
I've been waiting for you.
Eren...
It seems you haven't recovered...
and you haven't woken up.
I've been sitting here for many years.
Many years?
So much time has passed.
I don't quite understand myself.
But everything here...
happens in an instant.
Gaby shot your head off.
But you touched me before...
I finally let go of my spirit.
We did it.
We did it.
We did it.
You and I have obtained...
the power of the progenitor.
There's someone here.
Don't worry.
It's...
the progenitor Emyr.
Are you talking about the progenitor Emyr?
How do you know?
Who else...
can wander in such a place?
Moreover, the progenitor...
restored half of my body...
from this sand...
and brought me back to life.
She must be...
creating titans here.
Every time...
when we try our best...
she spends...
unlimited time.
Was she always...
alone here?
Eren...
tell the progenitor Emyr...
It's time to fulfill...
our dream.
What's this chain?
You just noticed...
that I'm chained.
But...
thank you for your concern.
They leave me free...
with the other words...
of the world's curse.
After all...
you're the only one...
who can act freely here.
Only you...
can give the order...
to the progenitor Emyr.
This is my journey...
to the north of the dream.
And yours too.
Please...
save the world.
Eren...
Tell the progenitor...
that none of the Eldians...
will ever be able...
to have a child.
You can destroy the Earth...
with the help of the coalition...
later.
Give every Eldian...
mercy of death.
Eren...
I'm not going to follow...
such a crazy plan.
I'm sorry, brother.
I was just giving you...
everything to be here.
As long as the Eldians exist...
this hell will not end.
If you don't do what you need...
the war will not continue.
What we repeated...
again.
Why?
Eren!
Answer me!
Because I was born in this world.
Progenitor Emyr.
Give me your strength.
I was so afraid, Eren.
But I wanted to believe...
that you would understand me.
Did your father...
lose his mind so much?
What...
does that mean?
You've been sleeping...
for a long time.
I've learned a lot.
The progenitor can create...
anything.
Even these clay chains.
If that's the case,
the queen's blood will surely flow.
Unlike the generation of kings...
behind the walls,
I came here...
without the ideologies of the first king.
And also...
I spent a very long time...
with the progenitor.
And I was able to...
The progenitor Emyr...
has unlimited power.
But her true essence...
is her own will.
The queen's blood...
will surely flow.
She considers herself her master...
and will do everything for her.
The power of the progenitor...
is mine.
It can't be.
You were just a key...
Eren.
It's good...
that I waited and heard...
your true thoughts.
It's not your fault.
We are the children...
of the worst father in the world.
An unfortunate victim.
But...
I found another father...
who saved me.
And you also needed...
someone to save you.
I will never leave you.
I will correct you...
with the power of the progenitor.
Stop it, it's useless.
And when I save Emyr...
we will be together!
To be continued...
The End
The End
