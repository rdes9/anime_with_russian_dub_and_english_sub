        <pre>Dad, where are you going? Will you bring the presents?
I'm with you. I want it too.
Can I? Please.
Dad, I want to be with you.
I'm sorry.
This time you can't be with me.
Why?
It's not fair.
Hey, guys, enough whining.
Dad needs to work.
Dad needs to work.
Dad needs to work.
Dad needs to work.
Dad needs to work.
You need to work.
Finna, try to live together.
Good luck at work.
Yeah.
Okay, I need to go.
Bye.
Bye, Dad.
I'm sorry.
Take care of the kids.
Let's go.
So, the attack was carried out right during the speech?
I can't say for sure.
But it's the most likely outcome.
The entire top of the Marley army will gather,
and even in full force.
Moreover, for the sake of safety,
the route of their transportation,
we will inform only at the last moment.
The important guests and their crews in general.
Then we'll put the military from the edge of the stage,
and it is desirable to put them closer together.
Are you sure of your decision?
The current Tiber did not sit down,
folding their hands,
unlike the previous generations.
All this time we have established relations
with the higher layers of society,
worked on the reputation of the Eldians,
and watched over the Paradise Island.
But we did not look after our country.
We did not notice how the enemy crossed the ocean
and grabbed us by the throat.
And now, at any moment,
the rift can begin.
But most dangerously,
the secret accomplice of the Paradise Island.
We have not been able to reveal it.
After all, as you know,
the enemies have died more than enough.
And among the military they are also.
If we want to smoke them out,
we will have to take a risk.
We will allow the enemy's plan to be implemented,
but we use it in our own interests.
If you have no other ideas,
then we act according to the plan.
Are we sacrificing too many people
for the sake of the attention of the military?
I don't feel sorry for our shameless officers.
If the enemy wants to destroy the Marley army,
I will even help him.
When the army is reorganized,
you will personally select a new officer.
But people will die.
Most of them are Eldians!
Devilish scum!
You are late, Mr. Magat.
You yourself threw the Eldians on the battlefield.
How many of them died from the explosion of the mine or the bullet?
Whether it is military or not,
all lives are equal.
Just do the same as always.
Let me remind you.
We are not at war now.
We don't know the enemy in person
and we don't know how he plans to attack.
There will be a crowd of innocent people on the square.
War Tiber.
It is highly likely that I will not be able to protect you.
Because of this plan, you will die.
You are too important for bait.
I understand.
And I am ready to die.
If I don't speak personally,
the world will not pay attention to us.
Military, ambassadors, journalists.
Without me, they will not get together.
And most importantly,
together with me, the Eldians from Liberia should die
so that we can be pitied.
Poor victims of a sudden attack.
If I manage to escape,
the support of the world community can be forgotten.
The Eldians are undoubtedly devilish scum.
But we, the Marlites,
are mere devils.

Giant hammer.
Sofya.
Sofya, are you okay?
Sofya!
Sofya!
Sofya!
Sofya!
Sofya!
Sofya!
Sofya!
Sofya, are you alive?
Sofya!
Hurry up! We need to get up!
I will!
Hurry up!
My brother,
you did great!
Thanks to you, Tiber.
GO!
Major Magat! The Giant Hammer is down!
The soldiers still aren't here!
They've sealed the Marshal Calvy and men down in the这么!
You could get the marks yourself!
Here's the mission order!
Major!
But it was he who started Marlin's counter-attack.
I did not expect such a grandiose appearance.
This must be his whole essence.
The one who acquired the power of the Founder, the attacking giant,
Eren Yager, his own persona.
Now you won't have to go to the island.
Everyone, get ready for the attack!
Yes, sir!
Oh, that's what they went for.
You went too far. Run away from here!
Remember well that it was me who made the first shot.
Damn it, what the hell?
Has the war already begun?
Kolt, what's with Udoi?
He doesn't have much time. He needs to go to the hospital.
Udoi, live!
Bastard!
Bastard!
Falco! Where are you?
So what? What's going on there?
Judging by the rumble, the giants are fighting upstairs.
It can't be!
Well, otherwise, why else would we be thrown into the pit?
We need to get out of here.
But how?
What is this?
How long are you?
The peak!
Are you all right there?
Hurry up, get the rope here!
It's coming!
Tankers? How did they find out?
I didn't like that beard, so I took measures.
So here it is.
This guy is strange. Follow us.
During the speech, the giant appeared.
What?
Now the giant is young, giving him resistance.
Where is the transporter armor?
In our headquarters. We'll take it in 15 minutes.
Let's take it in 10 minutes.
Yes!
I'm going forward.
Wait, Porco. First, let's assess the situation.
What is this?
Are they really already here?
What have we got here?
We got you!
Get to work!
Giant warrior cannons are useless!
Please tell the commander!
Commander Magat, let's finish off Eren Yager and finish off the Founder and the rest of the enemies.
No.
If we kill the Founder, we will only put an end to the problem.
He must be eaten by the giant hammer.
And we must help him with that.
But Commander...
It doesn't look like the hammer is trying to eat the Founder.
The giant hammer is a mole!
Attackers have no chance!
The hammer has won!
There he is.
Eren Yager.
He's right. He will be finished.
Usurper, Eren Yager.
Do you have anything to say?
Come on, Mikasa.
Eren Yager
Eren Yager
Guys, you've come.
Eren, please.
Let's go home.
All command is destroyed.
It's time to test our army for strength.
Stop the special training in the mountains immediately.
Throw everyone here.
This is called the fleet.
I'm waiting for 30,000 soldiers from the east and west from you.
Take the Geta Liberio.
And don't miss the Founders and all these demons.
You can go as long as you want.
You have no future.
With this pointless hammer, you forced all countries of the world to unite against you.
As Willy Tybur planned.
Now the world has learned the seriousness of the threat of the Jewish Empire.
Now everyone will wish you only death.
However, they themselves must understand this.
What do they hope for?
Vile demons!
Kill them!
What's wrong with you?
Hey, you're going to burn the whole Geta.
The losses among the civilians should be minimal.
Do you understand me, Flock?
There are no innocent people here.
There are only enemies around.
Or have you already forgotten how many residents of the walls died because of them?
We were eaten alive.
This is just the beginning of the payment.
You can't do anything about it.
Look.
Aaron showed us what we need to fight for.
You can't sit behind the wall and wait for your fate.
We need this kind of devil.
Aaron, do you realize how terrible you have done?
You took life from the innocent.
You killed even children.
And this is not to be corrected.
Mikasa, we're not done yet.
It can't be.
I broke his back.
I broke his back too.
What?
I broke his back.
I broke his back too.
What?
But he's still alive.
Everything is clear.
Giant hammer.
With the help of solidification, he can create anything.
Now I understand.
No matter how much you hit him in the back, it's useless.
Mikasa, try to distract him.
If everything works out, I'll eat the hammer.
No way.
We're all dead, and the guy is already dead.
How?
At least look at him.
Look for yourself.
You're a candidate for the war.
Doctor, wait.
Yes, I'm coming.
Gabi, find your relatives.
It's not safe to go anywhere now.
But it's better to stay away from the square.
And I'll go look for Foryka.
I'll go too.
Why did Uda and Sofia die?
I don't understand.
Wait, Gabi, don't!
Hey, stop!
There's a battle going on!
Gabi!
What are you doing here?
Uncle guard!
Let me fight!
Don't be stupid, girl!
You'd better go home!
What's going on?
The enemy is attacking!
Where did the fire come from?
From above!
Bastard!
Run, Gabi!
Hurry!
Hey, are you hurt?
Uncle!
I blocked the way for him.
Let's go, Sasha.
Coney, didn't you forget to put the flashlight?
Oh, right.
Let's go.
Jean, we were delayed by reinforcements.
Have you installed the flashlights?
All in one.
How's it going?
So far, everything is as planned.
It remains to neutralize this creature.
But how to know?
Everything may go wrong.
What awaits us after this battle?
If we want to know, we must survive.
Now I understand what was wrong.
The appearance of the giant hammer itself was strange.
His body began to materialize with a knot.
Not from the back of the head, but from under the ground near the stage.
A real body of a hammer.
Not bad.
He's going to eat the hammer now.
How long have I been waiting for this?
Now the founder is ours!
Aaron!
What the...
I can't bite!
Did he do it?
Is it really Ackerman?
We must retreat!
What the hell?
I'm a giant!
And ordinary people are going to kill me?
So here you are!
Demons!
Paradise!
The twinkling of a second ago
The world that was left behind
If you want to fly, tell him
Hey!
The countless thorns that burn the wings
Scatter the ashes
There is no peace
The proof that I was here
The bones will melt the sand and disappear
The bones will melt the sand and disappear
I'm alive
