        <pre>This is a survival! Everyone, come here! Hurry up and help!
Be careful!
Don't be afraid. It's all good now.
The walls of the Titan have been built in the Shirengi and are going away from the island.
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do either.
I don't know what to do either.
I don't know what to do either.
The walls of the Titan have been built in the Shirengi and are going away from the island.
They were not going to attack us, but...
What was that?
What a terrible and strange dream.
My house.
Because of Eren Yeager.
My house.
What is it, a couple of other victims?
How dare you!
His son died!
Many others died under the walls of the Titan.
No, Eren killed them.
That's right.
Eren Yeager killed people from his country.
But if he hadn't awakened the walls of the Titan,
all the Eldians on the island would have been cut out by aliens.
Exactly!
Our Eldian Empire survived thanks to these grateful victims.
We won!
There is no victory without victims.
They all died for a reason.
We will give our hearts back!
We will give our hearts back!
We will give our hearts back!
Things are bad.
The civilians are on the platoon.
They will fight each other.
We need to prepare.
Bring everything with equipment for suppression and disorder.
Yes!
Damn it!
What have they done there in the living room?
There is a trace.
From the basement?
Will you scream?
I'll cut your throat.
First, I'll put on a mask.
I was thinking about me.
The old woman attacked me.
I didn't know that the day would come when I would fall to the ground on my own.
Lenny!
Why did I get caught?
Exactly!
Hitch!
We need to get her out of the basement.
Or I'll do it again.
Somebody!
It's useless.
I made a wound in advance.
I can turn into a titan whenever I want.
You have to do as I say.
And don't move.
We'll see.
You're so weak.
How do you have the strength to turn?
Maybe you're right.
Do you want to take a risk and check?

I'm coming in!

All the time I was in my consciousness.
These four years were like a foggy dream to me.
Only your growling and the voice of Armin were heard from afar.
The rest of the time was the same.
Invisible darkness.
So, according to your stories, I knew more or less what was going on in the world.
And then I was suddenly thrown out of the dream.
And I heard Saren's voice.
He was seriously saying that he wanted to destroy the world.
To destroy the world?
Titan walls. And they really came out.
Look under their feet.
My only meaningful job in soldier life is to clean up dead bodies and debris.
Just like after your fight with Saren.
Now you tell me,
what do you think when you see the bodies of those who were destroyed for the sake of your great goal?
Yes, you asked me that often.
That's why I thought about what didn't come to mind before.
For us, murder was a matter that was praised for.
We were taught that on the other side of the border you can kill all units, both military and civilian.
The confession of sins and sins and the mission to save the world justified any action.
Armin told me about your position.
Simply put, you wanted to prevent this?
Do you want to say that the corpses under the rubble are just a small sacrifice for you?
No, I didn't care about saving the world.
What?
I didn't care about anything at all.
I was thrown out by my parents soon after I was born.
I think it's because I was the daughter of a lover and a child.
And then I was picked up in the ghetto by a foreigner with Seldin blood.
He said that he was sent to the ghetto for a similar reason.
His goal was to raise a Marley warrior from me to make his life worthwhile.
Since I was a child, he had been killing the martial arts of his homeland in me.
For him, my life was worth only if I could become a warrior.
Years have passed.
I became as strong as he wanted me to be.
And I returned him the pain that had caused me all this time.
Since then, he couldn't walk without crutches.
But he was glad.
He said that now I could kill enemies even without weapons.
What? What? What is this monologue for?
I've been silently listening to your stories for four years.
Would you please listen to me a little?
So I didn't care about anything.
No matter who died in which country or stayed alive,
I didn't see the value of anyone's life, including my own.
Until that moment.
In the morning before the event on the island, he fell on his knees and apologized.
He said that everything he taught me was wrong.
And then he begged me in tears that I should return home.
He was a warrior.
He was an honorable Marley.
That all this didn't matter, only if I came back alive.
He was my father.
And he considered me his own son.
He considered me his own daughter.
I have a father who is waiting for my return.
And other people have the same.
There are those who are dear to them.
I can no longer say that I don't care about anything.
And I understand that I committed irreparable crimes.
But if you help me return to my father, I will do it all over again.
I understand. Thank you for what you said.
But even if you return to your father, you will see only corpses and ruins.
Probably.
Please believe me, it's true.
Did you also see that dream of his?
Here comes the day when the strange devils came to our souls.
What are you talking about?
They have Gabi, Falco.
It's not a simple dream.
How much longer can you repeat?
The hunt in the ground has begun.
Eren and J채ger are going to kill everyone and everyone.
And your house and the house of your wife are also compared to the ground.
And I say, we have no reason to believe you.
Have you all seen the same dream?
Why should we believe such nonsense?
Maybe they just agreed to run away from here.
The Indians all over the world are probably saying the same thing as we are.
Do you really think we could all agree?
And why not?
You have already earned charges in a criminal conversation.
Tie them all up.
On your knees!
Hands behind your head!
Do what they say!
So promise me...
...that you will come back.
Okay.
I promise.
Fire!
Instructor!
The J채gerists have gathered and are combing the citadel!
Let's get out of here!
Who knows what they will do to you again?
No need.
There is no place for me anyway.
The military government has just cut off the back of the head and buried the body itself.
The people will support the J채gerists.
And they will seize power without hindrance.
And the old regime's survivors like me will simply be destroyed.
And I will no longer have the strength to rot in the desert of the United Mountain for the rest of my days.
Without your help, we would definitely be dead.
We will protect you, no matter what happens!
You fool!
Why, in your own way,
did I let a bunch of poor milk-suckers escape?
You will all obey the J채gerists.
You will never go against them.
You will still have to protect yourselves in the village.
Stay in the system for now.
How can that be?
But...
There will come a day when you will have to get up.
Until then,
don't forget who you really are.
I'm sorry.
Who you really are.
Armin!
Wait!
Even if you jump into Raghaku now,
we can't catch up with the horses.
Besides,
even if you catch up,
what will you do?
Will you tell him to make an attempt to turn Mom into a human?
I will.
Even if it doesn't work.
I have to show that I do everything in my power.
Otherwise,
we won't be able to earn Gabi's trust.
We need her.
It depends on her if we can persuade Reiner and the Titan Transporter,
who are still hiding somewhere.
The problem with the inheritance of the nine titans will not disappear.
In the worst case,
we will have to repeat 2000 years of fighting for the strength of the titans.
Right on this small island.
To be honest,
I'm so tired that I want to get into bed and sleep during the day.
But now,
I have to do everything I can.
It will greatly affect the dull future that humanity is waiting for.
I'll tell Konya
that it's better for him to stay with the titans than with Mom.
Bye.
Armin,
what should I do?
Help, for example, Jeanne.
Think a little yourself.
And what are we going to do with Armin?
How do I know?
And what can we do at all?
Hanje and the captain may have already been killed,
and Floch and his friends will look at us in the eye.
Above all,
Annie was certainly released.
The structure of the army has completely collapsed.
This is anarchy!
Oh yes,
maybe even history is in danger.
The volunteers of Azumabit and Nikola are also in a bad position.
So we can't let you think about Armin.
He is hopeless.
You understand, Mitesemal?
Sorry.
If it were up to me, Commander Sherwin,
he wouldn't have caused such a terrible hysteria.
I finally realized
that it was not necessary for me to bring you back to life.
Sharuk is gone.
For the sake of his mother,
it will not be easy to sacrifice a boy.
The horse is not exactly deep in thought and will waver.
You will surely have time.
Thank you, Blaus.
I'll hide at Mr. Blaus's house for now.
Okay.
You'd better get away as soon as possible.
Mia!
Take care of yourself.
Actually, my name is different.
I'm Gabi.
Huh?
That's a strange name.
I like Mia more.
What?
Bye, Kaya.
Goodbye, Gabi.
Flog, stop!
Don't shoot!
Relax, Jean.
I was just giving an obvious hint.
He didn't understand his position.
But now he's definitely got it.
What will happen if you don't keep your mouth shut?
Like everyone else.
Listen.
Who asked you to make a fool of yourself, Tsarev?
I don't know.
Listen.
Who asked you to make a fool of yourself, Tsarev?
Thank you for the question, Jean.
Listen, everyone!
Nine months ago, Aaron told me about his plan.
He was going to use Zika to gain the power of the Progenitor.
What?
I've got my allies.
I helped Aaron.
And today his plan came true.
You volunteers have lost the Progenitor.
And the support of the soldiers who listened to you.
And soon you will lose your homeland.
After the voice of the earth, only traces of giant legs will remain.
Now you are losing the dream of returning your land,
for which you have come to the island.
But if any of you still want to work for the sake of the Eldian Empire on this island,
then call!
We will gladly accept you and make you the so-called Eldians.
Go to hell, you bastard!
So we listened to you!
He did not tremble under the blow of the gun.
And until the end he remained a proud volunteer.
However, pride is not worth death.
There is nothing shameful in subjugation.
After all, it is better to live than to die for nothing and for nothing.
I'll give you time to think.
In the cell.
Yes!
Horror.
Jean, what happened here?
About your question.
I am the representative of Aaron.
While Aaron solves all our problems outside the island,
I will completely erase all hatred on the island itself.
No matter how it was four years ago.
We went through hell and finally got what we deserve.
Do you understand what I mean?
About freedom.
You don't have to fight anymore.
Live as you want.
Hey, Jean.
You wanted to go to the guard and sing to live in the capital.
That's what you should do.
You are one of our heroes.
Now everything is over.
Just like that.
Just become the same Jean.
The one who is self-satisfied and the one who is more annoying than the impudent.
What are you talking about?
Flock.
What happened to Hange and Levy?
Unfortunately, Zeke killed them.
Konya.
Thank you for saving me.
But why are we going to the north?
There.
The sun is setting there.
This time.
The danger in the south is better away from there.
You lost your memory and were taken to a safe hospital.
You were lying on the ground alone.
The truth.
I am a soldier and it is my duty to protect the weak.
Exactly.
That's why I became a soldier.
Konya.
Become a real soldier who protects everyone.
Dad, Sanya and Martin.
They are gone forever.
But I will bring mom back.
Wait a little, mom.
I became a soldier.
And now...
Thank you very much, Konya.
You are doing so much for me.
It's not worth it.
I am lucky that Konya is such a good man.
But I need to go back to the south.
I remember how I met my brothers and Gabi.
But what happened next?
Besides, I have a feeling that I have seen Konya somewhere before.
But if he doesn't know me, then it probably just seems.
To be continued...
Judging by the speed and direction, the garrisons are returning to Marley.
They saw the beginning of the bare ground and decided that the chances of survival in Marley were zero.
No.
The decision is reasonable.
As soon as possible, they will bring the news of what is happening home.
Still, it's much better than waiting for the titans to break them.
But...
Is it possible to do something now?
There is still a way to stop the catastrophe.
No.
In our forces, it is only a pity to rush to the very end.
Excuse me!
Wait!
Just don't eat.
I don't have any weapons.
Is there anyone else there?
Oh, don't worry.
He's just an innocent lover fighting death.
The army of the titans is unceasingly marching forward.
Those who watch as they trample on people who don't know anything,
will they stay still or go up to the battle?
Next, pride.
