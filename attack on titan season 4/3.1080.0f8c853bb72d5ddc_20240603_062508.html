        <pre>One day they abandoned us.
It is because of them that we have to live in an isolated zone.
It's all because of our relationship with demons.
And your father also left because of this.
After all, your father was a prayerful man.
And a prayerful man cannot be a liar.
But why are we not prayerful?
Exactly.
In those days, I wanted to become a warrior to be a prayerful man.
You are not walking here!
Live!
Dirty lazy pigs!
The title of the honorable prayerful man needs to be earned!
Have you heard the news?
In a few years, the attack on Paradis Island will begin.
That means we will soon get our giants.
Our seven will choose six at once.
Finally!
We will become prayerful!
Why are you so happy?
You will definitely not be chosen.
What are you talking about?
What are your strengths?
What?
Stability?
Smirking?
Accuracy?
Martial arts?
Nothing!
You are always trying to get involved in your works.
And the prayerful people appreciate it.
You are always talking about your loyalty and the emancipation of the demons of the island.
How dare you laugh at our mission?
Are you supporting the idea of restorers?
What?
No!
Don't mess with a fool!
I will report this to the commander!
Pull yourself together, you bastard!
You will catch me now!
That's enough, Porco!
You will not be helped in the plague of hatred on the island!
You will be here for 30 years!
Porco!
Let's go, Rick.
And you, stop whining.
This is because of you, not the commander.
Rainer.
I'm sorry.
Come on, Rainer.
Get up.
If I don't become an eagle, I won't be able to bring my father back to the family.
13 years is too long.
But I myself understand that it's too weak.
The decision is made by Neporco.
I believe that loyalty is also important.
Yes, Annie?
Huh?
What are you talking about?
I didn't hear.
Are you sure you really want this?
Huh?
13 years is too long.
In this time, I will become a hero.
I will destroy the demon on the island and save our world.
And then I will become the best son in the world.
If only something had happened.
Aaron, where are you?
THE END
The Gate of Hope.
Excellent.
They exceed expectations.
A female wasp.
The most versatile combat unit.
Together with high speed and endurance,
the use of hardening in hand-to-hand combat makes it a formidable enemy.
In addition, it is able to summon all pure giants nearby.
Leonhardt fits perfectly.
The armored giant specializes in hardening.
Its strength is enough to demolish any wall.
The giants that Marley's shield embodies
inherited an unwavering brawn.
The giant's jaw is created for attack.
It is small and agile enough.
And its teeth and claws will destroy anything.
He got a smart Marcel.
The beastlike remained the same.
He is a little higher than the rest of the giants.
And his throw technique turned out to be surprisingly destructive.
In addition, there is a special force in his blood.
The giant-transporter can hold its shape for a long time.
It is ideal for long-term tasks.
It can be equipped with weapons and armor,
which gives a tactical advantage.
The thought-out pick does a great job.
And finally, the colossal giant.
The giant's
God of Destruction.
Gouver has revealed its potential.
I'm even sorry for the demons from that island.
One day this beast will fall on their heads.
The new group of warriors is definitely stronger than the previous one.
I agree with the plans of the army.
To trust the return of the giant's founder to the children is pure madness.
Well, don't say it.
These very children just wiped the whole country from the face of the earth.
It can't be!
What kind of scare did they choose you from?
How did you do it?
You turned out to be weak.
Only in everything.
Wake up!
That's what we decided in the army!
Reiner, I'm sorry.
Father!
It's you!
Mother told me that you worked in this barracks.
You met here.
Do you remember Karina Braun?
Look, my mother and I became honorable marlites.
Now we can...
Shut up!
Did she send you?
She decided to take revenge?
What a shame!
She even gave you a warrior if she finds out that I'm the end of your father and my family!
I won't get into the loop.
You won't get away with this, got it?
Damn you!
I'll get the hell out of you!
Reiner!
Reiner!
Come back home!
Exactly.
I don't care about the nation.
I was chosen by the heir to the power of the armored giant.
I will be remembered as a hero who freed the world from demons.
I'm afraid we won't be able to go tonight.
It's too dark because of the clouds.
Even if we destroy the wall, where is the guarantee that the king will not use his power?
What are you talking about?
Believe Marley's research.
You're right.
We have nowhere to go.
We will attack the wall.
Tomorrow.
What's going on?
Don't you want to get rid of the demons on the island?
Did you forget what they did?
We are warriors.
We were chosen to give you to the demons in justice.
I'm sorry.
Reiner, I'm sorry.
If it weren't for me, you wouldn't have become a warrior.
I...
I tried my best to make you the best candidate.
She was a brother to Helvetal.
What?
I just wanted to protect him.
I'm sorry.
Reiner, I'm sorry.
Why?
You apologize.
Why?
You apologize.
I'm sorry.
Wertelt...
Eni...
He was eaten.
Because of me.
He was eaten.
And I will be eaten.
I will die here.
Come on.
It's the first time you've overtaken me at a long distance.
If we had caught that giant right away,
we wouldn't have lost our jaws.
Damn it.
We can't get Marseille back now.
But we can't be so far away from the wall of giants.
We're going back.
We need to get the jaw back.
It won't go far in human form.
We can't do it without the guidance of Marseille.
Wait.
No.
No!
We can't get Marseille back now.
Of course.
If we come back empty-handed,
they'll give the armored one to another.
But I don't care about your problems.
You think I'll be punished alone?
Why did you take it that only one of us will be blamed?
There is no guarantee that you will come out of the water dry.
It's pointless to chase after the jaw.
If he runs in the form of a giant,
none of us will catch him alive.
You can't get the power of a giant so quickly.
But you were able to control the colossal one right away.
Understand.
We have no other options.
If we don't get the Founder back,
the road home is closed.
You know,
even if you were so decisive last night,
we wouldn't have lost Marseille's jaw.
And now you decided to scare us
to save your skin?
Yes?
You'll tell Magat everything yourself.
You'll confess your guilt.
Got it?
Put your honor in the ass.
I was also chosen.
And the Marleyans and the Eldians,
they're all hypocrites.
In fact, everyone thinks only about themselves.
I'm not better, so I want to go home alive.
If you regret it, die.
I want to die for you.
Reiner is dead.
If you need Marseille,
I'll be Marseille.
Enough. Stop it already.
We have no other choice.
We all
have to
return.
What?
I wanted to become a warrior.
I wanted to fulfill my mother's dream
and live a happy,
full-fledged family.
It turned out that the Father
did not want us to know.
And my mother continues to
be devoured by unnecessary hopes.
I was not chosen at all.
I was not supposed to survive.
I was not supposed to survive.
I was not supposed to survive.
I was not supposed to survive.
Why did he apologize?
Why did he save me?
Why did he save me?
No.
I'm not ready to give up.
I'm not ready to give up.
After all, I still
could not understand him.
Where am I?
We are behind the Rose Wall.
Annie.
Bertolt.
I'm sorry.
Marcel.
I will become
a real warrior.
Speak!
Why did you come here?
To save humanity.
My village was
in the southeast part of the Rose Wall.
It was still bright.
Animals began to worry.
And I heard
some kind of rumble approaching.
When I realized that it was Shagito,
I decided to open the window.
I don't remember how I got to the horse.
But I
left three of your
accomplices there.
Hi, baby.
Since you decided to follow me,
you have a good taste for men.
I was born
in a permanent yard.
My mother worked there.
She always told me
about my father.
I recognized you right away.
How touching.
Raise your hands.
Dad will hug you.
Don't you believe me?
I've never heard worse jokes in my life.
I'm ready to swear even on my sister's grave.
You're cruel.
Dad!
Oh, well.
That's the first family quarrel.
Something new.
Judging by the legs, it's going to snow today.
No.
Look at your shoulders. It's going to be sunny.
Let's sit on the fence.
We're running late for the call.
Get up, Bertolt.
While you were playing
Tandrich or Backstabbing,
I was running
through the city canal.
That guy remembered me.
I'm not going anymore.
You say he remembered.
Let's go back to Marley with what we have.
They will be happy
with any information.
I have a doubt.
Five years of information collection
will be built.
Then tell me.
What do you suggest?
The Rose Wall should fall.
This is the only chance to lure the Founder's giants.
Then most of your friends
will die.
How many times to repeat?
They are not our friends.
They are demons.
But you need to trust them.
But your image of a hermit is more suspicious.
I'm sick of it.
Keep your nasty face away.
You're tired.
It's a pity that everything had to fall on you.
Let's end it for today.
I always dream
of one dream.
About the man who hung himself
on the farm.
I can't understand
why
he told us that story.
Aaron,
change your mind.
Don't torture yourself.
Damn it!
Rainer,
how do you do it?
How do I get
closer to you and Mikasa?
At such a pace
I die without
achieving anything.
Just do what you have to do.
And move forward.
What else do we have to do?
Yes, you're right.
You want to kill
all the giants,
don't give up.
Damn it!
I can't catch up with them.
Right.
I still have
them.
Hospital.
Dettel.
Hey!
I see you're going
for a correction.
You can already speak.
Well, yes.
Here they treat from emotional trauma.
But I don't have them.
I'm just pretending
that I don't remember anything.
I don't want to go home.
I can't look
into your eyes.
Will you report about me?
I won't tell anyone.
You're all beaten up.
Are you preparing to become a warrior?
Yes.
But I have no chance.
Another candidate is better than me in everything.
So I can't become a warrior.
That's good.
You're a good person.
I'm glad
that you'll live longer.
I don't want
another candidate to become a warrior.
Why?
This candidate
is a girl.
She has already been famous.
Thanks to her,
the war is over.
Everyone considers her
the best heir to the armored.
And I'm not strong enough
to defeat
or convince them.
In this place,
I began to think
how it happened before.
The soul and body are broken.
There is no freedom.
The personality is lost.
If they knew
what was coming,
no one would go to war.
However,
something constantly moving
makes people go to hell.
Most often,
it's not us who make the choice.
We are forced by circumstances
and the environment.
But those
who voluntarily go to hell
see it differently.
They are looking for something
beyond hell itself.
Is there hope
or even more?
Only those
who continue to move forward
will understand this.
To be continued...
To be continued...
To be continued...
The Tiber have arrived in the city.
Together with Magat,
they are preparing to tell the world the truth.
In the midst of a bustle of the festival,
Rainer is waiting for an unexpected meeting.
Next, from hand to hand.
