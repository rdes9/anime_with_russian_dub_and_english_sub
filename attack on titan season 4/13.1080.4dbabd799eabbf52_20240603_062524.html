These weapons are chemical.
This gauze contains a little of my brain fluid.
Breathing it, descendants of the world are paralyzed.
They lose control over their bodies until they lose consciousness.
Then they obediently follow orders.
It is only worth pointing out the necessary coordinates.
That's why, becoming giants, people from that village followed my orders.
It had a name, the village of Ragaku.
Don't you dare forget the name of the village that you destroyed, bearded asshole.
Well, I didn't want that at all.
But if I didn't, it would be obvious that I was on the side of Eldia.
And then a new hope of this island was crying.
You know, I'm telling you this, barely going to your shore.
What's the point of screwing up the past?
I want to understand if you feel a drop of your guilt.
Do you want to save Eldia or not?
But you didn't care about those people in your life.
I don't think you liked girls.
No one loves those who are blind who understand other people's feelings.
But I understand.
And I liked girls.
Oh, that's right.
Well, so when we're already with Aaron, let's get started.
It's not up to me.
We're waiting for orders from above.
It looks like they think they have time in the car.
But that's not true.
Yeah, I agree with you on that.
Captain Levy!
What?
Is that true?
THE END
The Children of the Forest
Those are the Charoms!
I've never seen anything like this in my life!
And me...
Are you lucky today, children?
Are you going to eat normally today?
Yes.
What's wrong with you, Mia?
Are you sick?
Oh, no!
Don't worry, Mia!
I knew it. You're like you ran out of the forest.
Oh, that's not true!
Kaia!
Does this Marley really work here?
Yeah, so take it in your hands.
The military often come here.
It'll be good if we find this Marley here.
Mr. Brause!
Welcome to our restaurant!
Thank you very much for the invitation.
Oh, yeah!
You've brought a whole crowd.
You said it was thanks to the restaurant.
So I invited my whole family.
It's okay.
Enough food for everyone.
Sit down at the table.
I'm dying of hunger, Dad!
Me too!
We didn't eat on purpose!
It's Nikola.
He's the Marley I told you about.
Maybe he'll help you.
But Mr. Brause isn't from the military.
So why did you invite him?
His daughter was from the intelligence.
She saved me.
Nikola and Mr. Brause met at her grave.
And Nikola promised to treat him with her favorite food.
I think there was love between her and Nikola.
Ben, what's wrong?
Did you have a stomachache?
No!
It's delicious!
I've never had anything so delicious in my life!
Wait a minute!
You haven't tasted the main course yet!
Nikola, we have a guest.
What? Who's that?
The intelligence.
Oh, it's you.
What's the matter?
Is it urgent?
I'm just a little busy here, you know.
Oh, work and don't get distracted.
It's just that when you're done, we need to talk to you.
Talk?
About what?
Well, you know, about everything.
What's wrong?
They're investigating our arrest.
I hope you'll help.
Okay, fine.
Wait for me here.
Wow, what a room you have.
Probably a hall for high-ranking officials.
What's this?
The wine that all the guys are talking about?
They say that such pleasure is only available to the highest officials.
Really?
Well, we're not the senior intelligence in the region.
Yeah, I think we deserve a little.
Well, at least we can have a couple of sips.
Put it down!
Calm down, Nikola.
We were just fooling around.
Don't go crazy.
It's a great wine, not for the ldits at all.
Nikola, are you still talking about things like that?
Bottles with booze.
I don't care where you're from.
Don't touch me, ldits.
The fact that I'm being polite doesn't mean that we're friends.
And you seem to be completely scared.
Have you forgotten that you're...
A pathetic prisoner.
Just like you, ldits.
What's wrong with him?
Damn it.
Who the hell knows?
It's time.
Oh, my stomach suddenly hurt.
Is everything okay, Ben?
Maybe it's too much.
I need to go to the bathroom.
I'll go with him.
What if my brother needs help?
Good luck.
What are you...
The bathroom is the other way.
We're not looking for the bathroom, we're looking for you, Nikola.
We're from Marley.
We're candidates for the war.
What?
We think there's going to be an attack on the island soon.
The whole world has united against them.
That's why we can't wait any longer.
Tell everyone who's in the basement about it.
Okay, wait.
And what are the candidates for the war doing here?
Liberio was attacked by the Paradis demons.
When they retreated, we got on their ship and arrived at the island.
You...
Killed someone?
A girl?
A military girl?
Yes, I killed her.
I just killed a couple of them.
However, our place has only just begun.
For everything they've done.
Don't doubt it.
We're full of revenge for everything.
What do you care?
So you killed her.
So you killed Sasha!
You even infected her!
Sasha loves you!
What?
Nina?
Solzhenitsyn!
Falko! Falko! Falko! Wake up! Wake up!
Tell me what's going on! Falko!
Nikola, what did you do to Ben and Mia?
She's the one who killed Sasha.
What the hell did she do to your daughter's life?
She's an innocent child. She's a professional Marley soldier.
She got on a ship that flew out of Marley and shot your daughter.
She killed Sasha.
Daughter?
Mr. Braus.
Take it.
But if it's not you, I'll kill her myself.
Don't you mind?
What's going on? Hey, everybody, come here!
What? What's going on?
The killer, Sasha?
What are they doing here, Nikola?
I heard they're on the run.
What are you thinking? Hey!
Get away! I'll avenge Sasha! Get away!
Don't! Falko has nothing to do with this!
And who is he to you, huh?
He's locked you up!
He's not indifferent to you!
You know, I had a man like that too!
A girl! A hell of a woman!
The one who loved my striploin more than anyone else!
The one who saved me from this damn war!
And the one who showed me what my happiness is about!
To please people with delicious food!
That's what Sasha Braus was like!
And you took her from me!
On that day, many people died that were dear to me!
They were shot at by your ungrateful Sasha Braus!
That's the reason for my revenge!
She was the first to die!
What difference does it make who started first?
Remember!
You're a Marley soldier too!
This devil has bewitched you!
The demons are wicked! Wake up!
Nikola, give me the knife.
Here.
Mr. Braus!
Don't!
Calm down.
Put the knife down.
Sasha was a hunter.
What?
Since childhood, she has been working with onions in the thicket of the forest.
And she was getting food for us.
That's what life was like for us.
But...
It couldn't go on like this.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
But...
It couldn't go on like this forever.
I understood it well.
I told her to leave the forest.
Then she went out into the world.
She became a soldier, shot at people in distant lands and...
In the end, she got the bullet herself.
As a result, she left the forest.
The whole world turned out to be the same forest where you have to kill others to survive.
I see that Sasha died because she wandered around this forest for too long.
At least we have to help children get out of it.
Otherwise, everything will repeat itself again and never stop.
That's why all the offenses and sins of the past should be taken by adults.
Nikola!
Let Ben go!
Okay, Liza.
Be careful.
Yeah.
Are you hurt?
No.
Are you feeling better?
Do you...
...hate me?
Kaia!
How dare you kill her!
Murderer!
I thought we were friends!
We need to get her out of here.
No one tried the main course.
Hange!
We need to wash the mouth of that boy.
Wine could have gotten in there.
Huh?
Although...
I think it's too late.
What's wrong with the wine?
Nothing.
It's just a spinal-brain liquid from Zika.
So, Zaklai is dead?
Yes.
The Yagerists have taken over the city from within the walls.
It seems so.
It's all part of Zika's plan.
Eren and Lena only paid him back.
And now?
Now.
The Yagerists will get whatever they want by meeting Eren and Zika.
What about Pixis?
He didn't approve of it.
Yes, you're right.
The commander has his own plans for this.
Looks like he decided to feed Eren to someone else.
With our own hands.
Yeah, that's right.
I saved Eren time and time again.
And in the meantime, our comrades were killed.
But I believed that it was he who was the hope of humanity.
Believed.
And that's what my faith has led to.
It looks like a stupid joke.
What the hell did we hope for?
We risked everything for this farce.
What a nonsense, it's not even funny.
It would be better if we fed our own to someone else.
What does it mean?
What did you take that contains brain fluid?
I don't have any proof.
But this wine was brought on the first reconnaissance ships.
All the barrels were filled with it.
Why did we need so much wine?
And more.
And more.
When I started working here as a cook,
I was ordered to serve it to senior officers.
Who ordered it?
Elena.
According to my information, she was the one who ordered it.
Maybe there were other volunteers.
I don't understand what he's talking about.
I hear it for the first time.
What a dog.
If someone from the Eldians drank it, it would paralyze him.
If Zigg didn't lie about it,
we know how it works only from his words.
And such a little lie can play such a terrible role.
If the officers didn't act,
no one would think that they were fed with brain fluid.
Yes, but we're not sure, are we?
Yes, there is no confirmation.
But the military of Marley doesn't need to explain how it works.
Everyone already knows.
How did you use it?
Ten years ago, we captured the capital of the enemy in one night.
Hundreds of giants appeared right in the city.
The officers will turn into giants.
Otherwise, why would we have to serve the higher ranks of the army with this wine?
It seems that when you put it on us so that we don't drink this wine,
you were protecting us.
It can't be.
I don't know what happened to me.
I came here to help destroy the demons of the island.
Instead, I gave up the military secret and soon I will be finished.
Mr. Braus, I don't want to be as wise as you,
but I did something as a humiliation.
I almost killed the child.
It's madness.
No one.
Why did you protect me?
Just like that.
You don't need a reason for that.
But I killed your friend.
And I hit the guard with a stone when we were running away.
Falcon has nothing to do with it.
Kill me, but not him.
We won't kill anyone.
But don't you want that?
I don't want it at all.
Everything you say is about killing.
Is there really no other way?
Just like him.
What's going on?
Commander Hange.
Flog?
All right, what are you doing here?
I guess you know where Zika is hiding.
And you'll take us to him.
Wait.
There's no point in fighting among ourselves.
We don't care what you suggest.
There will be no negotiations.
And?
Why is that?
That's the order of Aaron.
Pyxis would never agree to entrust the fate of the island to us.
At the moment, he is developing a plan to intercept Aaron while he goes to Zika.
Are you out of your mind?
Or did your agents, introduced to the capital police, tell you that?
Am I one of your servicemen who is obliged to answer your every question?
I advise you to start moving before I show you in action.
What's wrong with that?
Damn it.
How did they know we were here?
Grace?
Are you working for Elena?
Nikola, you got too close to the Eldians.
I knew this day would come.
Did I do the right thing by not telling you how to contact them?
Flog, listen.
We don't have time to fight among ourselves.
The wine with the spinal fluid of Zika was drunk by all the military.
Zika just fooled us all.
Everything is going according to his plan.
So what?
Were these policemen big idiots?
They will become huge.
Let's go.
I didn't say anything about the policemen.
It can't be.
Did you know about the wine?
Please be quiet and orderly.
We're moving out.
Yes.
Is that voice Flog and his comrades?
Yes.
Guys, we need to talk.
