Mikasa, what do you think? Do you want to save Eren?
I want to, but I'm sure, as Eren said,
because I'm Akkermann, and not at all by my own will.
What? I think it's all pure water, Eren's invention.
Sometimes my head really hurts. Why are you sure he's lying?
What do you mean why?
Are you seriously thinking that Eren wants to have children?
Eren wants to have children?
And it's true, it seemed to me that it didn't look like him, even if it could be.
It can't be! After all, it's about Eren!
Then why doesn't he say anything to Zeke and Eren?
And he doesn't have to say anything!
In the end, it's only up to him to decide how to use the power of the parents.
When Elena came to him with an idea and plan, Eren had no choice.
Who knows what she would go to when she heard the refusal?
But if Eren agrees and convinces her that he is on their side,
then he will be able to arrange the Golden Earth and protect the island!
Then in the next 50 years no one will touch Paradise!
Can we go now?
I'm sorry. Wait a little longer.
He's been saying he's dangerous since he was a kid.
That this bastard will bring us all to hell.
I'm so envious of him.
He was so cool.
It's pissing me off before I die!
But I don't want him to be killed now!
But if Eren dies, I won't be able to beat his face!
Let's go, Eren!
Let's go!
If Eren hides his true intentions, then why did he push us away?
He said he hated me.
Why would he do that to Eren?
Probably...
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Probably...
If all our enemies die on that shore,
we'll finally be free.
Really?
At least, Eren and I have known for a long time that you often have a headache.
He added it to his lies to make it more believable.
He had to come up with everything.
Let's ask Eren when it's all over.
Don't forget.
This operation is built on the sacrifice of Tiber.
He risked his life to tell us how we need the true hero Gelos.
The hero who will save the world.
Eren.
Enough already.
You've lost.
Enough.
You've caused pain to others.
Enough.
Suffer by yourself.
What is this battle for?
What are you fighting for?
What are you fighting for?
Goliath!
Damn!
That was close.
Eren.
I want to put an end to everything.
What do we look like?
Enough already.
That's it.
Go to sleep!
Eren!
Eren!
Eren!
Eren!
Eren!
Eren!
Eren!
Eren!
Eren!
Eren!
Eren!
Eren!
Eren!
Eren!
He's here.
Wonderful child.
I was a little late.
But I still arrived at the meeting place.
Well done that you survived alone.
Eren.
Now give everything to your brother.
Eren!
Eren!
Eren!
Eren!

Eren!
Damn!
Zigg!
Let's shoot his head!
Turn around!
Yes!
Revive, Epic!
Take the transporter to the cellar!
Yes, sir!
The beast is about to shoot us!
Let's get out of here, or he'll kill us!
The progenitor is approaching the beast!
And yet they want to meet the titans!
We need to stop him!
What? How?
Only the other titans can handle the titans!
And we have our own battle!
I'll go save Falco from the enemy fortress!
And you go to the south, to the evacuation point!
No, I'm with you!
Falco is here on my behalf!
And at the same time, he saved me several times!
I had better grades,
and now I'm like a helpless fool!
I can't just take the first one and run away!
Open up!
What's going on outside?
I don't want to die locked up!
Hey, let me out!
It's probably the Marley people on the ground.
Maybe they came to save you.
The Marley army wouldn't come after me.
The savior of the Indians is not in their rules.
But you have a family waiting for you at home.
There will be no other chance to come back.
And I will never see my wife and daughters again.
All I have to do is scream,
like I'm turning into a monster.
And I haven't told my girls so much yet.
I don't care that I'm already dead.
Hey! Stop!
This is the area under the control of the Yagerists!
We won't let you!
Tell me, Kakadid,
do you want to risk your life to not let us
save His Majesty the Yager?
No.
Open all the cameras!
Instructor Shadis?
Konya.
You just had a fight with a bear.
I'm not in time for that.
Go.
Commander Pixis!
Is everything okay with you?
I haven't caught a cold yet.
Just a little.
I just drank a little.
Listen carefully, soldiers!
There's a very limited number of attacks here.
First of all, those who don't have a black bandage take them.
And those who were successfully caught in the trap with the wine,
follow me!
Let's meet the invaders at the front line!
Yes!
I'm glad.
We're fighting on the same side again.
Are you fighting for common goals?
Yes.
And you won't take the scarf with you?
I won't.
Let's go.
All of them have been shot down!
The turning point of history!
It's coming!
It seems...
Now the help is not needed for Aaron,
but for Rainer.
Why...
is Zig...
here?
Captain Levy would never let him free!
Hey!
What's wrong with Captain and Hans?!
The most logical thing is that they're not here.
Captain Levy would never let him free!
Hey!
What's wrong with Captain and Hans?!
The most logical thing is that they're not here.
He held down this promise and then
appeared in the right place at the right time.
It can't be!
Too bad there's no other way out!
Only this way Zig and Aaron can save the world.
Let's join the Jägerists
and help them meet together!
Please help Eren and Zyko. I believe in you, Armin.
The ship is falling!
Damn it!
By the way, what is this iron pipe?
Anti-tank rifle.
You just have to get to the center of the head, otherwise it's very difficult to kill the titans.
They're coming out!
The whole city is on fire!
There's nowhere to hide!
What are you talking about? Fight!
What is it?
Damn it!
We got caught!
This is my brother.
I see.
Let's go, Marley prisoner.
I'll lock the prisoner in one of the houses.
We'll go forward.
Then quickly catch up.
We'll have to shoot.
Stop!
This is not a place for children.
Come back home.
Let's go!
Neil, thank you.
They seem to have left.
Gabi,
why did you trust the enemy?
Well...
Come here!
The fire won't stop here.
I know.
But on the contrary, it's all getting worse.
We'll hide here until the fight is over.
I pray that Mia and Ben run away too.
These two will take it all.
The guys are strong.
Let them die.
Why are you worried about those who killed my sister?
I would have killed them myself.
They seem to have left.
It's time for us to go.
Gabi?
There were no devils.
Only people live on this island.
Finally,
I realized what Rainer felt.
And we all
stuck to the devils of people
who had never even seen them.
Again and again.
It's all repeating again and again.
I'm sorry, Falco.
You understood everything.
And I dragged you into it.
I helped them attack Liberio.
I talked to the wounded in the hospital,
and he turned out to be Aaron Yeager.
And I threw his letters to his allies
in a box outside the camp.
A lot of people died in Liberio.
That's why...
That's why I'm to blame for the death of Uda Sofi.
That's it.
And I love you.
I don't want you to inherit the armored Titan.
That's why I went to the candidates.
So that we could get married
and live long and happy.
I want you to live long!
What are you talking about?
I can soon become a Titan.
I wanted to tell you everything.
Let's go!
If Dadim Zika finds out that you drank
brain fluid,
maybe he won't scream.
Yeah.
It's useless!
There are too many enemies!
Aaron can't break through!
Aaron,
there's not much left.
Just a little bit more and our dream will come true.
Just a little bit more.
What's there?
A transporter Titan?
And this is where death found you,
poor pig.
Yes! And we killed the transporter!
We killed the transporter!
We killed the transporter!
We killed the transporter!
We killed the transporter!
I just wanted to catch him.
Who hit him?
Isn't that you?
Catch them!
There's only one chance to hit the tank.
Marshal Magat!
YOU
Finish him off, Lera…
Brown, don't let the beast and the progenitor touch each other!
I knew it, Eren.
Stop it already!
The last man who must possess this power...
Eren...
It's you!
You, hurry up!
If he has a bunch of life left in him...
He will scream for sure!
Don't be sad, we're all free.
So, like a bird, if you have wings, you can go anywhere.
But if you don't have a place to go home, you can't go anywhere.
I just don't want to live.
The world is cruel, but I still love you.
No matter what you sacrifice, I'll still protect you.
No matter what you sacrifice, I'll still protect you.
No matter what you sacrifice, I'll still protect you.
No matter what you sacrifice, I'll still protect you.
The beast and the progenitor.
Two titans with a key to the current events.
The fight is getting hot.
What is waiting for the brothers ahead?
Next, two brothers.
