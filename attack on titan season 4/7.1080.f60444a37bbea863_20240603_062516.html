        <pre>Now the Founder is ours!
Taran!
What the...
He did it!
Is it really Ackerman?
What the hell!
I'm a giant after all!
A giant?
Ordinary people are going to kill me?
So what are you?
Demons?
Paradise?
Behind! Behind!
Back off!
Damn!
Too fast!
Bastard!
He's here too!
Translator!
Run!
Barely made it.
That's what I knew.
Large-caliber machine guns are the most effective against them.
It wasn't in vain that we wasted time.
What the hell is that?
What the hell is that?
What the hell is that?
What the hell is that?
What the hell is that?
Taran!
There he is.
A beast like him.
Zeke!
I'm going to kill you, Eren Yeager!
Don't let them get away.
Let them go.
Kill them all.
Don't die.
Survive!
The End
The End
Attack.
Attack.
Attack.
Attack.
Attack.
Attack.
Attack.
Attack.
Attack.
Attack.
Attack.
Attack.
Attack.
Attack.
Attack.
Attack.
Attack.
Attack.
Taran!
Taran!
What the hell is that?
No, Eren Yeager!
You'll pay for this!
Commander!
Brown!
Brown!
I'm sorry!
It's my fault!
He's alive!
But...
...without consciousness.
The owners of the power of giants, all wounds heal very quickly.
They just need to want to live.
But...
I can't take it anymore.
Please, kill me!
Commander, I'll help you.
You know, you're surrounded not only by enemies.
There's me and Gabi.
And the rest.
We're all your comrades.
I'll be back soon.
Mr. Brown!
He's attacking!
Bastard!
Hey, stop!
You'll get it now!
You'll get it now!
We're going after them, Commander!
Yes, sir!
Behind you!
I can't get him!
Goliath!
We're saved!
Thank you, Porco!
We wouldn't have made it without you!
Here's Nachiko.
I lost Ackerman to Rizvid.
He's somewhere nearby.
What?
Porco is dead!
The same crystal as Enni's.
He's no match for my giant.
But you don't have any power left.
If you had any reserve,
you would have pierced my back a long time ago.
You have no other chance.
But I have a couple of them.
Damn it!
That bastard!
He still has power left.
That's bad!
But if we beat him,
our founder...
Why are you so confused, Porco?
Huh?
There's no need to hurry now.
We're holding the battlefield under control.
The enemy's forces are already at the outskirts.
They don't have any reserves of fuel and weapons.
After all, they arrived here at the UMP.
Here, on the enemy territory,
they're like rats locked up in a corner.
Most likely, Marley's army
has completely taken over the ghetto.
They have nowhere to retreat.
Not many people live on the island.
They don't have enough strength
to fight Marley in a real war.
That's why we need to capture the founder.
Without his power, they won't be able to call the gul.
Why are we so slow?
He's right in front of us.
That's why we can't hurry with our actions.
Now our task is not to let Ackerman
get to the commander.
That's right, Peter.
You're absolutely right.
Let's go!
Eren Yeager
is not the most dangerous enemy.
We'll start with you.
Come out, Levi.
Your time is running out.
Wow!
Commander Zieg!
He's incredible!
Groiss!
Commander Magat!
Commander!
He's on the square!
Where are you from?
How are you?
Are you hurt?
I'm fine.
Then get out of here!
But...
Vice-Commander Brown is on the square!
He's been destroyed!
What?
It's my fault.
He...
protected me.
Who did it?
Eren...
Yeager.
Get in the car!
We need to get the troops to Liberia!
They have huge losses there!
And you, on a fishing boat!
Can't you see the fleet?
Hey!
Our...
fleet!
Don't stand there!
Run away from here!
Commander Magat!
There's...
They destroyed the fleet!
This is the only thing they're capable of!
A colossal giant!
The giant of Merdelta
has captured the enemy!
Damn it!
What the hell!
What the hell is going on?
Damn it!
What the hell!
But of course,
they didn't come to us
without any plan.
Well, I'll give you
hell!
I'll take the Founder,
and then you're all dead!
One more Ackerman!
Get out of the way!
Commander,
the enemy is going to attack.
Zeke!
Zeke!
Lie down!
Zeke!
Mrs. Peek!
The enemy is coming!
Zeke!
What's going on?
Hey,
Carlo!
Hey,
answer me!
Carlo!
How dare you!
One hour
to pay!
Now!
Fire!
Zeke!
Guys!
Zeke!
Peek!
Zeke!
Now I know
what you saw
that day,
Bertolt.
Please,
stop it.
Forward!
Let's finish him!
Stop!
Don't shoot!
Did I miss
because of the steam?
Or
did I
break my arm?
Peek!
Follow me,
transporter!
Run,
quickly!
Peek!
I'm alive!
Zeke!
Zeke!
Zeke!
Zeke!
Protect Peek!
Damn you,
you evil demons!
Brown,
help Grice!
Yes, sir!
Back!
Keep your distance!
Come here,
quick!
First,
the commander,
and now
Peek!
Damn,
damn,
damn!
What the hell!
Quick!
But also
the mistake
when you
went for his
cheek!
Quick!
And the world
in the form of a face
was different!
So,
that is a face
Thanks to the jaw, I see.
It's terrible.
Her regeneration is not working.
But she's got the power of a giant, right?
A giant is not a very lively transporter.
This one is not armored.
What about Reiner? Where is he now?
You said that Eren Yeager killed him with fragments!
Can he fight? Tell me!
I don't know.
He's behind the stage.
But I think...
I think we should leave Reiner alone now!
What are you talking about?
Uda and Sofia...
So many people died there because of Eren Yeager!
Hey, Gaby!
Don't come near the windows! The enemy will see us!
Commander!
Wooah!
Commander, signal lights fire on each course!
Perfect! So everything goes according to our plan.
So... it's up to you, O n√© incoupon.
I won't let you down, Mrs. Hange!
We're going into the ghetto at a low altitude.
We're following the signal fire and picking up our men.
If they miss the opportunity, all of our men will be doomed.
And if they kill the director, we'll kill them too.
That's an absolutely crazy plan.
You look like you're possessed by Duherwin.
It's a pity it's not true.
He would have given us the power.
The thing is,
if we don't return Aaron and the others,
we won't have a future.
Jean, they're here.
Yes, just in time.
Naive.
They decided to get away with this?
To hell with them!
What?
Wait!
No!
Enough!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Stop it!
What did he do?
What did he do?
He ate the hammer.
And the next one will be the honor.
How could this be?
Even Goliath?
No.
No!
Reiner!
Protect me!
Gilead will eat me now!
Protect me!
Shut up.
I want to rest.
Reiner!
Reiner!
Please.
Don't.
Save us!
Reiner!
Stop it.
Shut up.
Enough.
Why...
are you all...
important?
Do you let me
die or not?
I don't know who you are
The proof that I was here
The bones will melt anyway
And disappear
The bones will melt anyway
And disappear
I'm alive
The armored giant was defeated
Wanting to take revenge for his homeland
Gabby grabs the rifle and attacks
Next, the cancer bullet
