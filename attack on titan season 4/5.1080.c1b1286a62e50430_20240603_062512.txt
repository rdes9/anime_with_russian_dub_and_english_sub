One dream I dream all the time about a man who hanged himself in the village.
I still can't understand why he told us his story.
To be honest, I have no idea.
Most likely he wanted to confess.
But we abandoned Marcel ourselves.
So we can't forgive him.
For some reason it seemed to me that the man wanted someone to judge his actions.
Hello.
It's been four years, Rainer.
I was told that you were old friends.
Right, Mr. Krüger?
Yes.
And we have so much to do.
I don't even know where to start.
It can't be.
Aaron.
THE END
THE END
THE END
Announcement of war.
Lord Iber, it's time for you to go.
Yes.
Well, well.
I'm glad to see you, representative of the Azumabit family.
Have you come to cheer me up?
I hope you didn't get in the way.
I just wanted to see you.
I'm a little worried.
It's scary to perform in front of a crowd.
It's okay.
You have enough time to get used to it.
It's okay.
You have enough courage.
We know very well what you're capable of.
We will pray for your success.
Thank you, Mrs. Kiyomi.
Sit down, Rainer.
Great sheets.
From here you will hear everything.
And right above us is a residential complex.
You can't see the stage.
But the people are busy at home and now the performance is waiting for them.
And these people are right above us.
Oh, Mr. Krueger, are you hurt?
Oh, it's just a scratch.
Rainer, sit down.
Okay, I have to go back.
No, Falco.
You should stay and listen.
Falco, do as they say.
Yes, sir.
And now it's time to go.
I'm glad to see you, Mr. Leonhart.
Mrs. Braun, we haven't seen each other since your son came back from the island.
I heard that Mr. Gouver died in a dream.
Yes.
He was always proud that his son gave up his life for Marley.
That's all he said.
I'm sure your daughter...
She didn't die.
She's not alive.
She promised to come back home.
I can't believe we chose the ghetto as one of the possible places to declare war.
Wow, even Marshal Calvi came.
I can't believe the whole army gathered in the ghetto.
And together with the ambassadors from all over the world.
And not to mention the reporters from all major publications.
It's like the whole world is looking at us.
It's hard to believe that the Tiber are so influential.
But they're also Eldians.
It's starting.
Where did Falco and Mr. Braun go?
Marley warriors.
Commander Magat is calling for you.
Aaron.
How?
Why are you here?
We have one reason.
Don't you get it?
We're the same.
We both have a reason.
We both have a reason.
We both have a reason.
We're the same.
We both have a reason.
It seems to be starting.
Let's listen.
I'll tell you a story.
It happened hundreds of years ago.
When the Jewish Empire ruled this world with the help of the power of giants.
Since the day the founder of the emir appeared.
The number of victims of the hands of giants has exceeded three times the number of people who have lived to this day.
Because of the giants.
Many peoples and their culture.
Were extracted from the history of our world.
The massacre of the Eldians.
Changed the course of human history.
And at that moment.
When the Eldians had no enemies.
They started to kill each other.
The great war of giants began.
Seven and eight giants.
Began the hostility.
And in this hostility.
One Marley saw the way to victory.
And there was the hero Gelos.
He ignited even more chaos.
The Eldians with their own hands.
Destroyed their empire.
Then the hero united with the Tiber.
Together they forced the invincible king Fritz.
Run from the mainland to the island of Paradis.
However.
The king who fled to the island.
Saved his strength.
Thousands of giants capable of destroying the world.
Expect their time.
The fact that our world for some unknown reason.
Still not stopped.
Pure luck.
That's what experts say about giants.
Recently, the Marley sent four giants.
To neutralize the threat of the island.
But the plan failed.
We managed to return only to the armored.
Which means.
To beat the human history.
The Eldian Empire lives and flourishes.
I heard, Reiner.
That's why you broke the wall.
You believed that you were saving the world.
Isn't it?
The Jäger is ordered to go to the gate.
Yes.
And you two follow me.
I think I saw you somewhere.
Where did you serve?
To the west of Lakua.
I came here with reinforcements.
And I have no desire to have a conversation with the Eldians.
Very sorry.
And I liked your beard so much.
This is a peak!
Tankers?
Thank you for working on the holidays.
And thank you for the peak.
And you have a good mood.
There's no time to chat. Let's go.
Hey, what are you doing?
Well, they always go to the transporters.
We have a special connection.
Something tells me that their connection has just weakened.
Any news?
So far, nothing has been reported.
Tell your own.
Let them report about each rustle.
Yes, sir.
Come here.
And where is the commander?
Borka!
I can't understand.
Why?
Why is Mr. Brown so scared?
After all, Kruger is his old friend.
Stop.
How long have they been friends?
If it's been four years, then they met on the island.
No.
It can't be.
After all, then...
It can't be.
Really?
So, the story that I told is known to everyone.
However, in fact, everything was different.
And now the Tiber family will share the memories of the giant hammer.
And today, from this scene, the true story will be heard for the first time.
About a hundred years ago,
the Great War of the Giants ended not even Gelos and not even the Tiber.
The one who put an end to the war and saved our world was King Fritz.
He was saddened by the cruelty of the Eldian Empire.
He was tired of eternal despair,
and most of all, he was saddened by the fate of the eternally oppressed marauders.
As soon as he inherited the giant founder,
he offered the Tiber a plan according to which the war would end the hero of the marauders.
And they called him Gelos.
The king brought as many Eldians to the island as he could
and closed the gates of his walls.
He said that in case of a threat,
thousands of giants would go to his place.
However, he would not do this.
King Fritz wanted to pass on his ideals of inheritance,
so he created the oath of the world.
Thanks to the oath, the ideology of Karl Fritz was inherited by his descendants.
It was because of her that the giants still did not leave the island.
As a result, we were protected by the one we knew as the despicable King Fritz.
Karl Fritz with his desire for peace.
He always wanted only peace.
If the marauders stood up and decided to destroy the royal family and take the founder,
he would have accepted it.
He sincerely believed that the sins of the Eldians were so great that they could not be bought.
And yet, until the hour of revenge has come,
let us enjoy the paradise that is fenced off by external conflicts.
This is my only request.
With these words, the king left us.
What does it all mean?
If it's true...
The marauders did not save the world?
It's just that King Fritz wanted everyone to think so.
If the king is not going to destroy the world inside the walls,
then why are we so afraid of this island?
That's right.
We, the Tiber family, have bought our own security.
We talked to Karl Fritz and sold the Marley Eldians.
The Tiber family is no more than pathetic traitors,
who sleep on other people's laurels.
I stand here in front of you and reveal this deception,
because I realize what a threat has hung over our world.
Commander!
The warriors are gone.
They left with some soldier and did not return.
Hurry up and mobilize the search squad.
Yes, sir!
Here it starts.
Damn, it hurts!
What does it all mean?
This is a special trap for the warriors.
A regular pit, but you can't transform.
Especially the two of us.
Dan, let's crush each other.
I still don't understand what this fool is thinking.
No idea.
But I'm sure I know him.
See how I pay for my sins.
Karl Fritz used the power of the Founding Giant
to erect three walls.
These three walls consist of thousands of colossal giants.
They serve as a shield and a sword in the fight for peace.
However, several years ago there was a coup on the island.
Fritz's ideals sank in the summer,
and the Founding Giant took over someone else.
Our world is once again in danger.
The executioner who threatens the world,
his name is Aaron Yeager!
You lied to me.
I believed you.
They just took me and lied to me.
Forgive me, Falk.
You helped me a lot.
Those letters!
Those letters that I sent!
My family didn't get them.
But they got allies.
No!
What did I do?
Allies?
The threat of paradise.
The action of the army of colossal giants is a coup.
As I said earlier, the royal family is bound by the oath of peace
and cannot use the entire power of the Founding Giant.
Only now does Aaron Yeager own the Founding Giant
and no oaths are bound by it.
As soon as we hear this coup,
it will be too late,
and humanity will only listen to their actions and shout in terror.
All our cities and countries will be destroyed.
They will literally be compared to the Earth.
That's true.
Gilly Tiber is right.
I'm a bad guy,
and I can destroy this world.
Just for me,
but you were bad guys too.
That day, when the wall fell,
the giants took over my city.
They ate my mom in front of me.
I can't understand it.
Tell me, Reiner,
why did my mom eat a giant that day?
Because that day,
we made a hole in the wall.
Why did you make a hole in the wall?
To get inside without understanding.
I appreciate the king's reaction.
What is all this for?
To bring the Founding Giant back
and save the world.
I see.
Since you tried to save the world,
you had no choice.
You once said
that you would do everything
to make us die in the most terrible torments.
Is that why you came here?
Oh, I think there was something like that.
Huh?
Forget about it.
In those days,
I considered all enemies who lived beyond the ocean.
But now I crossed the ocean,
slept with the enemy under one roof,
fed him with food.
Reiner,
you and I are the same.
There are bastards among you,
but there are also good ones.
Beyond the ocean,
inside the walls,
the world is the same.
But you guys
learned that only demons live inside the walls.
You have been brainwashed
by demons.
You were children.
You had no choice.
Tell me, Reiner,
do you still have a conscience?
No.
It's not like that, Aaron.
The day
when Marcel was eaten
and they wanted to leave the mission
with Bertolt
and return home.
But I scared them
and made them continue.
I wanted to be a hero.
I wanted respect.
It's my fault.
Because of me, your mom was eaten by a giant.
Because of me!
I despise my people.
I, like no one else,
longed to destroy the Eldians.
I can't take it anymore.
Please, kill me.
But I don't want to die at all.
I was born for something in this world.
And let us belong to different races and nations.
Now, in front of the common enemy,
we must unite.
And now
I ask for help from those who also want to live.
Those who believe in our future!
By uniting our efforts,
we will overcome any difficulties.
We really
look alike.
I ask you to stand shoulder to shoulder
and throw out the devil from the island of Paradis!
Perhaps, this is a birth.
I, Willy Tybur,
as a legitimate representative of the will of the state of Marley,
I will not stop until
I destroy the enemies.
I declare war on the island of Paradis!
I declare war on the island of Paradis!
I declare war on the island of Paradis!

The Attacker
An attacking giant has appeared from nowhere.
With a thunderous roar, he kills an innumerable number of people.
In response to this crime, the RNA will be judged as a hammer.
Next, the giant is a hammer.
