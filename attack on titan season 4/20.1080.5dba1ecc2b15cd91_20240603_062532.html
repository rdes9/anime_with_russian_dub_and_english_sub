        <pre>Evening
It's a memory of my father. He shines with happiness.
Well done. You sent your friends to hell, and you enjoy life yourself.
What are you trying to achieve? To finally open your eyes.
You realized how much Grisha JÃ¤ger brainwashed you.
And he put the seeds of nationalism in you.
We will continue to watch.
You did well. You completely forgot about your first family.
You enjoy a happy life.
And you don't care about anyone.
However, you had to forget that you already had a son.
Let's go.
Go on.
Look, Eren. This is his true face.
With the help of a doctor, he was entrusted with the trust of influential people.
He hoped to find the king of the walls and take the power of the titans from his parents.
If he had failed, his new family would have had a hard time.
He continued to put them in danger.
Do you understand why?
Because for the sake of the revival of the Ildian Empire,
this bastard was ready to sacrifice his wife and son.
I am disappointed.
How I was mistaken.
I shouldn't have been born.
Now I understand.
We have peace all the time.
We will not hurry.
Could it be that he was able to find them so quickly?
Where did he come?
To the fortress of the king of the walls.
But this is impossible.
Grisha was supposed to steal from his parents the day the wall fell.
A few years before that.

That's what I'm talking about.
It seems that his love for his second son
exceeded the desire to give birth to Aldia.
It seems that his love for his second son
exceeded the desire to give birth to Aldia.
Yes, everything was different with me.
He was able to draw conclusions from his mistakes.
However, everything you did was only for my father.
You stopped being yourself.
One day you will understand.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry, Zik.
Zik.
Zik?
Is that you?
Zik.
You're a fool.
Zik has to grow up a beard like this for a few more years.
It's just a dream.
What the hell?
I'll continue.
It's time to move on.
Zik.

Why did you decide to betray me?
My father didn't tell you anything.
He gave you Titan forcibly.
But you continue to fight as he wished.
Aaron, why do you persist in fighting?
You have the power over your parents.
How do you use it?
You know,
since I was born,
I've been myself.
Apparently, you thought we were the same.
But you're wrong.
If someone decides to take my freedom,
I'll do everything to pay them back.
Aaron,
do you realize what you've done?
Stop trying to find me.
I killed those bastards!
I've been myself since I was born.
Since I was born.
The brother you've been longing to find doesn't exist.
There's no one here who you could share your soul with.
And in front of me is a man
who's been fighting with me for a long time.
And in front of me is a man
who's been fighting with me for a long time
just because his father wanted it.
A miserable man who doesn't know how to assert himself.
In this case,
the man is grateful to his father.
After all, his actions have opened his son's eyes.
Now he will save the world from the threat of the Tullians.
In some sense, the world was saved by his father.
You can't find anything in Ismayer.
Aaron.
Listen, Aaron.
The power of the Titan is in my hands.
At any moment, I can start plans in Tonazio.
However, I will always protect you.
As Mr. Xavier protected me.
Before saving the world,
I have to understand how to save you.
Humanity was not destroyed.
It was destroyed.
Yes.
Interesting, he left a will.
We're home.
Come in.
Come on.
You did a good job today.
Yeah.
What for?
For lying.
Red ears were given out.
Did Mikasa help you?
Dad, are you leaving?
Work?
Yes.
We need to examine the patients.
It will take two or three days.
And Aaron wants to enter the intelligence corps.
Mikasa asked!
Aaron!
What are you thinking about?
Do you know how many died among those who came out of the walls?
Yes, I know!
So why?
Aaron!
Why do you want to go out?
I want to know what's going on in the outside world.
I'm sick of the thought that I'll have to sit behind the walls all my life.
Besides, if no one else wants to go out,
it's a waste of the sacrifice of the intelligence corps!
And here's how.
Leave soon.
I need to go.
Wait, dear.
Take Aaron away.
Carla, you're asking for the impossible.
No words will put out the fire of curiosity.
Aaron,
when I come back,
you and I will go down to the basement together.
Really?
Good luck!
I'm an Eldian who was born on the other side of the wall!
I'm the same as you are!
One of the descendants of the world!
Please, Your Highness!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Please, Your Highness!
Kill all the Titans who attack the walls!
Before my wife,
my children,
and all the inhabitants of the walls eat the monster!
For sins there is a payment.
This is a voluntary task.
Punishment for the people and the world.
A huge force is capable
of destroying even the best of us.
This is what I was taught by the tragedy of the Titan War.
The power of the Titans is absolute,
and it must be kept away from the hands of people.
If the power of the forefathers again falls into the hands of the unworthy,
the world will once again turn to hell.
In order to protect the world,
we must accept the punishment
and disappear from the face of the earth.
We found common ground with this girl.
But only all of them ran away and killed Grisha.
It seems you said you saw this memory.
And then you were disappointed in your father.
Was that also a lie?
My house is standing next to the destroyed wall!
Right next to it!
My family lives there, my wife, son and daughter!
Those who live inside the walls do not know about the sins
that our people have committed!
Because once your ancestor stole their memories!
They do not understand why the Titans are hunting them!
Do you think this is a scoop?
No.
We can argue with you to the end.
But the Eldians will never return the life
taken from other people.
However, if we all live within these walls,
there will be no new victims.
We must accept our fate,
accept the punishment of the whole world,
and let the Eldians die in blissful ignorance.
You may not try to convince me,
but even if you give me the progenitor of the Titans,
you will not be able to.
I know.
I will not be able to use the power of the progenitor.
Each of the nine has its own peculiarity.
I have an attacker, and he is no exception.
In the past, the successors of the attacker
did not obey any instructions.
And now I understand why.
In order to oppose the opinion of the kings!
Yes.
We all ended up here in the vast stream of memory.
And such a Titan can look into the memories
of his future successors.
And then...
he may find out what is coming.
He may find out what is coming.
And know what is coming.
What does it mean, Erna?
The peculiarity of the attacking Titan?
Impossible!
I also know that you did not know about it.
Even the royal family cannot use the power of the progenitor
because of the vow to refuse the war.
I will take care of the progenitor,
and I will protect the royal family.
This is the future that has been determined!
Run!
I can not.
I can not raise my hand on the children.
I am a doctor.
I have to save lives.
I do not believe it.
Grisha definitely stole the progenitor
and brutally killed the royal family.
He should have.
Could the past really change?
What are you doing, Frida?
Kill this bastard!
The progenitor is invincible!
Kill him!
Damn it!
He can not leave here alive!
You have to kill his sister!
Otherwise he will destroy the paradise for everyone!
Frida, protect everyone!
Sister!
Frida!
And what is this?
Get up, Father.
Did you forget why you came here?
You wanted to avenge the sister who was bitten by the dogs.
You wanted to avenge all your friends.
For Diana.
For Kruger.
For the revival of Eldia.
You wanted to avenge your sister.
For the revival of Eldia.
You wanted to get to the end.
Even if you die.
Even after death.
This is the story you wrote.
With your own hands.
With your own hands.
I killed them!
I crushed even small children!
With these hands!
Eren!
I killed the whole royal family!
Everyone except my father!
Now you are satisfied!
You wanted this!
You wanted this!
You wanted this!
You wanted this!
You wanted this!
You wanted this!
You wanted this!
Now Eldia can really be saved!
Why didn't you show me everything else?
How they broke the wall.
What happened next?
What happened to Carla?
Was there really no other way?
You are standing in front of me.
Zeke.
Your dream is not destined to come true.
Everything will be as Eren wants.
What are you talking about?
I saw the future memories of Eren.
I couldn't imagine that everything would turn out to be so terrible.
Zeke!
Is that really you?
How did you grow up?
I'm sorry.
I was a terrible father.
Because of me, you suffered so much.
Zeke!
Zeke!
I love you!
I wish I had more time to play games with you!
Zeke!
Father.
Zeke.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
This is the story of those who continued to fight despite all the difficulties and obstacles.
Who did this story begin with?
The next story will be about the people who have been fighting for a long time.
The story will be about the people who have been fighting for a long time.
The story will be about the people who have been fighting for a long time.
The story will be about the people who have been fighting for a long time.
The story will be about the people who have been fighting for a long time.
