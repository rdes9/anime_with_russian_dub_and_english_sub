        <pre>I don't think you're going to like what I'm going to tell you, but you should know, it happened three years ago, maybe in those days we could still change something.
Three years ago.
Commander, the front squad hasn't been in touch for more than two hours.
Hmm, get ready to land the second and third squad.
Yes, sir!
The demons of the island have overcome the warriors and now threaten the whole world. We need to gather information at any cost.
Hold on!
The devil!
Greetings, dear citizens of Marley! Welcome to Paradise Island!
My name is Hange. I'm here to meet our dear guests from distant lands.
Well, the road must have tired you, let's rest for a cup of tea.
By the way, your friend came to us a couple of hours earlier. We already had time to get along with him, didn't we, Nicolas?
Commander! Shoot these devilish scum!
What?
What did you find, Nicolas?
Commander!
He's clearly not going to play along with you.
Nicolas, remember, demons, Marley will never go to the water with the scum!
Our plans are not to drink your blood!
Huh? Huh? You understand that we were insulted, don't you?
The giant behind your back will not tolerate this!
You can't scare us with the devilish power! This is how you greet Marley!
What are you doing, Elena?
Drop your weapon.
What?
Don't hide.
Mrs. Hange, we are happy to receive your invitation.
Let's have some tea.
We finally met, Eren.
We finally met, Eren.
We finally met, Eren.
We finally met, Eren.
We finally met, Eren.
We finally met, Eren.
Volunteers.
This is Kalanchi. She shot her commander.
I wonder what's going on in her mind.
Who knows? We definitely shouldn't trust this woman.
Sasha, don't sleep.
And still, we can get at least some information from them.
We were very lucky.
Yeah, real luck.
We accidentally noticed their arrival.
If they take us seriously, the situation will be different.
We need a plan.
Oh, I see. He can shoot several times in a row.
And this is Marley's standard equipment.
Marley's soldiers are divided into divisions of 20,000 people.
There are only 50 divisions, that is, about a million soldiers.
And in addition to the army, they have three fleets of 21 ships in each.
In addition, they are developing new weapons, including the air fleet.
Air fleet?
Less emotions, or they'll just take it.
I know.
In short, this is a transport that carries enemies through the sky.
What? They're moving through the sky?
Quiet!
Marley is ahead of us in all possible ways.
But for a whole year they didn't even try to attack.
Why?
There are two main reasons.
First, these are pure giants that they themselves launched to the island.
It's not easy to deal with them, even with the latest weapons.
Initially, with their help, Marley wanted to drive the Eldians behind the walls.
But it so happened that the giants became the shield of the Eldians.
What an irony.
However, it is already dawn.
The giants should wake up soon.
And we sit outside the walls and drink tea as if nothing had happened.
So there are no pure giants left on the island.
My guess is right.
Well, what now?
Will you report to Marley soon?
No, I just didn't expect you to be so strong.
What's the second reason?
At the moment, Marley is at war with several countries.
And I have no time to deal with the island.
All because you overcame the great Marley warriors.
You deprived them of the main weapon by taking the colossal female oesope.
Marley has a lot of enemies,
so the countries quickly united and went to the Marley warriors in war.
And you, out of the ruined countries, want to take revenge on Marley.
That's why they decided to join the army and spy on the enemy.
Oh?
Did you guess?
It's clear that the Marley warriors need strong reasons and a reliable rear.
In fact, it's hard to call us spies.
The Marley warriors deprived us of our homeland.
We had no choice and we entered their ranks.
We had no idea how to fight with a huge power.
Until he sent us.
The Marley warriors and the whole world consider this giant a demon.
But for me, he came from another world.
He was God.
At the hour of despair, he gave us hope.
Our people killed their commanders at the order of Zika Jäger.
We are volunteers in the fight against Marley.
And our goal is to free the Lydian people.
So are the demands of Zika Jäger.
All his actions are aimed exclusively at the liberation of the Lydian...
Bullshit!
We won't sign such a thing!
It's all superstitious!
He turned to the inhabitants of the Raghaks-gigants and sat in the house inside the walls!
This man barely destroyed the legion of scouts.
Who will listen to him?
Their main goal was and remains the return of the giant-founder.
If the power failed, now they are trying to trick us.
They know that we think so.
Maybe we should first listen to the commander's version.
If we believe in Zika, then his secret plan will solve all the problems of the Lydians.
To bring this plan into action, we need two giants.
The founder and the giant with the royal blood.
With them, we will save the whole world.
However, he will reveal the plan himself when the requirements are met.
Bullshit!
This bastard keeps us for idiots.
Eren.
He's telling the truth.
I remembered.
The power of the founder.
I managed to take advantage of it only once.
At that moment, I touched the giant with the royal blood.
That giant was Dina Fritz.
My father's ex-wife.
Dina's son must have figured out how to get around the curse of the world.
For us, the Lydians, this is the last hope.
This is the key to the awakening of a thousand giants sleeping inside the walls.
The key to the activation of Gula.
Hey.
Why didn't you tell me about this before?
I was afraid of the life of history.
I didn't want her to be turned into a giant.
Because of my guess.
I admit that I was wrong about you.
We'll discuss this later.
Then, if the language doesn't lie to us,
there's a point in his plan and truth.
Are you crazy?
Do you want to trust them?
Exactly.
How can we let the enemy troops walk on our land?
It's better to kill them all.
No.
You can't do that.
If we want to protect ourselves from the Marley intelligence ships,
we need these volunteers.
If they don't get in touch...
This is Investigator One speaking.
Can you hear me?
This is Investigator One speaking.
This is Investigator Two speaking.
Finally.
Our ship has landed.
All hope is on you.
We're moving out.
Are you in that bay?
How many of you are there?
Calm down.
Two ships are coming to you.
Hey!
You're safe!
We'll help you!
It's huge!
Where from?
Hey!
It's the enemy!
Hurry up!
This way!
Run!
All aboard!
Welcome to the cursed island of the evil devils.
Be like at home.
But instead of tea, we have urine.
We don't insist, but then we'll have to swim.
The way to home is not close.
We had a good time.
Yes, we are Eldians.
We are afraid and hated all over the world.
We are even afraid of those who have never seen us.
But it turned out that not only our enemies live on the other side of the ocean.
We realized that the world is more complicated than it seemed to us.
It's full of unexplored things.
An Yankabon, why is your skin so dark?
I believe that our creator decided that the more people there are, the better.
Just like the people and the world, we exist because someone wanted it so much.
And who created us all?
The one who gave power to the Mother of God and the world.
God.
That's what some people think.
Everyone has the right to believe in something.
What kind of food is this?
Is it edible at all?
It smells like fish.
Is it your first time seeing sea food?
Nikola is a real guru of Marley cuisine.
Damn, I don't like it. Don't eat, Eldians.
As if I want to cook for you.
Delicious!
Hey!
It's easier, Sasha!
Nikola, you're a real genius!
Don't act like an animal.
I've never eaten anything tastier in my life.
There's a lot of food, chew it at least.
The port is almost complete.
Thanks to the help of the Marley engineers, the port has been completed.
The construction is moving very fast.
It's surprising that it doesn't help.
At first, we were really dangerous to each other.
However, as time went by, we got used to each other and looked at each other.
And found common language.
Armin, have you seen anything in Bertold's memory?
Well, yes, but there's nothing interesting.
Time is running out.
Zika has only three years left.
Yes, I thought about it.
I'm sure we should follow Elena's plan.
What's wrong with them?
And we definitely need to scare the world with a ghoul.
What if there's some other way?
After all, we will really become devils for the whole world.
And what if we can agree to convince Marley and other countries?
Are we mistaken?
Mistaken?
What else is mistaken?
Well, that we are scary and all that.
For the whole world, we are monsters capable of becoming giants.
This is not a mistake.
But some Marley people are friends with us.
There are few of them.
Most of their soldiers are still sitting behind the bars and scratching their teeth.
With time, it can change.
Yes, we need time.
Exactly.
And to win this time, we must tie our hands to the enemies.
I'm not sure if we did the right thing then.
And what if there was some other way?
This thought doesn't give me peace.
I thought I understood Eren as someone else.
Even better than Mikasa.
But now I'm not sure about that.
Hey!
You're a Marley!
Tell me, why did you come here?
This is your killed Aldica, who is buried here.
Stop!
Let him go!
We'll figure it out ourselves!
Please, let's not do it here.
There's nothing to be afraid of here.
Hey, Nikola!
Are you alive?
Damn!
How could this be?
Sasha is really dead.
Sasha is really dead.
Tell me.
How?
How did you let this happen?
She was shot by a girl who was buried in Derejabl.
What a ridiculous death.
It was an unusual girl.
She's a soldier.
A war candidate.
I've lost my mind.
I'm sorry.
No need to apologize.
I was just cooking for you.
Thank you.
Thanks to you, she ate a lot of delicious things, Nikola.
And Santa, how are you?
Horses.
Sasha and I were like twins.
They tore a piece from me.
That's...
Thank you for taking care of my daughter.
I'm sorry.
I'm just a prisoner of the Marleyts.
But I'm allowed to work as a cook.
And your daughter...
...loved my dishes like no one else.
So...
...if you don't mind...
...I invite you to dinner.
I hope you won't take the money.
Of course.
Dinner.
So you announced your victory.
There's nothing worse than living in ignorance.
If we reveal your betrayal...
...and send your body to the Marleyts...
...your old men will be dead.
However, if you really have a plan...
...I'm ready to postpone your execution.
I don't care when you die.
I sincerely appreciate your generosity.
But first, I'd like to meet with Seren.
What's the rush?
I've got a great hotel room for you.
So we'll let you rest first.
Listen, stop staring at me.
We've stolen the Marleyts giant's jewelry.
We can't get any more.
However, there will be problems with the production.
It's okay.
It's more than enough for us.
To be honest, I don't know how to thank you.
We owe you.
You opened our eyes and gave us hope.
Only a real demon can doubt our intentions.
It seemed to us...
...that in these three years we were able to prove our loyalty to the Marleyts.
It's a pity.
After all, we brought you this weapon...
...so that it would bring the Marleyts freedom.
It may sound selfish...
...but I ask you to understand our weakness.
We are forced to limit the freedom of Zika.
It's okay, Commander Pixis.
Soon there will be a day when we will sit at the back table again.
So this is my hotel?
You don't like it, do you?
A giant forest.
It's like a home for you.
It looks like UPM is a good place to stay.
By the way, Captain Levy...
...maybe Gabi and Falco will show us this wonderful reserve?
It's up to you to see if the Marleyts can enjoy the views.
Eren...
...Eger!
Eren was ready to act alone.
Whether we help him or not...
...he wouldn't have come this far.
And as a result...
...many people died.
We killed soldiers and civilians with our own hands.
In one moment they lost everything.
However...
...if their military port survived...
...the Marley army would immediately strike back.
There is no hope for peace.
But...
...we had no choice...
...just like you had that day.
Hey...
...Annie...
...say something.
Courage and death.
Victory.
Life.
There is no war without it, Captain.
Fight.
Fight!
