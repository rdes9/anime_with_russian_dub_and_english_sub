        <pre>Chapter 4
I heard Erin's voice!
My name is...
Eren Yeager, with the help of the power of the progenitor titan, I turn to all the people and the world.
From all the walls in Paradis, stones were scattered, and all the titans that were hidden in them began to come out.
My goal is to protect people, the island of Paradis, where I was born and raised.
But the world wishes for the death of the people of Paradis and will not stop until all the people and the world are destroyed on the island and beyond its borders.
I reject this desire.
At the end of the line, the titans from the walls will fly across all the lands to the other side of the sea.
And their inhabitants will be destroyed forever.
I reject this desire.
I reject this desire.
To be continued...
What was that? I suddenly felt like I didn't know where I was.
How are you, Leonhart?
Did you also hear?
From that island, the titans are coming to kill us all.
Falco!
Falco! Where are you?
Where did you go?
After the first transformation into a titan, the memory is like in a fog, and you can't move right away.
They kidnapped him.
Tarani! Why?
I'm sure they didn't.
They would never let go of such an important prisoner.
One of the nine titans can't just be left like that.
Reiner! Don't you have any strength left?
The armor fell off for some reason, and the broken walls hit right on the body.
I couldn't stop him.
Eren will destroy the world.
In the south, there is a garrison waiting for retreat.
Find Piccoli Marliztsev and run to him.
Tell him that Marley is not in the world.
What's the point of telling him?
What's the point of telling him?
Marley is not in the world.
What's the point of telling him?
Where do we run to?
Mom, Dad, and Aunt Karina, they're all going to die.
Yes.
We have to kill Eren and stop the titans.
It won't work.
A titan can control all titans, the people, and the world at will.
Now we can't stop him.
All we can do is run.
Reiner!
I won't give up so easily.
Wait for me, Falco.
This is the end.
Who knew that he was going to break through all humanity beyond the walls.
But if they all die, all their hatred will disappear.
All the enemies that threatened our survival will turn into a cake.
Only the bare earth will remain.
Something happened that the people were most afraid of on the other side of the wall.
They called us devils and dreamed of killing everyone.
That is, they were the ones who brought this outcome to the world.
We couldn't have affected him.
Right?
But...
Still...
This is an obvious outburst of an unprecedented battle.
Then...
Let's stop Eren.
He is...
He is...
Eren...
He is...
He rejected Zika, who wanted to castrate a merciful death on his plan.
And he refused to sacrifice history to preserve the power of the progenitor.
Otherwise...
Eren...
He sacrificed humanity beyond the walls for our sake.
Eren...
For the benefit of this bloody bath...
We will shoulder it.
Because I will fight you more than anyone else.
What is that?
Titans?
They are fighting our soldiers?
And they have already eaten all the Marleyians?
How so?
If Eren controls the progenitor, then all the titans must be in his power.
But they are going after us!
We are going to help them!
Wait, Jean!
What should we do with the boy?
Most likely, he inherited the toothed titan.
We can't let the boy go.
We can save one of the turned into titans.
If we feed him.
For example?
To Commander Pixis.
To my mother.
If we feed my mother to the enemy.
Is there any objection?
Koni! Jean!
According to Zika, he is a candidate for the war.
He is like a younger brother to Reiner's detachment.
If we kill a dear friend of Reiner's,
then we will start a new fight with Reiner and the titan transporter.
If the Marleyians are already dead,
then Reiner's detachment and we have no reason to kill each other.
So...
Do you want to say that you don't care about my mother?
Not at all.
Do you even understand what thoughts I came home with?
Where is my mother in this form?
You ate Bertoldo and came back to life.
So don't interfere with my attempt to save my mother!
Hey!
Koni!
Later!
It's a mess.
We need to deal with the titans.
There are no more walls on the island.
Damn, they destroyed the citadel.
The soldiers outside have already been killed.
Yelena!
Back off!
Zika has already created these titans.
Why?
He doesn't control them anymore.
They broke through!
That's it, we're done.
Run!
Let's hide in the narrow alley!
Kaya, look forward!
Kaya!
Stop, Mr. Blaus!
Why?
Again?
Help!
Sister!
Kaya!
Kaya!
Get up!
Sister?
Son?
I heard you ran away with the soldiers.
How did you get here?
I'm going to save Falco from the clans.
Yes, Bunya.
Hey!
Are you all alive?
And you killed this titan?
What kind of weapon is this?
Did the girl shoot?
Could it be...
This is the Alasutian Cizl?
I'll show you.
I'll show you.
I'll show you.
I'll show you.
I'll show you.
I'll show you.
I'll show you.
I'll show you.
I'll show you.
Is this the Alasutian from Marley?
Answer me!
Otherwise...
It's not us!
We're a family and we live together on a horse farm!
Kaya...
I killed the titan!
I'm a former Marley prisoner!
I can shoot!
It's good to accuse.
It's better to take us to a safe place.
Help, soldiers!
Please take us away from here!
Help us!
Don't leave us!
Save us from the titans!
Please!
All right!
Let's go!
Let's get out of the fire!
Listen, Mia.
You'll run away with Ben.
But until then, be calm and come with us.
All right.
Did you also see that dream of his?
Yes!
The titans and the walls are true!
They went to trample the world?
Yes.
It looks like it.
Why did you lock me up?
And you yourself?
Why did you save me?
And risk your life?
I don't know.
I tried to kill you.
I'm a devil, aren't I?
No.
I'm the devil.
I killed a lot of people.
Just for the sake of praise.
Look at me.
I'm the devil.
The devil is inside of me.
And inside of Kai.
And inside of Kai.
And inside of any other.
There's a devil inside of every person.
That's why the world became like that.
Then what should we do, Ima?
Get out of the forest.
And if it doesn't work,
then try again and again.
Help me!
Surma!
I don't remember that I taught you how to meet the titans.
Stand and shiver from fear.
Zewa, put on the gears.
The old equipment is still left.
And then everyone follow me.
If someone wants to live, of course.
Instructor Shadis.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Do you remember me?
Shadis.
Is anybody alive here?
Everyone go upstairs to the citadel.
Let's bring there titans and beat them.
Let's Cainen out all the smoke,
Let the titans go to another place!
If the dear comrades who were made titans,
then let them all rest here!
All together!
FIRE!
FIRE!
They're coming!
Let's go!
This way!
You don't have to fight!
Just lead them to the Tatarelle!
FIRE!
Commander Pixis!
Come on!
Commander!
We managed to achieve everything!
Only thanks to you!
Come...
...to the world!
FIRE!
FIRE!
It seems that the fire has subsided.
And almost all the Marlites have died.
And there are no more pure titans.
So far, there is nothing to be afraid of.
I see.
Maybe now...
...tell us about your dream.
Aaron...
...what did he do?
You see for yourself.
I see.
And my homeland...
...is doomed too.
Look!
Are you all right?
I see.
While I was dying under the walls...
...you were commanding the destruction of the titans, Jeanne.
So you're alive.
Yes.
Thank you for your concern.
I can't breathe right now.
After all, the Ildian Empire is being reborn in our eyes.
Elena...
Calm down, volunteers.
You're all under arrest.
What?
I'm glad you're all right, Mr. Blaus.
And I'm glad you're all alive.
I'm sorry I called you at such a time.
It's you!
Where are you from?
Believe me...
...I won't fight with you anymore.
I just...
...want to bring Falco back.
And then you won't see us anymore.
Where is...
...Falco?
Oh no!
He was kidnapped to feed the mother...
...who was turned into a titan?
How could that be?
Mom, Coney...
...was the only one who couldn't move, so she wasn't touched.
All four years...
...Coney was watching over her tirelessly.
Four years ago?
Four years ago?
I'm sorry...
...me...
...but I still...
...can't leave Falco.
Tell me...
...couldn't Eren Yeager turn mom into a horse?
Because the titans were born by force!
I don't know.
But if he could...
...I think he would turn Eren into a soldier...
...who made the titans out of him.
If you don't know...
...then ask Eren himself!
Why do you have to kill all the people...
...outside the island?
Because you can't do without it!
Why can't you destroy only military bases...
...all over the world?
Ask him!
Because he lost Reiner and Bronn...
...that means he can do something!
Where is Reiner?
What difference does it make?
He's wounded, he can't get up!
Eren removed the statement of the armored titan?
When?
At what point?
When the walls collapsed.
Armin...
Eren meant...
...that the stones fell...
...from all the titans.

The frozen time has resumed.
And everything has changed.
At this moment, we must make a choice.
Next.
Borg's sunset.
