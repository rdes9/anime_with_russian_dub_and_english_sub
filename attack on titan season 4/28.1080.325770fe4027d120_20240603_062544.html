        <pre>Everyone says that Eren has changed. I thought so, too. But maybe that's not the case.
Eren hasn't changed at all.
What if he was always like this?
What have I seen in Eren all these years?
There are cities beyond the walls, and people live in them.
Stop talking about walls to strangers.
Yes, I know.
Here is the Motherland beyond the walls.
And we are the first inhabitants of the world beyond the walls who step on the walls in that direction.
I just told you to shut up!
I can say that this is part of the work that we have been doing since the very beginning.
Let's start the investigation.
Friends, welcome to the Motherland beyond the walls.
Allow me to take you to the place of the Lord.
Thank you.
The Motherland beyond the walls
Friends, welcome to the Motherland beyond the walls.
Allow me to take you to the place of the Lord.
Thank you.
I am so glad that you have arrived safely.
Well, what do you think? This is the largest coastal town in Marley.
That's a horse! It's a horse, isn't it?
Maybe it's a bull.
It's a car. They told me about them before they arrived.
Hey! A car!
It's bad. They're all looking at us.
Yes, we are now definitely the villagers.
Let's pretend we don't know them.
Hey! A car!
If we don't stop them, they'll try to feed a pile of iron with carrots.
Well, that's unlikely.
They're buying carrots!
There are so many people here.
Hey, Aaron, you can wait here for anything.
You'd better stay away from me.
Aaron.
All right.
Why are you flying in the clouds, Aaron?
We're in the outer world.
Yes.
We're on the other side of the sea.
Exactly.
Hey, don't go away.
Especially you.
We're coming!
Watch out, Skid!
This one?
Here you go.
Of course.
Here you go.
Hey, Sasha, you're up to your own again.
Give me a bite.
It's my first time trying ice cream.
That's it!
Let me try it too. And me.
What are they doing?
And they said we didn't stand out.
Oh, come on.
Oh, come on.
Oh, come on.
You try it too!
Oh, boy.
You want some ice cream?
I'm for you.
You're all set.
Go and play some gangster games.
It smells good from there.
That's probably what Nicola was talking about.
Three more.
Of course.
Aaron,
you try it too.
Ice cream?
You know...
I just saw it in my father's memories.
It's a rare treat for the Eldians in the ghetto.
The world behind the walls is so big.
We didn't notice it.
Maybe...
we didn't want to notice it.
Hey.
That's not your wallet.
Pocketer!
He's an immigrant from the enemy country!
How did you get in here?
You must've been a hare.
He doesn't even understand us.
Let's throw him out into the sea.
We'll break his right hand
so he won't be able to steal anymore.
We'll tie him up and hang him in a visible place
so that the others don't see it.
That way, we'll get rid of him.
What are you doing?
That's too much.
My wallet is safe and sound.
It's none of your business, girl.
You have to punish him in advance.
It's our business,
those who make a living here.
Let him be from the people and the world.
In recent years,
all the countries have been doing blood tests.
What if the devil's blood gets into us?
Then we won't be able to sleep peacefully.
Hey!
What are you doing?
Who said he was a pocket man?
I just said it wasn't his wallet.
The small one took the older sister's wallet.
Yeah!
It's very difficult to live with a family,
isn't it, little sister?
Yeah!
I'm sorry, brother.
Enough talking!
We believed you.
Let's go.
Stop!
Where did that guy go?
He's over there.
But
it's still Tatsumaki's pocket money.
I'm sorry,
but
I don't think
he's a pocket man.
I'm sorry you had to go through this.
Indeed,
with the development of the blood test technology,
people from the people and the world started to be found all over the world,
who fled from the ghetto,
which became a big problem.
Earlier, when the Eldian Empire was at its peak,
for the upper classes of the world society,
blood mixing with the people and the world
was considered a sign of special need.
But now,
with the decline of the Empire,
it has led to the fact
that they have become extinct in their countries.
So,
the reality of the Eldians is beyond the walls.
I have to say
that for the implementation of the current plan,
the paradigm will be extremely difficult
for the friendship of other countries.
But anyway,
if we leave the peaceful path,
we will have to join the Zagavruzik.
We will have to entrust our destinies to him
and sacrifice history with its future children.
Yes.
Of course, we are here to avoid such a future.
Tomorrow, at the symposium between the people,
the People's Committee on the Protection of the People and the World
will be presented for the first time.
We will judge by it.
But, as before,
the ideology of this movement
is not clear to us.
Yes.
First, we need to carefully assess everything.
And then,
if we manage to organize
a face-to-face meeting with them,
you will be able to let them know
that the Paradise Island wants peace.
Yes.
Of course,
we, the people of Zumabit,
will do everything in our power
to make such an important decision.
However,
how realistic do you think this plan is?
We understand
that it will be very difficult
and very dangerous.
However,
that is why
we must do absolutely everything we can.
As you wish.
Aaron,
where is he?
Aaron,
do you understand
that you are the most important person
and the most important goal
for our enemies now?
Everyone was looking for you.
The boy from the market?
Did something happen?
Nothing yet.
What are you talking about?
What kind of place is this?
The camp where people who lost their homes
because of the war live.
We were the same.
One day,
our life suddenly collapsed
and we were deprived of everything.
Just like we were deprived
of all freedom.
Mikasa,
why do you
care so much about me?
Is it because
I saved you in childhood
or
because I am your family?
What do I
mean to you?
You are
my family.
Lisa,
Nari,
looks like he is inviting you.
Hey!
What are you doing there,
Aaron?
Are you out of your mind?
Just in time.
Nari!
THE END
We are here to support the refugees
from the people and the world
that are scattered all over the country.
These refugees
have never been the Eldians
and are not part of the dangerous ideology
of the Eldian Empire.
They are just
the miserable victims
that the Eldian Empire
forced to die.
As before,
our hatred is only deserved
by the island devils.
Our enemies
are the devils of this island.
From that day,
Aaron left us.
Since then,
the letters he sent
told us
that he would entrust everything to Zika.
And the next time we saw each other,
it was too late.
Could it be
that we had a choice to make?
Or was everything decided
from the very beginning?
Sometimes I think about it.
What if
I had chosen
the right answer
from the beginning?
What if the result
was different?
What did it all start with?
With what?
No.
It doesn't matter what.
Everything was as I wished.
And everything
is still ahead.
Aaron,
the only way to save both the world and the idea
is the plan of a merciful death.
We must bring it to an end.
Only the highest commandment
that can hinder the revolution
will be drunk
with the wine with brain fluid.
Zika trusts you.
Trust him, too.
I
will follow Zika's plan,
but only for the sake of the view.
You do the same.
But how can the court's subordinates
help us?
The guards have already begun to carry out their plan.
They want to turn you into a titan
and feed you with Zika's arrival.
We have only two options.
Either to fight or to run away.
All this time,
I didn't just watch the cows.
I know
there is no need to fight or run away.
If there is the most reliable way
to save the island,
I will follow Zika.
There was no other option.
But at that moment,
you stood up for my protection.
Everyone was asking for help.
It was enough for me.
Maybe you have no opinion.
What?
I will destroy the world.
I will wipe the enemies off the face of the earth.
I will destroy
all of them
for one.
This is wrong.
This is wrong.
Not all people outside the island
are our enemies.
Almost everyone there is like your mother.
People
who die for no reason.
I know.
But
there is only one way
to break the cycle of hatred and revenge.
It is to completely erase
the history of hatred
with civilization.
They want you to give birth
to the victims of the island
and feed the children of their parents.
I will not let that happen.
But I...
Aaron, if I don't do everything
to stop you,
I will never
be able to
be proud of myself.
If it is hard for you,
I will change your memories
and let you live in peace.
I can't.
You can.
Because you saved me
at that moment.
You are the worst girl in the world.
Headache?
Is it a special disease
typical of the Ackerman family?
No.
There are no taxes.
I didn't hear anything like that.
However, according to the records,
there were many cases
of distinct survival.
A habit
to protect the owner?
There is hardly anything like that.
In general, it seems to me...
Listen, Aaron,
she is not at all
used to a secret plan
or some kind of compulsion.
And since she is ready
to turn the titan's head for you,
then she is simply in love with you.
Then, Aaron...
Well?
What will you say?
What are you talking about, brother?
I have to live
for a maximum of four years.
What will you say
if I give birth to a child?
I want their lives
to continue after my death.
I want them to live
for a long time.
Live long
and happily.
The fleet of the Northern Coalition,
almost all the largest-caliber cannons
that exist in the world,
are now gathered here.
All human beings
are busy aiming at the same goal.
To assemble this fleet,
a miracle was required.
If it fails,
then there is no other way
for humanity to influence its destiny
and stop the voice of the Earth.
