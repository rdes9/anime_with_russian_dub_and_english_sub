        <pre>Four years we spent to capture this peninsula, and with the destruction of the enemy fleet, we barely lost two of the nine giants.
The ingenuity of mankind was finally able to destroy the armor of the giants of Marley.
The news spread around the world and the Middle Eastern Alliance rests on the laurels.
It doesn't look like the great victory of the Marley people.
Magat, do you have anything to say?
Marshal, this moment has come. The power of the giants for mankind is no longer a threat.
While we used the power of the giants and continued colonial expansion, other countries tried to develop new weapons against us.
In the end, our strategy went sideways.
With the current situation, our giants are still not equal in ground battles.
However, if the development of aviation does not reduce the pace, bombs will fall on our heads.
The giants are considered to be the demons of the earth, they will only have to scratch their heads and watch.
Do we have a case of a giant with wings?
Marshal, I'm just trying to say that the era of giants ...
I understand you. In the near future, we will lose our advantage in war.
No, most likely we have already lost.
After all, it was we who crushed the Eldian demons, and now they themselves are like them.
May I speak, Marshal? Let me express my opinion.
Miracle, boy Zik, go ahead.
We need to resume the operation on the island of Paradis and return the giants of the Founder.
Commander Magat is absolutely right.
Marley needs to start developing new weapons as soon as possible.
However, the rest of the countries will not stand still.
Our army will need time to fully rearm.
In our interests, it is possible to capture Paradis as soon as possible.
When Marley gets the power of all the giants, the newspapers of the whole world will write about it.
As far as I remember, you have one year left.
Yes, and I'm not sure that Colt will be able to inherit all the power of a beastly giant.
I see. And the last year you want to spend to fix the mistake of four years ago?
That's exactly right.
All our troubles began with the crazy outbursts of Grisha and Jäger.
He is my father, and I am responsible for his actions.
THE END
Episode 2 The Night Train
I'm sorry, Colt. Did I put you in the wrong place?
No, you are amazing.
The Marshal decided to listen to the Council of the Eldians.
Not a single beast could control other giants.
Everything is like in the legends about the Giant of the Founder.
What makes you so special among us?
You are like a carrier of the Queen's blood.
How should I know? I'm afraid I'll die before I know what's going on.
Oh, and you will inherit my memories one day.
You will learn my secret.
Secret? What secret?
A secret way to wipe your ass.
Keep it a secret.
Well, no, report everything.
Commander!
Until the hair falls on the ass.
Do the Eldians have the right to private life?
Do you think you can capture Paradis in a year?
I don't know if I can, but I don't have much time to think.
In the last three years, not a single reconnaissance ship has returned from Paradis Island.
Zik, why do you think so?
We sent 32 ships for reconnaissance.
I doubt one giant could capture Paradis in a year.
The ship?
I doubt one giant could handle them.
I think Erno Jäger helped someone else.
At least they have one more giant.
I think so too.
If we're going to attack the island, we need a serious fleet.
Yes, but the giants are not the only thing they have.
Stop!
I thought you had a pleasant dream.
That's why I didn't wake you up.
I never thanked you that time, Goliath.
You saved me.
Don't bother.
If I got the armored guy nine years ago, it wouldn't have happened at all.
And my brother would be alive if he didn't have to save you from the giant.
Did you see Marseille's memories?
No.
But I learned a lot from the memories of the world.
It's hard to bear such a name.
Poor girl.
She agreed to give us back our jaw at her own will, didn't she?
Yes, at her own will.
So what were you doing there?
You just did what you could to save your ass?
Yes.
In her memories, I saw how you behaved.
Oh, come on.
You got the image of a reliable guy.
My brother must have copied him.
Pocko!
Don't press on a man who caught the core with his face.
Stop calling me that, pig.
What about you?
I was in the shape of a giant for two months in a row.
I managed to forget how to walk on two legs.
By the way, Reiner,
Gabby and the guys are worried about you.
Visit them.
I was just about to.
I'm tired.
It's like we haven't seen each other forever.
Really?
We've been fighting all the time.
Exactly.
I wish I could rest from the war.
That would be nice.
This way.
Uh-huh.
Guys, what if the giants become useless in the battles?
What will happen to us?
And what will happen to all the Jews?
Mr. Brown will get better.
I know.
Hey, look.
These are the enemies.
Those soldiers who survived the attack of the pure giants.
When they get home,
they'll start talking about the cruelty of war with the giants.
Hatred for the Jews will only grow.
The whole world will unite and destroy the children and the world.
Damn it, damn it, damn it!
Be quiet, fool.
Don't destroy the city.
Reiner!
Can you walk already?
Yeah.
Are you all right?
Gabby?
Uh-huh.
Udo?
I think so.
Sofia?
As always.
Falco?
Yeah.
I heard.
We're going back to Liberia soon.
In the meantime, we can go for a walk.
It's easier.
Such a rare chance.
Doesn't Mr. Brown need a break?
Don't worry.
I can handle it.
Go have a rest yourself.
Hey, I'm with you.
Gabby, wait.
Commander Magat said that children can't go there.
I saw him go there himself.
Don't be afraid.
Wait.
Huh?
It's too early for you to go there.
I hope you all saw her.
She was found by the Haldian goddess, the brave Gabby.
Gabby sent a single ship to save 800 Haldian soldiers.
Enough, Colt.
You overreacted.
Do you realize how dangerous it was for them?
Comrades!
Do you know why she risked her life?
I know.
She did it to save our weak Haldian asses.
Hurray!
We need to calm them down.
Leave them alone.
At least for now.
Gabby! Gabby! Gabby!
She's shaking again.
You can't drink to my brother at all.
Gabby is too light to lift.
In the end, everything goes to the fact that Gabby is the one who inherits the armored one.
Yes.
The girl who admires you inherits your strength and will die at the age of 27.
If the gun doesn't blow her head off before that,
does it satisfy you?
What kind of talk is this?
You insulted the honor of inheriting the strength of one of the nine?
If I report this,
you and your whole family will be turned into pure giants.
Wait!
Let me rephrase.
I am a candidate for the war, Falco Grice.
I hope to get rid of the blood and the peace of my ancestors.
I dedicate my life to Marley.
And what about the honor of inheriting the strength of one of the nine?
I will be glad to become an honorable Marleyman
and get the opportunity to demonstrate loyalty to our homeland.
Do you want to inherit the armored one?
Thank you!
I will be the next heir to the armored one!
Okay.
You have to save Gabby.
Don't let her split my fate.
We're home!
We're back alive!
Our home!
Our beloved home, Liberio!
We're back!
Gabby,
be a little quieter.
You know you can't drink.
Who let him drink alcohol?
How could I refuse him?
So here it is.
This kindness of the peak spread all over the train.
We had to make use of them.
Did you hear them shaking you in your arms?
It's a cult!
What is it?
Did you deserve the praise?
After all, you did a feat.
Peak!
Commander Brown's castle.
What if we look alike?
What if he also thinks that the Eldians are not obliged to fight?
But can we trust him?
Come on.
Try to have time to rest.
There's no time.
There will be training tomorrow.
Since when are you so stubborn?
You decided to sneak up on me?
Nothing like that.
Guys,
don't strain yourself like that.
Dad!
Zik!
Grandpa!
Grandma!
I'm back!
You've done well.
No,
that's not enough.
Colt!
Falko!
Colt!
Dad!
Mom!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Mom!
Gabi!
Rainer!
You must be tired.
Come on, let's go home.
Mom,
I'll do it with joy.
I'll catch up with you!
What's wrong with you?
Are you out of your mind?
Mr. Kosla,
what's wrong?
Are you hurt?
Yeah,
you'd better step back,
little one.
It's a lie with emotional trauma.
Is it the same with ours?
If you keep digging trenches
and hanging from the rubble,
at the end of the day,
the roof will go.
That's it.
Bam!
Look,
they can't hold their legs again.
Calm down,
you're safe.
Your bandage is not on that hand.
Don't worry,
I'm sure you'll get better.
You won't have to fight anymore.
Bam!
As planned!
The armored train blew up
and got off the rails.
It fell right on the dot.
But while I was running,
they opened fire from the machine gun on me.
I've already begun to make life easier.
But then Goliath jumped on his giant
and protected me.
It's a miracle, Gabby.
My brave daughter
saved a bunch of soldiers.
You're our savior, L.D.
I'm proud of you, baby.
Reiner,
do you think Gabby will become a warrior?
Yeah,
most likely an armored giant.
Gabby is his heir.
Nice to hear.
There will be two warriors in our family.
It's such a honor.
I wish these orphans
would just disappear from the island.
Then the L.D.s
would finally be happy.
By the way, Reiner,
seeing these monsters,
I had to run away even for you.
Stop it, father!
He had to survive on the island
among these demons for five years.
Even if it was possible,
he still didn't want to
talk about it.
That's true.
You, nephew,
didn't think about it?
No.
I can tell you something.
I managed to get into their army.
They were all crazy,
heartless savages.
At the ceremony,
one of them started eating potatoes.
The instructor yelled at her,
but she didn't care.
She just wanted it and stole it.
She suggested
giving half of the potatoes
to bribe him.
However,
there wasn't even half of it.
They didn't hear
about the feeling at all.
All hopeless idiots.
One of them
even forgot
why he went to the toilet.
The other one
only thought about himself.
There was one who only thought about others.
One idiot
always got into trouble,
and the other two
followed him everywhere.
There was no one there.
We had to live with him.
It was
a real hell.
I think I talked too much.
Forget it.
There are so many different people
and they're all evil.
Evil, Gabby.
These scoundrels from the island
want to destroy our world.
At any moment,
they can let the giants out of the walls
and they will trample the whole world.
And good Eldians
must stop them no matter what.
Those who left us
and ran to the island
deserve punishment.
After all,
they abandoned us.
What is it, Gabby?
What are you thinking about?
Aunt Karina is worried about you.
She says you've changed
since you came back
from the island.
Her 12-year-old son
came back as an adult man.
It's not easy to accept that.
It's as if you don't agree.
Really?
So what?
I can't understand myself.
But Aunt Karina knows for sure.
It looks like he was a soldier.
What a horror.
Good morning.
Now we're all together.
What an event.
We often gather in the commander's office.
And where is the management?
They are not in this room.
You can at least drink tea
without them.
Yes.
So, the last battle
made it clear that in the near future
the usual weapons of people
will surpass the power of giants.
The weaker Marley,
the more danger
the Jewish race is facing.
Our existence is under threat.
To fix the situation,
Marley needs a giant-founder
and the resources of Paradise Island.
First of all,
we need to remind the world
what kind of threat the island is.
And we need the one
who will tell this story.
The Tiber family will play this role.
The family that owns
the giant hammer?
The Tiber family never used
the giant hammer on the enemy territory.
All over the world
they are known for expelling
King Fritz during the great war
of giants.
Their word weighs a lot.
Right in the apple of your eye.
That's right.
But the Tiber live in their luxurious
mansions.
Why did they suddenly
enter the game and portray the heroes?
I understand your feelings.
But the Tiber also worry
about Marley.
But they...
If you save our homeland,
I will be only glad.
Our warriors will unite with the Tiber.
And this will allow them to restore
the power of Marley.
Right.
By the way, a festival will be held
here in Liberia soon.
The famous people of the world
will come to hear the announcement
of the Tiber.
He will say that we will capture
Paradis this year.
The fate of Marley and the Jews
depends on this plan.
Defeat is unacceptable.
In love with the homeland
our hearts must beat in unison.
Goliath seems
to disagree with something.
But he will fulfill the order
unconditionally.
Why don't they think of something secret?
I didn't like one phrase, Zika.
They are not in this room.
I see.

go back there?
