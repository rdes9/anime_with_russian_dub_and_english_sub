        <pre>I don't think so, Hitch.
You see, titan memories are often awakened during contact.
I thought, what if I could get some important information?
I didn't have anything in mind.
I don't think so.
I don't think so.
I don't think so.
I don't think so.
I don't think so.
I don't think so.
I didn't have anything in mind.
You're a guy after all.
I understand you're interested in important information about Annie.
I admit my fault, but please don't forbid me to come.
Relax, I won't forbid you.
Annie is boring when I'm the only interlocutor.
You're so annoying.
Just sleep, and the guys will stick to you.
I don't think so.
I don't think so.
I don't think so.
I don't think so.
I don't think so.
I don't think so.
I don't think so.
I don't think so.
I don't think so.
I don't think so.
I don't think so.
I don't think so.
I don't think so.
I don't think so.
I don't think so.
I don't think so.
I don't think so.
The districts fault the people.
The districts fault the people.
You've just been told off.
Haven't].
You've just been told off.
Remember all these people?
Yes.
Tell me about them.
The military has illegally arrested Eren Yeager.
Their mistrust of the military has reached a critical point.
And the command does not give the answers that the people would arrange.
But it doesn't matter. You can't tell about Zika and Gul of the Earth.
Only Eren can save the Eldians!
Only Yeager can beg for those who have been eaten by the Titans!
Without Eren Yeager there will be no new Eldian Empire!
What's going on?
They say the people have surrounded the entire headquarters.
Hey, Hitch! Come on, help me too!
I don't have enough of my own work!
Armin!
Mikasa!
I'm so glad you made it!
We won't waste precious time. Let's hurry.
Are the scouts newbies?
What did they do in the headquarters?
That day I really went to meet with Eren.
I'm sorry I kept quiet about it.
I understand that this is a sufficient reason to keep volunteers under arrest.
As always, you are the embodiment of modesty.
I thought you didn't know anything about the world.
It will be too late until you make a decision.
Eren also felt the danger that was approaching.
What's next?
Did you give Eren advice to get into Marley's heart alone
and encourage the military to come to his aid?
Nothing like that.
I just offered to help.
That's all.
A secret meeting is usually arranged in order to conclude a certain agreement.
As you said, we weren't in the position to ask for a meeting with him even in public.
And then you took advantage of the secret meeting,
turned Eren to your side and achieved the result you needed.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend you.
I just wanted Eren JÃ¤ger to know who I am.
No, we really wanted the Titan to take Eren's parents to Marley's heart.
That's it.
We really wanted the Titan to take Eren's parents to Marley's heart.
That's it.
He fulfilled our dream and inflicted a heavy blow on Marley.
No.
He even exceeded all expectations.
He punished Marley alone,
which for many years caused us heavy suffering.
The fact that a man of such great abilities has all the titans of his parents.
Commander Pixis, do you understand what's going on in front of us?
We're watching the turning point of history.
Thanks to the two brothers, the world is born again.
I just want to watch this being next to them.
So the real reason for the secret meeting with Eren was curiosity?
I suppose so.
I know Daz.
All the other volunteers know nothing about my meeting with him.
It's all because of my haste.
I can't deny that I lied to you,
but I acted only for the sake of L.D.
I would like to believe that too.
I ask you to retell the conversation with Eren in detail.
Do you know how to make a good lie?
Sometimes I add parts of the truth to it.
Well, well.
After everything that happened, I was led astray to the depths of my soul.
Aren't we on the same side?
After all, all these three years, we worked together to build an iron road,
raise the trade and go to the island of wealth.
We gave L.D. and that's it.
I'm sorry.
Just 10 months ago we celebrated the opening of the iron road, and now...
That's right.
After all, we all swore to fight for the future of L.D.
What's the matter?
What?
Elena admitted that she secretly met with Eren?
Really?
You really didn't know?
I didn't even guess.
Honestly.
It seems he really didn't know.
At least I believe.
So, Elena...
Elena would never have done that.
You won't say that?
Because you think it's quite in her character?
Well...
You know...
Even though it's a back number,
but we got the reason for the need for your arrest.
Tell us everything you know about Elena.
It's also for the sake of our future.
As you know, Elena was the one who organized the volunteers.
At first we doubted each other, and the unity didn't work out.
And then she wiped her hands every time,
to prove the loyalty to Zika and the organization.
All the Marlies who suspected us,
even friends with whom we ate and lived,
died in unfortunate cases.
We believed that all the good things of our native countries,
the Marlies,
and survived the losses.
Strange.
She didn't refuse the Marlies' rights.
Even if she came to argue with the government,
you say that Elena was so merciless to the Marlies.
But on the island...
So, come with me.
Onyan Kupon.
What?
Looks like Hanji is busy as usual.
Yes.
He says he needs to check something.
Yes.
I let Hanji take one volunteer.
But I can't let you meet with Aaron.
But why?
Because now his connection with volunteers has become obvious.
Aaron carefully hid what he had to do with him,
which led to the recent attack on Marley.
Now there is an investigation,
who organized the meeting and who was involved in it.
Since the time of the discovery of these facts,
Aaron keeps silence.
We still don't know anything about the time
that he spent alone in Marley.
According to our assumption,
Aaron is most likely on a mission with Zika.
I told you this as an exception,
so please don't say a word to anyone.
Aaron, how come?
What will happen to Aaron now?
What is it?
Don't pay attention.
He had nowhere to go, so he ordered the volunteers to bring him.
But Commander,
if Aaron doesn't say anything,
then we should be useful.
I can't promise that we will be able to see his true intentions,
but it won't hurt to try.
The situation requires extreme caution.
The conversation is over.
Why?
You said it right, it won't hurt.
Why can't it?
I can only assume
that the government has refused Aaron's plans.
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.
I can't do it.
I can't.
I can't do it.
You can't do it.
Who can do it?
May I come in?
If it's really so,
the heir to Titan is already selected,
I'm listening to the conversation in the office.
Wait, Mikasa.
Don't be afraid.
They won't notice me.
Now it's better not to disrupt the law.
I won't let you do it, Aaron.
Armin, are you hurt?
I don't think so.
Put out the fire!
What happened?
There are wounded!
Hurry!
Everyone here, help!
Hurry!
You're not hurt?
Hitch, what happened?
An explosion in the commander's office.
Where is he?
Give up your hearts!
Our anger has found an answer!
It's time to fight!
I'm going to fight too.
Me!
Me!
Exactly!
It's all for the victory of the new Jewish faith!
Show them our rage!
Give up your hearts!
Give up your hearts!
Give up your hearts!
Give up your hearts!
Give up your hearts!
Give up your hearts!
In a special chair, the property of the commander-in-chief Zakli,
according to our assumption, a bomb was laid.
Together with the commander-in-chief, the victims were four soldiers.
The culprits and their goals are unknown.
He was with me all day.
And all the other volunteers were under guard.
Then what other forces could have done this?
That chair.
The commander-in-chief said that he was brought by the New Brantz.
Whose New Brantz?
He did not clarify.
But Mikasa and I, before entering the commander-in-chief's office,
saw newcomers coming out of the headquarters.
They were scouts.
By the way, about the scouts.
I heard that among them there are those who are punished for disclosing information about Aaron.
Urgent message!
Aaron Yeager ran away from the underground prison!
Gather all the soldiers and start searching!
Yes, sir!
Hurry up!
We're going too!
What's going on?
How many of you are there?
Not all of them are here.
Our people are in the ranks of the military.
Among them are those who planted the bomb on Darius Zakhli.
You are the only one who can save the Aldi Empire.
Aaron Yeager.
Everything will be fine, Mikasa.
Aaron will understand us.
If we talk, he will definitely understand us.
Let's find out where Zik is.
Flock Falster, as well as more than a hundred soldiers,
disappeared from the cell with their prisoners.
We believe that all this army at the same time freed Aaron and deserted him.
The murder of the commander-in-chief must also be the case of their hands.
It is inconvenient to call them by their names.
Let's give them the name of the Diversion Anti-Army Organization of Yeagerists.
And the goal of the Yeagerists is ...
There are guesses, Hanje.
Zik and Aaron's meeting and everything they achieve.
Then they reform the army with Aaron in charge.
The murder of the commander-in-chief demonstrated their decisiveness.
This time their actions directly caused what the military intended to convey about the parents of Aaron to another.
How can we not know about this?
We knew what would happen if we knew.
After all, most of the Yeagerists are scouts.
How are you going to answer for this, Commander Hanje?
I will bear any punishment.
But now I will not go to such irresponsibility as dismissal.
In addition, it is not yet known how many Yeagerists are hidden in each kind of army.
Exactly.
Maybe they are under my nose.
I'm not surprised even if one of you breaks up.
Look, don't talk nonsense.
And how will you prove otherwise?
If you can't, you can't leave the scouts free.
Stop it!
Here are our guests.
We have more important things to do.
We need to sort things out between ourselves.
Hanje, who knows where to keep Zik?
Levi and 30 soldiers who keep him under surveillance.
There are three more who are responsible for communication and supply.
Except for them, only me.
Then bring these three here.
Nil, the Queen's residence is safe.
He knows about the limited circle.
But now I will check again.
The first goals of Aaron will be to contact Zik and the Queen of History.
First of all, we need to provide them with full protection.
Yes!
Commander Pixis, after the loss of the Commander-in-Chief,
you are the only one who can unite us under your leadership.
What are your plans for the future?
We lost the full program.
We give in to Aaron.
There is nothing to do when the enemies appear in our ranks.
Even if it turns out to smoke them all out,
who knows how much more blood will spill.
And we don't have time for such nonsense.
Because of us, many soldiers were disappointed with the service.
This is the reason for our defeat.
How so?
Do you want to bow to those who killed the Commander-in-Chief?
I've known Zackle for a long time.
He would be glad to live in the revolution and die in the revolution.
In addition, the other four dead would not want to be destroyed
in order to pay for their death.
So are you going to bow to the Yeager brothers?
We will bow.
We will start negotiations with the Yeagerists
on the transfer of the position of Zackle.
As planned, we will observe the experimental gul of the Earth
and put on it the survival of the Eldians.
However, the murder of our Commander-in-Chief
we will avoid in silence.
If this will prevent the death of hundreds or thousands of our comrades,
then the price is low.
So, everyone to work!
Yes!
Commander.
I'm sorry for such an unpleasant sight.
It's not worth it.
Each country has gone this way.
I can't guarantee your complete safety.
Please wait in the port until we take control of the situation.
Okay.
We sincerely wish the victory of the Eldians.
Mrs. Mikasa.
If something happens, please run to our ship right away.
Mrs. Kiyomi.
Thank you for your concern.
However, I remain an Eldian.
I want to follow the future of the island where I was born and grew up.
Please don't worry about me.
What are you talking about?
We came here for you.
And if there was no talk of resources,
who would not hold power in our country?
For you, only successful application of the gul of the Earth is important, right?
Yes.
If his strength does not justify hope,
then the authorities of Hizuru will call for their support.
Investments will burst like a soap bubble.
And for the Adzumabit people, the end will come.
Then I can't rely on you.
By the time of great shocks, the Adzumabit people were able to adapt.
But now we are stung by the shame of greedy and despicable foxes.
However, this does not mean that we have lost the family pride
that your mother gave you.
No matter what happens to this country, I will definitely protect you at any cost.
Are we going to help Eren, the killer of the Commander-in-Chief?
It is not yet known that this truth was made by him.
But not so loud, Mikasa.
They themselves already suspect us as the Yagerists.
And in fact, how, Mikasa?
On whose side?
I said that Armin and I almost died in that explosion.
Isn't that enough for you?
What?
Stop it!
Commander Pixis was right.
The Adzumabit people will only lead to the collapse.
So you think that you can trust Eren and Zika without any problems?
No, I don't think so.
Judging by our position,
the insurance that Zika and Elena have arranged for themselves has taken effect.
It should be considered that they have been insured more than once and more than twice.
We are now going to reveal the plan of Zika
until he exposes us to even more fools.
However, I do not mind if everything turns out to be my own guesswork.
Do you have any guesses?
The prisoners she was guarding are working in interesting places.
For example, in a restaurant.
A real palace.
I've never been to such houses.
Me too.
In the joy of the guys.
Today you can eat until the collapse.
Yes.
It seems that something is not quite right.
I don't think so.
I don't think so.
I don't think so.
