Good luck on your way, Aaron.
Mikasa.
It's time for us to go home.
Why am I here?
Are you so tired that you managed to fall asleep?
Well, I have a feeling that I saw a terribly long dream.
But I don't remember what it was about.
Aaron, why are you crying?
I'm sorry.
Halil, don't tell anyone about our secret.
We will save money until this bag is full.
And when we succeed, we will start a new life somewhere far away from here.
Ramzin, but if you continue to steal,
they will cut off your left hand one day.
Then Grandpa will definitely be very upset.
So what? Do we have another way out?
If we live in these empty tents,
then every winter more and more families will mourn their dead relatives.
So, Halil, if I die, give me the money for the funeral.
Ramzin.
Hide!
What are they doing?
City people.
Get up!
Are they running away?
Why?
But I can say for sure,
all these people will die because of me.
And this will happen in the near future.
Or rather, I will kill them.
I'm already dead.
I'm dead.
I'm dead.
I'm dead.
I'm dead.
I have already made a decision.
It is unlikely that anyone on Paradis Island
will be able to find a way to survive.
Everything will disappear without exception.
Houses, people, animals, hopes and dreams.
Mom, what would you say?
Maybe it's true.
It's better for all Eldians to die.
The first king, Sten, thought so.
Compared to the rest of the world,
no one lives on the island.
And if there is not a single Eldian,
then the problem of the Titans will be solved by itself.
But I just can't make up with it.
I saw it in my memories of the future.
Most likely, I will save this boy.
This scoundrel came from another country
and is cleaning other people's pockets.
We all have open shops here,
and he scares off customers.
So we decided to teach him a lesson.
It doesn't concern you at all.
Get out!
Yes, you are right.
And what did I find?
I'll kill this boy anyway.
What's the matter with me?
Take it!
I'm going to do something unthinkable.
It's not my idea of cruelty.
It seems that the future will not change.
Thank you.
I'm just like you, Rainer.
A stupid fool.
I'm not.
I'm worse.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Why are you apologizing?
Ramsey! Khalil!
Come here!
What's the matter? Ramsey!
Run! Run!
Where are the Titans coming from?
Up the mountain!
It's no use. Look back!
The Titans have already crossed the mountains!
It can't be!
We're all dead!
We can't run away from them!
The Marleys ran away and didn't even warn us!
They will catch up with us soon!
That's it.
Ramsey!
We have to save the children somehow!
They will kill us all now!
Of course not!
Don't even think about giving up!
I have to save the Eldia Islands.
And I don't see any other way out.
Our money!
Khalil!
I imagined the world in a completely different way.
The walls were like this.
I dreamed about them when I was a kid.
Khalil!
The books of Armin were described in a completely different way.
I learned that people lived behind the walls.
I was like a cruel man.
And I wanted...
...that there would be no trace left of him.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Forgive me!
I'm sorry.
Hey! Open the door!
I'm sorry.
Do you hear? Is anybody here?
Do you hear?
Dear, is this the day when we will pay for our sins?
I'm sorry.
Let me go!
Get in! Get in!
The day when we will pay for our sins.
The day when we will pay for our sins.
Ever since I was born,
this new wall has been irritating me.
Fiery water,
icy ground,
a sandy plain.
Those who saw them...
...were the freest people in this world.
This is...
...freedom!
Finally, I was able to see it with my own eyes.
Right, Armin?
Are you okay?
I'm hurt!
Your wounds are already stretched.
What?
Annie?
Yes, I'm like a new one.
Although I didn't think that I would be able to relax.
I'm already somehow out of it.
– Don't you want to sit down? – Yes, I do.
I didn't thank you for talking to me for so many years.
Thank you.
I was lonely. I almost lost my mind.
Only your sketches and business cards helped me to survive this nightmare.
– No. – I don't understand why you came there.
– You could have talked to Stenka with the same success. – What?
You could have found a normal girl and talked to her.
Well, probably.
But I wanted to talk to you.
Really?
– What? – What?
You really don't understand?
The witch was messing with me forever!
I don't understand.
God, we have nothing else to do.
We're talking about some kind of nonsense.
And at this time, millions of people are dying all over the world.
I understand. You're just a good person.
That's why you wanted to convince even the enemy in your right, right?
For the same reason you argued with Aaron until the end, right?
You don't like conflicts.
You're ready to talk to sleeping monsters if you have a chance to escape them.
Do you understand?
Please, don't go away.
There's something else. I've already told you.
I still can't stand it when I'm called a good person.
After all, I'm a murderer.
I killed even civilians, even children.
Moreover, I betrayed the homeland and the earthlings,
although I had to protect them.
I killed my own people.
It's not for me to call someone a monster.
I knew there would be a day when Aaron and I would fulfill our promises.
And we'll be able to see the world behind the walls.
But everything turned out to be not as happy as you imagined.
Yes. In our dreams, he was completely different.
But…
You know, I want to believe that the world we saw behind the walls
can still surprise us.
It's a quiet night.
The people of Odisha fled to the south long before our arrival.
The ship has been frozen for a long time.
Well, all hope is on you, respected Adzumabit.
Yes. No matter what, we will raise a flying ship to the sky.
Take off the cover! Come on!
Damn! The explosives are getting in the way!
So we'll cut it off.
Wait!
It can still come in handy.
Let's put it in the boat.
No!
It means everyone is dead!
Even Commander Magat, the rebels, my family, everyone!
Yes.
The head of the Earth has already swallowed the main part of the Marley continent.
And what will happen next?
Well, tell me!
Tell me! Tell me!
What shall we do?
I'm sorry.
But I don't know.
Annie, check the equipment.
You're not used to the new OPM yet, are you?
Go around the district with Rainer.
Practice.
What for?
You can't sit with your hands folded now.
I told you not to count on me.
Are you really not going to fly with us?
I'm sorry.
But yes.
I don't quite understand why we have to save everyone.
Humanity has been oppressing us all the time, the Marley Eldians.
You know that yourself.
It has always been like that since I was born.
And even if we manage to stop the gulf of the Earth,
Marley will still be destroyed.
After that, no one will forgive the Eldians.
I'm ashamed of them.
They have enough small hopes for success to try to save the Motherland.
But I can't fight anymore.
I want to spend at least the last hours with him.
And for how long?
What are you talking about?
Oh, I see.
What are you talking about?
I understand you.
You have sacrificed so many people.
But Armin will sit with us in a flying ship.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
However, Armin will sit with us in a flying ship
and go after Aeron.
I know.
Do you want that too?
You'll fly to kill Aeron to save humanity.
Don't kill him.
I'll bring him back to us no matter what.
I don't need anything else.
By the way, where did your scarf go?
It's with me.
Calm down. You need to rest.
I'll rest as I play in the box.
I need to return a couple of debts.
Looks like you're ready to order a wreath for my grave.
The bearded woman has recovered from the fever after the fracture.
We need to make her go where Aeron is going.
If the Flautia of the World Coalition decides to capture Paradis,
they will first have to gather in the military port of Caliph.
After the rebellion, the allies will come to their senses for a month
to gather their forces.
And you, get in touch with Zik, get the progenitor's titan
and launch a partial gul of land.
There are several hundred titans in the Shigan Shina wall.
More than enough to win.
Why do you think it will be a victory?
What will prevent them from attacking Paradis again when they recover?
If the coalition loses the entire fleet, it will ruin its economy.
It will cause a domino effect all over the world.
With such a crisis, they will not have time for us for a long time.
It is worth mentioning about the fleet not far from the mountain in the south of Marley.
I am a little worried about the research base with the Derezhabli.
Most likely, it is the second target of Aeron.
Where is Salta's fortress?
If he knows where the weapons are stored,
with which there will be a chance against the progenitor,
then after the war port of Caliph, he will go there
to destroy the Derezhabli.
You are talking too much.
I would like just one thing from you.
Please admit. Yes, Zik lost.
But he was right.
The plan in Tonaz was the only reasonable solution to the thousand-year problem.
It was the best fate for the Eldians.
Don't you agree even now?
Yes, I agree with you.
I could not convince Aeron.
I could not put hope on a better future.
I let us down.
That's all. There are no more barrels on the ship.
Let them stand there.
Please take care of them.
It is not safe on the water now.
Anything can happen.
But it is better than to fly with us.
Of course, I agree with you.
But what if the children start to be stubborn?
Lock them in the cabin.
And do not let them out until the flying boat takes off.
But why are you...
I am bound to avenge those who died for us.
I will fulfill the military duty to the end.
Miss Hanji!
We will be ready to leave in about an hour.
I see.
Have you heard him?
Start checking the equipment.
Yes, sir!
Two fingers is more than enough.
I can handle it.
It turns out that I decided to run away alone.
Do not worry.
The Marlits did not see anything in you except the weapons.
You do not have to risk your life for them and this country.
I wanted to apologize to you and Bertolt for a long time.
I am to blame for everything.
If I had not insisted on completing the mission...
If we had come back then...
I would not have done it.
If we had come back then...
You and Bertolt...
We would have come back to our homeland
and been able to see our families.
I will never be able to buy wine in front of you.
Yes, I wanted to kill you so many times
that I have already lost count.
I envy your endurance.
Take care of Gabi and Falko.
I will.
Annie!
Take care of yourself!
See you!
Armin, do you want to stop her?
What for?
To be honest, I thought she would go with us.
Yes, but she has gone through so much
that it is impossible to understand her.
I am glad for Annie.
She finally thinks about herself.
Do you really want to go with us?
Even if we stop the gulf of the earth,
the Eldians will have an enviable fate.
You are right.
But we should not give up and forget
about the last order of Field Marshal Magatta.
Unite your forces and fulfill your duty.
Vick!
Shall I sit on the back of the transporter
and feel the heat of his body next time?
No, I am sometimes pulled over by you.
As always, the Titans do not respond to you
I think we still have a long way to go.
Levi, what do you think?
The others are watching us.
The fallen, in your opinion,
would be proud of our decisions.
Stop asking such questions,
or you will end up like him.
That's all. You may start the refueling.
Yes, sir!
What a miracle!
We made it before the gulf of the earth.
Flock!
I can't believe it!
The whole way to the cover of the ship is stuck!
Khadji!
He shot the fuel tank!
We won't be able to take off like this!
Don't rush.
If we make holes, you'll get there.
Bring the welder!
How much time do we need?
If we have time to cover them with tin sheets,
it will take an hour.
Damn it!
Really?
No.
No.
The gulf of the earth is already here.
No, don't fly.
No.
Don't fly there.
Flock!
They will kill all of us.
We are demons for them.
Don't leave us.
Hope.
Hey, Flock!
He's dead.
I know.
The probability of this is not zero.
You're right.
But I can't give up.
Even if not today.
But one day.
No, why? Open it!
The Titans are very close! Open it, please!
Shut up!
Armin, any ideas?
No, not a single one.
I have to stay and detain them.
Excluded.
You are our last trump card to stop Armin.
I'll take care of them.
Hold on to them.
We can no longer waste the power of any of the Titans.
You are here because you followed my orders.
We had to spill the blood of our former allies.
I am responsible for this.
Hange.
Armin Arlert.
Now you are the fifteenth commander of the reconnaissance unit.
The commander of the reconnaissance unit has the main goal.
It is to correctly assess the situation and not give up.
You are perfectly suited for this position.
Take care of everything.
That's the way it is. Bye, guys.
Oh, yes.
Levi is now your subordinate.
Take advantage of the situation.
Hey, you.
Do you understand, Levi?
My turn has finally come.
I'm so eager to look good right now.
Can you imagine?
Please don't get in my way.
Let's light our hearts.
This is the first time I've heard you say that.
Ms. Hange!
Oh, yes.
How did you manage to do that?
I'm so proud of you.
I'm so proud of you.
Oh, yes.
How wonderful the Titans are.
Let's light our hearts.
This is the first time I've heard you say that.
I'm so proud of you.
I'm so proud of you.
Oh, yes.
How did you manage to do that?
I'm so proud of you.
How wonderful the Titans are.
I'm so proud of you.
I'm so proud of you.
Let's light our hearts.
Let's light our hearts.
They're so close!
We're out of time!
Can you start the engine?
Come on, guys!
I can't do this.
Damn it!
Start the engine!
Grab on!
No, Hange!
Goodbye, Hange.
We'll meet again.
What happened to the boat?
It took off.
Hange, you did a great job.
Erwin?
Guys!
I'm so proud of you.
How did you manage to do that?
I'm so proud of you.
How did you manage to do that?
I'm so proud of you.
How did you manage to do that?
I'm so proud of you.
How did you manage to do that?
Oh!
How did you manage to do that?
And it's over?
Sure.
– Fuel? – Yes. Only half of it was refueled.
Will we reach the salt fortress?
It's not a different matter.
Mrs. Hange sacrificed her life for us to take off.
I won't let her down.
I'll take you there no matter what.
I promise.
That's why you have to stop Kul of the Earth.
No matter what.
Yes.
Hold the steering wheel.
Not the anchor.
Well, let's discuss the strategy.
Captain Peek saw the Titan of the Progenitor.
He looks like this.
Yes. But I didn't have time to look at him.
You'll notice a giant pile of bones, you won't be mistaken.
He's like an insect.
If he was an ordinary Titan,
his body would be hidden in a
warm place.
But he can move around the whole body,
like a young boy.
So, we don't know where Aaron will be.
It's not very fundamental.
We can just destroy the whole body.
Like the time when you took off the face of the Earth,
Port Rebellio.
Who cares about it?
It's true.
It's the simplest and most effective way.
But first of all, I want to talk to Aaron.
If I can't reach him, we'll go for it.
But only in this case.
Even if the last measure is the safest,
Aaron controls the Progenitors only thanks to the power of Zika.
Can Kul of the Earth stop his move?
If we finish him off first.
Right.
It might work.
That's what Hanji thought, but there's no proof.
But we don't know where Zika is.
We won't have to search for long.
I'm sure this damn monkey is hiding in this pile of bones.
I'll finish off Zika.
Please.
Help me.
Captain.
Of course.
To get to this board, we shed the blood of our comrades.
And we won't let their deaths be in vain.
I'm ready to do anything to honor their memory.
And stop Kul of the Earth.
Jean.
I decided to kill Samuel and Daza.
I cut my acquaintance's face into pieces.
They think I'm a traitor.
And I'm sure I did it for the sake of saving the world.
Hey, Reiner.
Was Bertel Dueney to you the same?
Yes.
I can't atone for this sin.
I'll be blaming myself for the rest of my life.
Even if I save the rest of humanity.
Still, it doesn't mean we should give up hope.
You're right, Reiner.
We won't do anything else now.
Even if it's for the sake of our sins.
You're right.
We're the same as you, Reiner.
I killed for the sake of the common good.
So there's nothing between us.
So there's nothing between us at all.
Yes.
In the evening of Reiner's raid, Eren told me the same thing.
I think I'm starting to understand his thoughts.
Maybe Eren wants us to stop him.
Why did you do that?
Maybe my intuition was right.
I noticed the contradiction, too.
Eren can influence all the Titans and the Eldians if he wants to.
But despite that, we can still use the power of the Titans.
Are you saying Eren wanted to untie our hands?
Yes. He left us the Titans.
As if he wanted to check what we were going to do with them, Tani.
But why?
That's how we can stop Goal of the Earth.
It must be.
He's not on his own.
Imagine that you're in his place and you're setting up a genocide.
If it were me, I'd try to give the power of the progenitor to anyone.
And if I couldn't do it to anyone, I'd like to be killed.
At least someone.
What? Again?
It's...
Again?
Did he hear us?
Eren! Listen to us!
Stop it!
Now our island is safe!
No one's going to attack it for a few centuries!
After what you've done, everyone's afraid to even think about the invasion!
Now we can stop and sign a non-aggression treaty!
We don't need to kill anyone anymore!
Nothing threatens the island anymore!
Please, forgive us!
We understand that you've decided to do it for our sake!
Eren!
Eren!
We'll sort it out ourselves!
That's it!
You've shed enough blood to protect us!
Yes, sir!
Eren!
I never forgave you because of Sasha's death!
But you've also gone through a lot of trouble!
I've never even tried to understand you!
Eren...
I...
I want to share this time with you.
We've done the same sins as you did.
And we don't want you to push us away.
So...
Please, come back to us!
Listen, Eren...
If you stop now, you'll only make a mess.
Hey...
Maybe you'll say something?
Eren!
The
Earth's
gulf won't stop.
And I won't leave
the future of Paradise
to the will of fate.
I'll keep going forward.
Hey!
Eren!
Eren!
What? A child? Where did it come from?
No!
It's Eren in his childhood!
Eren!
Why are you running away, Eren?
Are you hinting that you don't trust us?
Why did you make it so that we can still use the power of the Titans?
We'll have enough time here!
Talk to me!
We've always been together!
Together we can take off the sadness of our souls!
Eren!
In order to gain freedom,
I'll take it from the world.
But I won't take anything from you.
Because you're free.
Your desire to protect the world
is a manifestation of your freedom and will.
And the fact that I keep going forward
is mine.
Each of us has a conviction
that we're ready to fight for.
That's why we don't have to fight.
You just need one thing.
To fight.
How come?
Then why?
Why?
Why did you call us here?
To say that we have nothing to discuss with you.
If you want to stop me,
try to break my breath.
After all, you're free.
What's wrong? What's wrong with you?
It seems that my intuition was right.
Really? There's no other way!
Well, the negotiations have failed.
What's next?
Commander?
Where are we going?
In a couple of days, we'll get to Heizer.
I believe that Mrs. Mikasa and her companions
will stop Gul of the Earth.
However, our country
can no longer handle its own forces.
It seems that I'll have to wait for some time.
I'm not sure about that.
I'm not sure about that either.
I'm not sure about that either.
I'm not sure about that either.
It seems that I'll have to wait for some time to eat only fish.
Heizer is famous for his fish dishes.
Great!
How is the meat there?
It's because of me that Zika and Aaron could meet.
I can never buy wine
for the fact that I put my hand on this terrible battle.
So, you would like to fix everything?
You wouldn't interfere in the affairs of the Eldians
and throw the Paradis into death?
We can't turn back time.
However, it doesn't mean that I don't like wine.
I'll lie if I say that I devoted my life
to the Eldians' help in solving their problems.
I wanted to preserve the honor of the clan
and the deals that will multiply its wealth.
Why don't we value what we have
until we lose it?
What matters is not profit or loss,
but respect for other people.
It's too late to eat.
I'm going to sleep now.
Annie, I saw a dream.
A dream? Goliard?
No, Zika's dream.
Or rather, a memory.
Listen, the female character
can use the power of the titan through part of his body, right?
Well, yes, that's right.
So I'm right, then?
Then we'll really make it.
Yes, we can do it.
Shut up, little ones. You'd better go get some coal.
You said you saw Zika's memories.
Yeah, I became a titan
because of Zika's spinal-brain fluid.
It seems that he has awakened the abilities of a beast-like titan.
That's how it is.
And what's wrong with that?
Most often I see memories
in which I fly high above the clouds
and think that I can do the same.
And I feel it.
This is the Salt Fortress.
Do they really have a watchtower?
I don't know.
When we get to this rock, we'll see.
Do you really think you can catch the titan and run away?
You damn Ildean!
Watch your tongue, you little rascal.
Or have you forgotten, thanks to someone who hasn't been kicked out yet?
If you don't burn out with the titan,
your family will also be killed by the gul of the earth.
And if you think you can betray us, I'll shoot your head off.
If you want to save yourself and your family, do as they say.
I don't care that the chances of success are slim.
I have to survive and keep my word.
Don't worry, Mr. Brown.
Our children are strong.
I'm sure that now they'll be with Colt and Reiner.
They went to the island of demons!
Do you think they could survive there?
If she hadn't become a warrior, we would have finally met.
Reiner!
Hey, Finger, throw away that bandage already.
The path is just a bandage. I would have done it a long time ago.
But for her, my daughter sacrificed everything she had.
Oh my God.
Hey, look!
Oh, come on.
Keep it for me.
Give me a pair. We need one more.
Now!
Hey, what's that smoke?
It's the gul of the earth.
They caught up with us.
It's empty!
There's not a single one left!
How could it be?
We were hoping for them.
Why?
It's all over.
Wait.
Those gul of the earth are heading for the Titans.
What does it mean?
Bombardment.
They're going to the Titans.
What do you mean?
They're going to the Titans.
What do you mean?
Bombardment.
They're going to the Titans.
Revenge from the heavens.
It's the attack of the fate of the entire humanity.
Bombardment?
Seriously?
They want to save us?
I'm addressing the gul of the earth and all the soldiers in this fortress.
We are the last line of defense of the entire humanity.
There is no crime without the responsibility that lies on our shoulders.
But no matter what the outcome of this battle is,
we all need to learn from this lesson.
We will reap the fruits of our own ignorance.
We were killing with hatred,
lulling her, believing that our salvation is in her.
We sent her to the demons from the island and blamed them for all our sins.
And in the end, this hatred returned to us with a thorn,
giving birth to a monster that wants to punish us.
If we survive and can start all over again,
we will never make this mistake again.
I give you my word.
I give you my word.
I always thought of him only as a weapon of my own.
You can't call me and my parents. No.
And me.
I would like you to give your word too.
Put an end to mutual hatred.
I report! The Japs are on the target!
All that's left is to gain altitude and they will drop the shells.
The door to the world opens, where no one will be oppressed.
Let's end all fear!
The attacker has moved!
Start bombing!
Drop it!
Drop it!
Too high! Too low!
Let them continue! We will put an end to this attack!
Let them continue!
Let them continue!
Let them continue!
The squadron of Japs is completely destroyed!
Forgive me.
Children should pay for our crimes.
Mom, listen. The Titans will be here soon. I'm scared.
Forgive me.
I think Annie and Rainer survived and are now in paradise.
Yes.
Look!
What is it?
Damn! A little more!
Here they are! Get ready to jump!
Ayankapon! What are you doing there?
It's too early! We need to get there before dawn!
As soon as I land you, I'll go to land!
Ayankapon!
And here you are!
You're a fucking beast!
We won't have to look for him.
The purpose of the attack is a beast-like Titan!
The first thing to do is get rid of him!
The first thing to do is get rid of him!
The first thing to do is get rid of him!
The first thing to do is get rid of him!
The beast-like Titan!
The first thing to do is get rid of him!
We're going to stop the Earth Goal!
Now!
Eren!
Eren!
Damn! I can't land!
Eren!
Ryder!
For action!
An armored Titan?
And the Titan is a transporter?
The others seem to be using TPM.
Do the Paradise soldiers really want to stop the Earth Goal?
Ryder!
Eren!
Let me ask you one more question.
Do you really think you're free?
Will you answer me when I get you out of there?
Eren!
Eren!
Eren!
Eren!
Eren!
Eren!
Eren!
Eren!
