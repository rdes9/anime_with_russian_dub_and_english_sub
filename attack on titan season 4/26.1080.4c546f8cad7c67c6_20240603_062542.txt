Who knew that the Flock is so fast?
If the Icarus will destroy the flying boat, then we're done.
Why are they so fast?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Why are we done?
Why haven't they done it yet?
Who knows?
Most likely, they have no confidence that we will try to stop the Icarus.
It's not so difficult to destroy the ship.
But if we destroy the world, it will take more than a decade to recreate the technology.
If they need an uninhabited continent, then they will need a flying boat.
The port could be occupied in order to keep the Icarus.
After all, they have both ships and engineers.
Only if they find out that we are also stuck here,
then they will immediately destroy the hydroplane.
It will be difficult for them to resist even with the strength of nine titans.
However, if we count now, we will not catch up with the progenitor.
We need a plan.

Episode One
I will kill everyone there at once.
Otherwise, the flying boat will not survive.
For this, we will use everything.
And the strength of the titans.
And your weapons.
Will it work?
Wait.
So what?
If we attack the port in a row,
Azumabit will also get it.
Exactly.
Your distant relatives are also enemies for us.
One of those who attacked our homeland.
No.
Azumabit's death will create problems, Eni.
Am I right?
Exactly.
I'll figure it out myself.
But without the mechanics of Azumabit,
it's just a boat without wings.
After all, now they are folded
to make it easier to transport across the sea.
Of course, to fly,
just straighten the wings is not enough.
According to the original plan,
it needs to be put in the hangar to conduct their maintenance and flight training.
And only then fly to the task.
But it will take time.
I don't know.
It depends on Azumabit.
That's how it works.
You need to save Azumabit,
and also save time for the maintenance of the boat.
And it's better
that everything goes without seriously injured and dead Yagerists.
Is that what you want?
Of course, we don't want to kill.
With some, we are together with the Kadets.
Well, what to do?
Explain to me.
How to avoid the dead from the side of the enemy?
How to win time and protect the flying boat and Azumabit
while they set it up?
Tell me, Armin.
Do as you did when you drove me into the corner.
Tell me your plan.
We don't have a plan.
Either we'll manage everything at once,
or we'll crash and lose the plane.
Wait.
We came here to save people.
Why?
The first case of the killing of the island relatives.
Why did it happen?
You're right.
If you understand,
you don't have to support us
and you don't have to make this choice.
You wouldn't have chosen to destroy the wall
on that day,
unlike us.
In fact,
I'm the same as you.
So that's what
he wanted to say then.
You can't fight the four of you.
Watch from a safe place
together with Gaby and Falko.
If the Egerists find you,
you'll have to make a choice
whether you want it or not.
But for now,
stay out of it.
You're just suggesting
to look at the battlefield.
But
I don't think
the Titan's search will solve everything here.
I'm not going to be a spectator.
Besides,
I've already killed four Egerists.
And most importantly,
humanity has no time left.
I saw
titans leaving the sea,
a pair of them fell from them.
The speed is so fast
that some of them
are already on the Marley Tirek.
Now they're going to destroy the cities
in the northeast.
I didn't think the titans
could cross the ocean so fast.
How many times
have they already killed people?
Tell me where the Eren Eger went.
Until you tell me,
I'm going to make your left hand a new elbow.
Magat!
Don't be afraid.
I'm not going to kill you.
Wonderful.
I've changed my mind.
I don't want to die until I see
how things are going.
If you took me with you,
I could tell you where the Eren is going.
Maybe.
First, we need to get the plane.
Yes.
There's no time for torture.
Konya.
Armin.
Mikasa.
Jean.
I'm sorry for what I did last night.
We were wrong.
I said the truth so easily.
I've been trying to justify my side
in the most useless way.
I was afraid to look at the face of the mean Marley
and admit that I was a part of it.
It's not your fault.
It's wrong to blame the past on you
just because we're from the same people.
Peek.
Annie.
Reiner.
And you, too,
shouldn't bear the hatred of the world.
However,
they shouldn't forget the stupid,
blood-stained history
and are obliged to pass it on to future generations.
Eren Yeager wants to lose everything.
We can't let that happen.
Until we turn away from our stupid deeds,
the hell won't end.
So,
please,
close your eyes now.
This is the stupidity we're going to do.
I refuse.
I will not bless you with clean hands.
Just look at this cloud of steam.
There has never been such a dramatic change in history.
Of course, Hizuru will not be an exception.
There will be no trace of her culture.
She will turn into a bare plain.
You have nothing else to worry about.
We need everything
for you to benefit the island.
Fortunately,
the best engineers of Hizuru are gathered here.
Well,
if you don't want to lose even more people,
just do what we ask you to do.
I would not like to see your high mood.
Tell me, what changes are you so happy about?
You are waiting for peace to reign on the island of Paradis?
I sympathize with you.
The world will just get even tighter, that's all.
Nothing will change, you will continue to kill each other.
I am grateful for the warning.
I myself had similar suspicions.
But most importantly,
it's important to know your place.
We don't need Hizuru's technology.
Flying boats and shipping.
We can just decide that they are too difficult to refuse them.
And the spark of the wave will go out.
Listen,
it's most important to know your place.
Do you understand?
Flock!
Flock!
Where are you?
Where are you from Zmabit?
Amen.
Flock!
Where have you been?
Why are you shouting?
We were chasing the Titan transporter.
They, together with the armored one,
fled across the sea in flight.
We need to hurry, or we will miss them.
We need a flying boat right now.
Tell Zmabit to prepare for the flight.
What are you talking about?
Aren't you chasing the transporter?
It's clear that they fled to the south.
They...
killed Zhanna and Yanyan Kapon!
Armin!
The flying boat is over there!
Flock!
Hurry up and bring the mechanics from Zmabit!
Stop!
Stop!
Das!
Samel!
What are you doing here?
Is this a bomb?
Hurry up and take them off!
We need a flying boat to catch up with the rest of Marley's forces!
Guys, calm down.
To be honest,
there is a suspicion that you have crossed over to Marley.
And that's why you need a flying boat
to try to stop the Hull of Earth.
That's what we were told.
What the hell do we need this for?
Exactly!
If we stop the Hull of Earth, then what will happen to the island?
And the truth is,
we are finally going to be saved.
And you definitely won't be able to put the island in danger again.
Of course!
Okay.
I wouldn't know what to do if you were traitors.
Then hurry up!
Take the bombs off!
But you know,
I was afraid that you might be able to stop Aaron
from killing people, even if they were all enemies.
There were such thoughts.
What's going on?
I disconnected the detonator.
Now,
if Floch lets the mechanics off Zumaabit,
then we will somehow
land everyone on the assembled flying boat
and fly away.
If everything goes well,
then the blood will not be spilled in vain.
You didn't think anything was strange, did you?
If you know that the enemy is running south,
it will be faster along the railroad,
much faster than on a horse that needs rest.
So why did they need to be hidden?
No.
It's better to put out the detonator
as soon as possible.
It didn't work!
It didn't work!
It didn't work!
It didn't work!
Floch!
Damn it!
Kill her!
Do you think I'll die just like that?
Mrs. Kiyomi!
We've been attacked!
Mikasa!
Armin!
Kony!
They've defeated Eldia!
Kill them!
They're going to launch the thunder spears into the windows!
Run to the basement!
Here it is.
It won't end until the last Egeris is down,
Mrs. Mikasa!
Azumabe, come here!
Let's sit in the basement!
Follow me if you want to live!
Hey!
Das!
Stop!
Armin!
Out of my way!
Samal!
Das!
Hurry up and blow up the boat!
Come on!
Samal!
Hey!
You're traitors!
Kony!
We've been dreaming together!
To break the ground...
...and eat meat.
Damn it!
Why did it come to this?
How are we going to get caught?
They're going to kill us in some time!
Trust me!
As long as we're safe,
they're going to break the ground!
They ran into the basement!
Get more explosives!
They want to get into the basement!
Where do they come from?
No!
No way!
What?
It didn't work after all.
Why is it always like this?
It's impossible for people to take love to violence.
Yes?
Captain?
Take the ashes!
Das!
Get up!
Das!
Das!
Get up!
Armin!
Stop it!
Don't!
Armin!
Traitor!
Why?
Aren't we friends?
Yes, we're friends!
But...
I...
Someone has to take it.
No, stop!
Someone has to get their hands dirty
in someone else's blood!
No!
