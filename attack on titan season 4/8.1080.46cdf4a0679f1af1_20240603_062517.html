The battle is over. I don't have the strength left to finish off Reiner.
We have to go. Let's go home.
Yes, sir.
We have to go. Let's go home.
Yes, sir.
I don't have the strength left to finish off Reiner.
We have to go. Let's go home.
Reiner, see you later.
Defend the enemy ship. Use the rest of the explosives.
Finally. They're retreating.
It's all over.
They're retreating?
Gabi!
Eren Yeager!
Gabi!
You won't get away! I'll finish you off!
The battle is over. I don't have the strength left to finish off Reiner.

Yes, sir.
We have to go. Let's go home.
It's all over.
They're retreating.
It's all over.
They're retreating?

THE END
THE END
The whole place is covered in mud.
The whole place is covered in mud.
The whole place is covered in mud.
It's like I'm out of a grave.
It's like I'm out of a grave.
Eren.
Captain.
Captain.
Open it.
The Great God Eren...
The Great God Eren...
You won't die killing with your allies.
You won't die killing with your allies.
Is there anything behind it?
Nothing.
I don't know the Puish soldiers
in Seeitt Empire.
I think my position is clear.
Tsk.
And your face.
The abandoned underground city was crushed in about the same way.
You are now at their level.
Be happy.
Everything turned out the way you wanted.
Don't let them in!
Hit at least one of them!
All aboard!
Report that they have nothing to knock down the ship!
Jean!
You go too.
I'll cover the back.
I count on you, commander Lobov!
I asked you not to call me that.
The garrison no longer needs anyone.
Kyiv officers too!
Jean!
Grab on!
Is everyone on board?
There is no front line yet.
There was no loss.
Six people died.
I see.
Damn!
The enemy has much more losses.
This is victory!
The first battle of the new Eldian Empire
is over with victory!
Enjoy!
So, we almost remember the dead comrades!
The first battle.
And how many more are waiting for us ahead?
How many more do we have to kill?
Well, this time we survived.
I feel sorry for the dead comrades,
but it would be more painful to lose you, guys.
It hurts, Balde.
It's not easy to hug in these iron bars.
Who would say, Jean?
Only an idiot will take care of the life of Keborodyan.
I'm not a fool.
Jean!
Only an idiot will take care of the life of Keborodyan.
So it's you, Balde!
What?
He's right.
Why grow what you can't eat?
What?
By the way, will they give us food?
Wait until we get to the island.
And we have a command.
Gabi!
Gabi!
Wait!
Gabi!
That's it.
Stop it.
The enemy is already high in the sky.
Don't chase after him.
You understand yourself.
But Sophia...
Her body flattened the debris that flew to the building.
We were a step away from her.
Uda was trying to get her out.
But he panicked.
The crowd...
The crowd didn't stop.
And in the end, they broke his skull.
Those two guards...
They scolded me.
For breaking into the square.
They warned me.
They wanted to save the poor Yelda.
And then...
A woman shot them from the roof.
I was born in the Yelda internment zone.
All the citizens couldn't stand me.
I managed to endure everything here.
But that's why I kept trying.
I wanted to prove to the world that the Yelda people are good.
I believed that one day I would be proud of this Yelda bandage.
And that's why I kept working on myself.
But now it's all over.
After all, this ghetto...
It was the house where my dear people lived.
How can I forgive those who destroyed my house?
So what now?
Are you going to stop me?
Zeyka was killed right in front of us.
We couldn't do anything.
We don't even know what we deserve.
Tell me, Rainer.
Why did my mom...
The giant burned that day?
They destroyed their house too.
Before that, our enemies were attacked by the Marley warriors.
Many died.
And now they're taking revenge.
Did you see it yourself?
No.
I didn't see it.
I didn't see it either.
By the way, they're the demons of the island that threaten to destroy the world.
Do you remember what we were taught?
They deserve to die, because they've always been killing other people.
We're not like them.
Rainer, we're not like them.
We're not like them.
We're not like them.
We're not like them.
Rainer, we're not like them.
We're not like them.
We're not like them.
We're not like them.
Lime squad, now everyone's together.
Report to the command.
We can go.
Yes, sir!
Hey!
Kid!
I got you!
It's...
...still holding on!
Gabby!
What were you thinking?
I think it's this chicken.
If I press it...
Gabby, you don't want to get on the ship, do you?
I want to kill all the demons!
They'll kill you themselves, you fool!
Tell Mom and Dad...
...Rainer and the others...
...that I fought to the end.
If I don't do it...
...my actions will inspire those who will survive.
Falco! Gabby!
What are you two doing?
Brother...
Goodbye, Falco.
You...
You've always been a good guy.
You have to save Gabby.
Don't let her share my fate.
Falco!
Falco!
What are you doing?
I'll be the next heir of the armored man!
I think I heard something.
Hey! Shut up!
Scream louder! We won!
Hey!
By the way, where's Lobov?
It's strange. He was supposed to be back.
Sasha!
Bastards!
Rakutei! Soga!
What are you doing here?
Rakutei! Soga!
Sasha! Hey!
Don't turn it off!
Hey!
Don't scream like that.
It's not...
...already...
...already too soon.
Pull the trigger! We need to close the wound!
Yes, sir!
Sasha!
We'll be there soon!
No, sir.
Zhanna!
Those two came here with the help of UPM Lobov.
Get him out of here!
Don't you mind?
If we throw the children overboard...
...will it break the cycle?
What's wrong with Brown and Grayson?
It's just that...
...they ran off somewhere and never came back.
Vic.
Commander.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Commander.
I remembered...
...that Marley soldier...
...who lured us with Goliath into that trap.
I saw her...
...three years ago...
...after Reiner returned from the island.
She was part of the first reconnaissance fleet.
On that missing ship?
Yes.
And still...
...she doesn't give a shit.
Hey.
How long are you going to be carrying this shit?
What?
People seem to like it.
I'm sorry.
And these guys are fucking crazy.
Hands off, demon!
We haven't lost yet!
The will of Mr. Zika will be done by his comrades!
Gabby, enough!
What do we do with her, Joan?
True Ildians wish you to die soon!
When you kill me...
...tell it to your master!
I'll take you to him.
Tell him what you told me.
How did you find out about her?
The thing is...
...that I was personally interested in this girl.
After all, she...
...was the successor of Zika.
Gabby, Falco!
Where are you from?
Where?
And you, Mr. Zika?
You're alive!
But you've been captured by demons!
Who are these kids?
They killed Lobov...
...and took advantage of his UPM.
And this girl shot Sasha.
I'm afraid we can't save her anymore.
You're next, Unyankupun.
Yes, Mrs. Hanji!
Well...
...everything went according to your plan, Zika Yiger.
Most of it, yes.
But there are some calculations.
Mr. Zika!
What are these kids?
Calculations...
Yelena!
But you were supposed to have neutralized her jaw and the transporter!
It's because of you our comrades died!
I'm sorry.
I lured them into that trap.
But something went wrong.
Because these two got out...
...probably had to throw more stones.
This clown Nada was starting to get out of control.
Right, boar?
Don't look so scary, Levi.
If I get wet, I'll clean you up later.
You played convincingly yourself.
At some point, I even believed that you would kill me.
I'm one of those people who leaves the most delicious for later.
I want to enjoy it as much as possible.
We cut off the command of the eagle.
Only led them to the port and the main fleet.
We won a little time.
Time before the moment when the whole world will go to war on Paradise Island?
Every time you were captured by the enemy, we risked our lives for your salvation.
No matter how much it cost.
And knowing this fact, you still surrendered to your plan.
You arranged everything so that we have no choice.
You completely trusted us.
But we lost our trust in you.
But thanks to that, we have a giant founder and a giant with royal blood.
These are noble sacrifices.
They will bring freedom to the deities.
They were not in vain.
Sasha...
...died.
The
Cunha
She said something before she died.
She said...
...meat.
I took some meat from the officer's stock here.
Don't worry.
As soon as we return to our land, we will breed a lot of cows and sheep.
Aaron...
You understand that Sasha died only because you dragged us into your plan.
