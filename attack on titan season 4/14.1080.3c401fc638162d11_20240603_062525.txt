Why did you save me?
It's nothing.
There was no special reason.
I killed your dear friend.
I also knocked down the guard with a stone.
It's not Falka's fault.
Just kill me alone.
We won't kill you.
But you really want to.
I don't want to.
Kill this, kill that.
You only have death on your mind.
Right in the right spot.
Kill this, kill that.

Volover Kick
Don't worry about the Hanje and the others, they're just being transported to another place.
Eren, we wanted to talk to you ourselves.
Why did you decide to attack Marley all by yourself?
Did Zeke and Lena actually turn you in their own direction?
I don't know.
I'm free.
Whatever I do, whatever I choose, it's all up to my own will.
And after meeting with Yelena, did you also do it your own way?
Exactly.
No, you're the one who did it.
You're the one who did it.
You're the one who did it.
Exactly.
No, you're the one who did it.
You're not one of those who would set up the attack on innocent people and children, let alone in an enemy country.
You cared more about us than anyone else.
You saved my life in that mountain hut and tied this scarf to me, because you're kind.
I told you to keep your hands on the table.
In Liberium, we talked to Zeke.
From eye to eye, like brother to brother.
Zeke knows more about the Titans than all of Marley together.
Armin, are you still going to Kenny?
Are you sure your own will is leading there?
What are you talking about?
If a person creates memories, then part of you has turned into Bertelda.
Into the enemy soldier who is in love with another enemy soldier.
Armin, your brain is defeated by Bertelda.
It's you who's controlling the enemy.
Eren, what are you...
Nikasa, you too.
The Ackerman clan was created as defenders of the king Eldia.
In the hut, when your life was hanging on the fence, you heard my order.
Fight.
Surely, at that moment, your instinct woke up.
You were led astray that I am your master, who needs to be protected.
No.
No? What no?
It's not a coincidence.
It's because it was you, Eren.
I was able to become strong, only because it was you.
Apparently, after waking up, the Ackermans have sudden headaches.
They arise when the original personality tries to resist the compulsion to protect the master.
Doesn't it remind you of anything?
No.
In short...
No.
I...
Your mouth is created to forget yourself and only obey orders.
That is, you are slaves.
Enough, Eren!
Do you know what I hate the most in the world?
Unreliable people.
In other words, scouts.
Eren!
Only her appearance drove me out of myself.
I finally understood why.
It was unbearable for me to look at a slave, who never resists and only obediently obeys orders.
Long ago, since childhood.
Mikasa, I hated you with all my heart.
Eren!
How dare you!
Mikasa...
You see, all your life you only did what followed the call of the blood of the Ackermans.
No.
And there is nothing else in you.
To be continued...
Jäger!
Everything is fine.
Hey, Armin.
We've never fought with you before, have we?
Can you guess why?
Because...
Enough.
We can't have an honest fight with you!
Enough already.
As I said at the beginning, if you show where Zika is, we won't have to fight.
So go with us calmly.
Take them away.
Yes, sir!
And the girl who killed Sasha, too.
So, what did you want to say?
Your desire for freedom?
Freedom to hurt Mikasa?
Speak!
The slave on the leash is dead!
Who did you call a slave?
Let's go.
Where?
Where it all started.
Shiganshin.
Bullshit.
There is another shit that can be fed to the titan.
What are you talking about?
We'll pass the beast Zika to someone else.
Even if we catch one of these Jägerists, turn him into a giant and feed him Zika.
I don't know if Aaron is really dancing to Zika's tune,
but I think he's going to be a great leader to this group of cowards.
So tell Pixis.
Go.
Captain, are you serious?
If I tear his hands and legs off, I'll have to make up with my grandfather.
Do you like the book?
It's interesting, given that I've read it seven times.
You must have gotten more interested in our much more interesting conversation.
Do you want to read the book seven times on your own?
By the way, do you have any wine left?
We've been sitting here for a month, and there's no drop left.
Oh, well.
You've come up with a terrible torture.
Continue reading.
As you command, boss.
If Pixis doesn't answer, I'll cut off his beard.
High on the trees, the forest surrounds 30 soldiers armed to the teeth.
If he turns into a titan, he won't get away alive from here.
After all, this bearded bastard was our enemy.
Once we've figured it out, there's no reason to leave the hostage with his hands and legs.
How many years have passed, Erwin?
But I'll finally fulfill the oath I made that day.
You didn't die in vain.
And now I can prove it.
Spirit Loader
What was that?
My spiky body ate me alive!
Me too!
I don't have anything.
What's going on?
I feel like someone just hit me.
Really?
Well, you did it, Zik.
It's time to say goodbye, Captain.
Such a caring commander as you
won't hurt any innocent subordinates
who have just slightly grown up.
Wine?
Who took the drink for the mission?
Well, Captain, it's Marley's rarity
that only the guards got.
There must be at least a little joy.
We have tea.
Captain!
Here we are.
Good, you can take it.
Damn it!
It was Zik's spinal-brain fluid
when it was mixed in there.
But no one made it up.
Or was it a lie?
Damn it!
Quick!
And they move unusually.
Zik tried too!
Varys!
Are you still in there?
Like everyone else?
So they parted.
We couldn't trust each other.
Soon all the forces of the world
will gather on this island.
And you don't understand what that means.
You have the power.
You have the time.
You have the choice.
It was these mistakes, Levi,
that were your mistake.
But if I had told you
about my true intentions,
you still wouldn't understand.
Right, Aaron?
Only we can understand that.
As soon as I get out of the woods,
I'll be almost next to you.
Interesting.
Do you remember where and when
we were supposed to meet?
Aaron?
Go!
Damn you, Derry!
Not again!
Where are you?
Where are you hiding, Levi?
Over there.
What happened to your precious subordinates?
You didn't kill them, did you?
Poor thing!
Huh?
Svetka?
That's enough, you bastard!
You were the only one who needed
to sit and read.
Why did you think
you could get away from me?
You thought that if you turned my people
into giants,
I wouldn't be able to kill my comrades?
You can't even imagine
how many of your friends' corpses
we've been through!
Damn you!
Go!
Hello, bearded man.
Look at you.
You're so smelly, dirty
and ugly.
You're a piece of shit.
But don't worry,
I'm not going to kill you.
At least not now.
As you know,
the killing of Commander Zakhle
destabilized the situation
in the army and society behind the scenes.
But you have nothing to do with it.
109th Cadet Corps
as planned
will carry out exercises
to protect Shiganshina
from the attack of the giants.
Is everyone clear?
Yes, sir!
Is it our time to learn
how to cut the titan's heads with swords?
They won't attack anyway.
Our enemies are people
on the other side of the wall.
It would be better if they taught us
how to shoot from a gun
As father says.
Times have changed.
Instructor Sadis
is stuck in the past.
If LDE has hope,
it is that the government will capture the Yegerists.
Surma!
They will hear you!
But you also think so.
Probably everyone wants
LDE to be headed by Aaron Yeager,
a strong leader who is capable of making
exceptional decisions.
What?
Hanje?
Long time no see,
Mr. Instructor.
Sorry for the suddenness,
but we are capturing this military unit.
Yegerists?
I think that's what they call us.
Now you will follow
the orders of the Yegerists.
Yegerists?
Looks like you know
your position well, Flock.
And if you think
that if you don't swing
your weapon in front of your nose,
nobody will listen to
such suckers as you.
You got it!
Flock!
I missed.
I wanted to shoot my leg
and simplify the conversation.
What conversation?
No, it has nothing to do with you.
We don't need old people
whose only merit is
stubbornness.
Now,
friends of Kadets,
your era begins!
We, the Yegerists,
vowed to give our hearts
to save L.D.,
who is now on the verge of death.
And we did it not for the sake
of the outdated military organization,
but for the sake of the entire people of our island.
If you remain loyal
to the rebel army,
you will only be helplessly watching
how your country is trampled by enemies from the outside.
Answer me!
Who are you?
Those who will live
together with the leader of L.D.,
Aaron Yeger?
Or those who will die
together with Kit Shadis
and his old ways?
We will give our hearts
for the future of L.D.!
Great!
Now, show your resolve!
Beat Kit Shadis
until he can't stand on his feet!
What?
He is the embodiment of the threshold
under which we must get rid of.
Kick him out!
Those who can't
go to jail!
Know the measure, Folk!
Stop this madness!
Hanje,
let all the yellow-tongues
fall, they will still not cope!
Adios!
Well done!
I'm welcoming you all in our ranks!
So, now lead us
where Zika is holding.
Commander Hanje...
Hey...
come on.
but the
Well, are you feeling better?
Hey, stop!
Look, don't move.
The rope from the explosive of the thunderbolt is wrapped around your neck.
One wrong move and your stomach will explode,
which will at least tear you in half.
It's hard to be immortal in such moments.
But I don't feel sorry for you at all.
You have trampled the lives of my subordinates.
It's also part of your plan to cry in the puddle of your saliva.
Shut up!
You will turn into a titan if you are not crushed like this!
Where are my glasses?
What? How should I know?
You don't need them anyway.
Great, Zig!
You've already learned to throw the ball well.
Do you want to become a baseball player?
It won't work, Xavier.
I have a mission.
I have a mission.
I have a mission.

Confirmation.
Dear heart of the image and confused memories.
What will wait further?
What leads to the fulfillment of its purpose?
Next, the only salvation.
