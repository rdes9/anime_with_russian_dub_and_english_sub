If you open it gently and pull it closer
It will reach you, it will reach you, it will reach you, it will reach you for sure
Pull it closer, pull it closer
It will reach you, it will reach you, it will reach you, it will reach you for sure
If it's not a dream, it's meaningless
That's why it's so far away
This is a tradition which preserves the balance of fight and death
In the world of the ninja, that is friendship
The third challenge is a fight for life
In the name of the village and for your dream
Hmph!
Well, he sure convinced me
I'm ready for anything
Just tell me what to do, I can handle anything you throw at me
Hmph!
Very well!
Now listen closely, I'm going to tell you exactly what you'll all be doing on the third exam
Lord Hokage, before you do, please allow me to tell you my word
So be it
There's something I would like all of you to know
I would like all of you to do one more exam
Uh, we have to do a preliminary exam before the real exam
Huh?
What?
A what?
Preliminary?
Just what do you mean by that?
I'm sorry, sensei, excuse me, but I really don't get the point
What's this preliminary all about?
Why can't we just move on to the third exam?
Uh, well, you see, the first and second exams might have been too easy
The fact is, we didn't expect there to be so many of you to still be here
According to the rule for the tuning exam, a preliminary round can be held at any stage
to reduce the number of candidates remaining
But, is that fair?
It's just that at this stage we have to speed things up a bit
As Lord Hakage said, a lot of important guests are coming
We can't afford to waste their time
They've come to see only the best
So if there are any of you who feel like you're not in a good physical condition,
that's your chance to...
Talk about not being in a good physical condition
That's probably not good for him
Sorry about that
As I was saying, any of you who don't feel up to this,
you know, it's the time to go out
The preliminary round will be starting immediately
Come on! I mean, right now!
Just finished barely surviving the last exam!
Will we get a break?
Man, I'm so tired
Hey, what do we eat?
Narrowing until!
There's only half the population!
It's all the faster way
But I am in the game to the end
No matter what!
I gave my word as if!
Oh, yeah
The winners will be determined by one-on-one combat and sudden death
So like I said, if there's anyone who doesn't feel up to it,
now's the time to raise your hand
Does he really think any of you should...
Sasuke!
Waves of pain
That comes sooner or later
Oh, no, I knew it
Sasuke, listen to me
You've got to quit
You've been with the ever-setting temple for Ujimaru
And it's getting worse
It's that mark he put on you, isn't it?
Mark?
You can't deny it, Sasuke
I just gave you my goodbye gift
Sasuke, you're going to be looking for me
You're thirsty for my power
It looks like there's no one left
It looks like there's only one left
Please, stop
Please, Sasuke, quit now
I don't know, I'm scared
Sakura
It's just as I feared
What do we do?
We take a lot of these and hand them over to Pratop
and let them keep them locked up
We have to keep that seal under control
Oh, and he's trying to keep them locked up all of this, huh?
You really think so?
You'll forget he's of the Uchiha clan
I don't care who the heck he is
If he stays, it's the future of everyone
Don't you see it? He gets stronger
So does the curse mark
That thing is beating off his chakra
It's the one who chases after the one who bears it
It's incredible that he's still standing
By now, he should be dead
Lord Hokage
Come on, you know we're still alive
We are in no condition to keep on fighting
Shut up, Sakura
You think I'm blind?
Will you please be quiet?
You think I don't see the suffering you're going through?
That's enough, Sakura
Sorry, I can't let you do it to yourself
I'm going to tell them about that mark
Then maybe you'll be...
What the...
Okay, you got me, I'm out
But...
Kabuto!
Kabuto Yakushi from the Leaf Village?
Okay, you can go on and step back
Gotcha
Kabuto!
Hold on a second, you can't leave!
I don't get this, what's going on?
You're making a noise
Oh, Naruto, I'm sorry
But my body is just too beat up
I can't handle it
Kabuto Yakushi
I can't handle it
The fact is, every single orientation you make
does something to the sound of your left ear
I've had no hearing at all in my left ear
And now I have to put my life on the line?
To fight again, right away without a break?
I can't do it
Seems to me I've seen that one before
If memory serves, this isn't the first time
you talk out before a battle
What kind of games are you playing?
Anko?
Right
Kabuto Yakushi
Says he's failed six times in a row
What do you have on his back?
His time at the academy was not what you'd call impressive
Average grades
Took him a four-year contract before he got his graduation exam
As far as the missions he's carried out since then
There's been two C-Ranks and 14 D-Ranks
It's not exactly a battle record, right? I don't know how
However
Go on
There's something before his time at the academy
Do you remember the child?
The one who was found after the Battle of Kiko
Kiko, he's the only survivor
I remember the story
It was said a small boy was found dead on the battlefield
He was barely alive
And back by a child from the medical school
You're saying this is that boy?
Kabuto, what do you think you're doing anyway?
Have you forgotten about tomorrow's orders?
I'm leaving it all up to you
What's the problem?
For some of the young adults
It should be no trouble
This is your chance to prove yourself a hero
After all, you've always wanted to take my place, haven't you?
Go for it
You may be a loved one, Karatimaru
But be careful you don't push it too far
Thanks for the advice, I'll keep it in mind
Sorry, Naruto
Sorry, Sasuke
I wish I could stick around and play a little longer
But if I did that
The old me might disturb them
Can't have that
Might blow my cover
Wouldn't be much use as a spy after that
Besides, I've already done my job
With you here looking after things
You only make me do more, Lord Karatimaru
Guess I'll just have to save my fun for later
Until we meet again, Sasuke
Oh, and you too, of course, Naruto
Now then
Does anybody else want to quit?
I can't let this go on
I have to tell them
Don't you even think of telling them about this work
Look
I don't get what you're trying to prove
Am I supposed to just stand by and watch you tear yourself apart?
I can't bear to watch it
Then don't watch it, but stay out of it
This has nothing to do with you
I told you before
What I am is an avenger
For me, this is something far more than just an exam
Whether I become a chunin or not is less than nothing to me
Am I as strong as I can be?
All I want is the answer to that
Am I as strong as I can be?
All I want is the answer to that
I can only buy my own winnings
Strongest, best
My name is Gaaru, from the desert
Hey you, over here
What's your name?
Accept it
You have no chance against me
You're much weaker
For the moment, you know
But if a champion like we meet again in combat
Promise me
We won't run away
And the best of the best
Are all here
This is my path
Not you or anyone can change that
Oh Sasuke
Man, you don't know what you're doing
What are you biting your head off for, you idiot?
It's just what you can't do
Not at all
You're one of the ones I want to fight the most
I'm still concerned about what Aratimaru said
Allow the boy to continue with the exam for now and we'll see what happens
Lord no, Lord Hokage
However, at the first sign of a curse mark
Or his heart getting out of control
Lord, step in and stop it
Right
Right
As you wish
All right
We'll now begin the preliminary round
This round will consist of one-on-one
individual contact
For a subtle intensity
It's not an exercise
There are 20 remaining
So that means there will be 10 matches left
The surviving candidates will move on to the third test
As for the rules, there are none
You will fight until one dies
The teacher will not surrender or physically be unable to continue the contest
Naturally, those who lose in are urged to give up immediately
And leave with a fatal outcome
Furthermore, as a judge
I'm given a certain amount of free will to continue the matches
In the event of an obvious outcome
Stop the fight to avoid unnecessary casualties
Now it's time to find out what has been chosen for you
Open the panel
The names of each pair of opponents are chosen by accident
Before each match
The names will appear on this plate
That's it
Let's begin
In a moment the names of the first two opponents will appear
Oh my God
Yuro Akado vs Sasuke Uchiha
They're wasting time
I couldn't ask for anything more
No! Why did it have to be Sasuke?
All right now, those whose names have been drawn
Come forward
You have been chosen for the first match
Yuro Akado and Sasuke Uchiha
Are there any objections?
Not here
No
Well, I...
All I can do now is watch
You better win, Sasuke
If you ever hope to take me down
Something's wrong
He's acting strangely
Could it be the printer's mark?
Sasuke! Good luck!
Now we just relax and see what happens
The paintball doesn't go away
That printing machine is torturing him
All right then
Let's begin the first match
Okay, everyone other than the two opposing candidates
Now clear the area and move to the other level
Sasuke!
Sasuke
Don't use your Siren Gun
So you know about him?
If that mark on your neck comes out of control
Your life could be in danger
I'm aware of that
Just to let you know, if it gets to that point
I like to step in and stop and fight
If it gets to that point, I like to step in and stop and fight
Good luck
Stop and fight
This thing, it seems to be related to my chakra
Got to try
Using the rest of my chakra
Siren Gun!
Sasuke! Stop using your Siren Gun! Don't do it!
Every time I use my chakra
This thing gets a little stronger
It gains a little more control over me
I've got to fight it without using my chakra
And even my own skills are face
Maybe I can make him laugh until he's dead
The thing is, Sasuke
You're always going to be a disaster for you
Whatever
Let's get on with this
Watch yourself, Sasuke
Don't push it
If you're ready, let the match begin
So I'm ready
So am I
Already?
Hey, got him!
Really?
What's happening?
Almost there
Almost there
Almost there
Suddenly gone
Sasuke! No!
Sasuke!
What the?
What are you doing?
You're just noticing it now
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!

Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
assaske!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
But I don't. They'll call the magic, give Yoroi the victory.
Every time I use the Chakra, the seal gains strength.
The purpose of being here is lost.
I've got to find a way. I can't let it end like this.
Next time.
Pussy Browse and Jealousy.
Lions Burrow's Undefeated.
