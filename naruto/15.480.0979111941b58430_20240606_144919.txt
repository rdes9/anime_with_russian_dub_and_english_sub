Naruto
We cry for no one, we cry for no one
Our present is
The pain, hold on key, the heart, hold on key
The shadow, hold on key
The breath, hold on key
The shadow, hold on key
The shadow, hold on key
The fight, hold on key
The love, hold on key
The end, hold on key
On the way
We cry for no one, we cry for no one
Our present is
The pain, hold on key, the heart, hold on key
The Shadow
Damn!
From which side is he attacking?
Clones?
Where is the real one?
It's useless to try to keep an eye on me
I can't be caught
Shadow Clone Technique!
Don't!
The essence of this technique is movements
For which I use reflections in mirrors
Which reflect only me
If you look at my speed
You practically don't move at all
As I thought
So this technique is passed on
Inheritance
Passed on inheritance?
Like my Serengan
But then...
Yes
Even for me it is impossible to copy this technique
And there is absolutely no way to oppose it
Damn!
How?
What is it?
Do I have to die?
Despite the fact that I have a dream
Which needs to be realized
To make all the villages recognize my power
My dream is to become Hokage!
Dream?
Please don't reproach
You have your dreams, I have mine
I want to protect my dear man
Working for him, fighting for him
I want to realize his dreams
Fight for that person
I want to fulfill that person's dream
That is my dream
For this I will become a Shinobi
I will kill you!
Battle at zero visibility
Serengan's collapse
Sasuke-kun! Naruto!
Don't lose to this guy!
Stop it, Sakura
Don't provoke
Even if there is a way to cope with this technique
Two teenagers can't do it
What does it mean?
They don't have the psychological strength
To kill their own hearts
And take the life of another person
These young people know very well
The suffering of the Shinobi way
They are different from each other
Exactly
In peaceful villages like yours
They don't grow real Shinobis
Because you can't save the most valuable
experience of killing
To become a real Shinobi
Then...
Then...
What should we do?
If we go in the direction of Naruto and Sasuke
Tatsuna-san will be in danger
If we use the technique of shadow clones
I will only waste the extra chakra
And if so...
I'm sorry
But...
I have to...
Finish it all without delay
Serengan!
Serengan?
And you are no different from originality
What?
Sasuke!
Although you are trying to threaten with words
You are no different from originality
And you...
You are still afraid of Serengan, aren't you?
The secret of Shinobi's skill is
Not to show the opponent the same thing several times
Better thank me
You are the only one who will see this eye for the second time
And there will be no third time
Even if you can beat me for a while
You can't resist against Haku
Kakashi-sensei won't be able to beat him
Is this boy so strong?
I've been teaching him since childhood
All kinds of fighting techniques
I'll teach him
I taught him all the techniques that I know
And then
and improved those that he already had.
And as a result, no matter how incredibly difficult situations he was in,
he always achieved success.
Heartless, fearless before the face of death,
he became a killing machine called the Shinobi.
Moreover, his skill surpassed even mine.
His overwhelming abilities are passed on through inheritance.
I created a high-class murder weapon,
absolutely unlike the garbage that constantly sticks to you.
I'm not one of those who starts shivering after one unsuccessful attempt.
I will try again and again!
Shadow clones technique!
Enough already!
What the hell is this?
Even though it's not much,
I'm starting to see traces of his movements.
Just a little bit more!
Shadow clones technique!
Enough already!
Just a little bit more!
Shadow clones technique!
Don't you understand that you're trying too hard?
Even though I see traces of his movements, I can't catch up with his speed.
The water is splashing.
But what if it wasn't water?
All right, next time I'll try again.
Garbage, even collected in a pile, can't handle Haku.
He's the greatest tool.
No, nothing is more boring than bragging about people.
Well, I guess I'll start.
All right, wait a minute.
Let's chat a little more.
I want to brag about something else.
What?
I want to brag about something else.
What?
In the previous battle, I wasn't just beaten up like an idiot.
It's over.
It's over.
Haku was hiding nearby to watch the nuances of the battle.
Haku is very considerate.
Usually, seeing one technique at a time, he constantly improves in his ability to resist it.
I took the time to let you copy my technique.
Haku.
I'll tell you one thing.
The same technique doesn't work on me twice.
However...
Nimpo.
The technique of hiding in the fog.
The technique of hiding in the fog.
This is...
What is this?
What is this impenetrable thick fog?
Zero visibility.
Sensei!
Sakura, stay close to Tadzuna-san.
Tadzuna-san.
Yes. Now I just have to believe in Sasuke and Naruto, as well as in Kakashi-sensei.
Sakura!
Tadzuna-san, don't ever leave me!
Yes, I understand.
I understand, Zabuda-san.
I'm finishing it.
The technique of hiding in the fog!
This is impenetrable.
The technique of the element of fire.
The element of fire.
You're doing everything too slowly.
Okay, I think I'm starting to catch up with you in time.
This fog of Kirigakure is too thick.
Then Zabuda himself won't see anything.
You hit them well.
As expected of Kakashi-sensei.
His eyes are closed.
However, the next time you see me, it will be your end.
You overestimate your Siren Gun.
What?
You thought you knew everything ahead, but...
What?
What?
Do you see the future?
Yes, you will die.
But as a result, this prediction did not come true.
Kakashi, you can't see my future or my thoughts at all.
Your Siren Gun is just a deceitful means that makes the opponents think so.
People who have the Siren Gun have two abilities.
People who have the Siren Gun have two abilities.
The view that penetrates into the essence and the hypnotic view.
These two abilities together allow you to conduct techniques.
And you only create the impression that you can see the future.
First, you start to imitate my movements with the view that penetrates into the essence.
This is a way of copying the form.
This immediately caused confusion in me.
You caught every throbbing of my consciousness.
Moreover, you as if turned yourself into me and thus began to read the voice of my heart.
This is a way of copying consciousness.
You can't beat me, give up!
I will make sure that you will never open your monkey's mouth again!
Thus, you successfully picked up the moment that my confusion reached its peak.
What?
And you began to set up clever traps.
Me?
With the help of the hypnotic vision, you used the Genzutsu
and imposed on me in advance the seal that I had to bind, you repeated them.
This is your way of copying the technique.
Water element.
The technique of the Great Waterfall.
No!
If so, then the conversation is simple.
First, you need to hide in the fog and thereby neutralize your penetrating gaze.
Damn!
The guard is late because of the fog.
If I close my eyes and observe the distance, I will become unreachable for your hypnotic gaze.
Why is that?
After all, in this way, you yourself lose your ability to see.
Have you forgotten?
I can catch the target only by sound.
After all, I am a genius of quiet hoops.
My movement.
Son of a bitch.
It can't be.
Damn!
Just a little more!
Naruto, can you go on?
Of course!
I'm in perfect order!
He's pretty tired.
And this is the end of the story.
The end of the story.
The end of the story.
The end of the story.
He's pretty tired.
And this is not in vain.
After all, those shadow clones require a lot of chakras.
Thanks to this, I now found his weak spot.
It can't be.
This is just a coincidence.
Naruto, run!
Get out of here and attack from outside!
Got it!
Do you think you can do it?
I won't back down!
Here it is!
Fire element of the technique of the great fire ball!
Fire element of the technique of the great fire ball!
Damn!
Just a little more!
It's okay.
Let's try again.
It's okay!
Perhaps this guy's chakras have limits.
Every time a little.
I won't act like you thought.
I'll start with you.
Sasuke!
Damn!
I haven't had a fight in such dangerous conditions for a long time.
Besides, I'm worried about Sasuke and Naruto.
Be cool.
Think.
Think.
Where is he going to aim now?
Oh no!
Too late.
It's over.
It's over.
It's over.
It's over.
It's over.
It's over.
It's over.
It's over.
It's over.
It's over.
It's over.
It's over.
It's over.
It's over.
It's over.
It's over.
It's over.
It's over.
It's over.
It's over.
It's over.
It's over.
It's over.
It's over.

It's over.
It's over.
It's over.
It's over.
It's over.
It's over.
It's over.
It's over.
It's over.
It's over.
It's over.
It's over.
It's over.
It's over.
It's over.
It's over.
It's over.
It's over.
And yet...
Damn it!
I won't forgive you!
Next time on Unleashed Queen!
