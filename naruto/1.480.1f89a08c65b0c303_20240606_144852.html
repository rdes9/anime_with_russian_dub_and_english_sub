        <pre>12 years ago, a nine-tailed fox appeared with nine tails.
Its tails clashed over the smashing mountains and sending tidal waves crashing the shores.
The ninjas rose up to defend their villages.
Hold the attack! We're waiting for the fourth Hakkaga!
It's getting closer! Don't let him near the village!
One warrior was the nine-tailed fox in the combat.
He sacrificed his life to capture the beast and seal it in the human body.
This ninja was known as the Fourth Hakkaga.
Naruto!
Naruto! Come back! I'll show you!
You've crossed the line, Naruto!
Give it to me!
You're just so pure-hearted to do what I do, aren't you?
You losers! You're the beast! You can't catch me!
You'll never catch me!
It's an emergency, Mr. Hakkaga!
I hope it's not another bummer and not a new trick, Naruto.
It is Naruto again! He climbed onto the Hakkaga's stone image!
And drew all the images!
Naruto! Hold on!
That was too easy!
Oh, you, Naruto!
Where did you come from, Mr. Hakkaga? What are you doing here?
No, what are you doing here? You're supposed to be in class.
I'm at the end of my four-hour tone.
You failed the great mission last time and the time before that.
So now you've got another chance.
Fuck! Because you missed it, Naruto!
Everyone will hear the transformation!
All right, Sakura here. Let's do it.
Transform!
Transform into me?
Good.
Yeah! It worked!
I kicked the bucket!
Sasuke, did you see that?
I kicked the bucket!
I kicked the bucket!
Sasuke, did you see that?
Next, Sasuke Uchiha.
Uh, good.
Next, Naruto Utsumaki Naruto.
This is a total waste of time, Naruto.
We always pick it up because of you.
Like I give a shit.
Naruto, do your best.
Transform!
Take this! It's my sexy Jitsu!
Stop your stupid jokes!
This is your last chance!
This sucks.
You're not going home till you clean up every single drop of paint.
So what? It's not like there's anyone waiting for me at home.
Naruto.
What do you want now, I said?
Well, I was just thinking.
Maybe I should go home.
Well, I was just thinking.
Maybe when you finish your workout,
we can go out and eat some nice food and stuff.
What do you think?
Now that's some serious convention!
I'll have to clean it up time!
Enter Naruto Naruto!
Naruto.
Why would you do that to the Hokage faces?
I mean, you know who the Hokage are, don't you?
Of course I do!
Everybody knows they were the greatest heroes of their time.
The best of the best.
Undisputed ninjas.
And the fourth Hokage, the one that saved the village from the nine tailed fox,
he was the most amazing.
Then why did you?
Because I'm going to be greater than any of them.
Me, Naruto, the next Hokage,
a ninja legend,
then everyone will have to stop smiling at me from the top to the bottom.
Believe it!
By the way, I kind of want to ask you a little favor, Sensei.
You want another bowl?
I want to try your headband.
Come on, please!
Do you want this?
No way!
You can only wear it when you graduate from the academy and become a ninja.
You've got to pass the exam tomorrow.
That is so annoying!
Hey, is that why you took off your goggles?
I want more noodles!
We will now start the final exam.
When your name is called, please enter the test room.
The final test will be done by...
the clone Jitsu.
Ah!
That's what you want to see!
I'm never going to pass!
Suit up!
All right, get ready, Naruto.
You can do it.
Believe in yourself!
Suit up!
Clone Jitsu!
You failed!
Iruka Sensei.
He's on, but he's working hard.
And he did hang in there, in fact.
This is his third try, so you know he really wants to become a ninja.
We could lower the bar a little bit.
Mizuki Sensei.
The other students have created at least three active duplications.
But Naruto only has one.
And look at that. It's pitiful.
I can't rest in peace.
Maybe that's why I flew!
I'm first!
Now I'm a ninja!
I'm proud of you, son.
Congratulations!
Today we're going to have a holiday.
Look at him.
It's the best day ever.
It's the best day ever.
It's the best day ever.
Look at him.
It's that boy.
I heard he was the only one who went down.
Well, it serves him right.
What if he became a ninja?
I mean, this boy...
Shhh.
We're not allowed to talk about that.
All right.
Iruka.
There's something we need to talk about.
Iruka is a strict teacher.
But he's not your enemy.
Then why?
Why only me?
He wants you to be strong
for all his life.
But that will never happen
because he's easy on you.
He's like you even though
no parents, no parents, no parents.
But this time I really want to graduate.
Then I guess I have to go.
It's a secret, but I'm gonna let you know.
Secret?
Surya!
Iruka.
What is it?
Lord Hakage.
I know what you feel.
You grew up just like Naruto.
Without knowing the love of
mother and father,
the war between
mother and father,
the war between
mother and father,
the war between
It's getting close!
Don't let him near the village!
Let me go! My parents are fighting there!
Master Iruka, wake up!
What? What is it?
You need to run to Lord Hakage right away.
It's Naruto.
He stole the secret scroll.
The sealed scroll?
No!
Let's see.
The first one is
multi-channel double-jitsu.
Not this one!
My weakest jitsu!
Lord Hakage, it's not just a prank.
It's a serious crime.
The scroll contains the secrets
of the first Hokage.
The secrets are only known in our village.
If the scroll falls into the wrong hands,
it will be destroyed.
All right.
Bring Naruto here right away.
Yes!
Where would he go?
Now that I've told everyone
what Naruto did, I can elude him.
I'm glad he's gone.
The secret scroll will be mine.
It's all over.
Got me!
You're quick-witted, Sensei.
I learned only one technique.
He's been out here practicing.
I can tell that he put a lot of effort into it.
Listen up, Sensei.
Let me show you this wonderful jitsu.
And then you'll give me an exam.
That's the way one who learned jitsu
and the scroll passed the exam.
Huh? Where'd you get that from?
Mizuki Sensei told me the truth.
He told me where to find the scroll
and this place.
Huh?
Mizuki?
Huh?
Look out!
I see you found it behind me.
So that's the way it is.
I should have known.
Naruto!
Give me the scroll now!
Wait a minute!
What's going on here?
Naruto!
Don't let Mizuki take the scroll!
He contains the magic jitsu
that's dangerous for the whole village.
Mizuki used you to get the scroll
for his own power!
Naruto!
Iruka's just trying to scare you
because he doesn't want you to have the scroll.
Stop lying, Mizuki!
Don't let him trick you, Naruto!
I'll tell you who's lying here.
No, Mizuki!
I'll tell you who's been lying
to you your whole life
since the decree you two years ago.
What decree?
Everyone knows except you.
Iruka's trying to hide it from you even now.
He can do anything to shut you.
Why is this decree?
Why does everyone know about it?
Don't tell him!
It's forbidden!
This decree is to tell you
that inside you is the spirit of the nine-tailed fox.
The fox spirit that killed you, Iruka,
and destroyed our village lives in you.
You are the nine-tailed fox!
Stop it!
They've all just lied.
They've been hiding this from you your whole life.
Didn't it surprise you
how they treated you?
Like dirt!
They hated you for just being alive!
No!
No!
No, Ruto!
That's why you will never become
your own here.
Even your beloved teacher hates you.
Iruka,
Ruto never loved his parents.
He's so isolated from everyone
and doesn't know why.
Most people don't even want to look at him.
How would you feel
if people turned away from you
from everywhere?
That's why he smokes.
He may not smoke,
but he's always thinking about the family
that he's missing.
He's having a heart attack.
Die, Naruto!
Naruto! Get down!
Naruto!
Why?
Because we're the same.
When I lost my parents,
no one cared about me.
They didn't have time for me.
They just forgot about me.
My grades dropped.
I became the class clown.
I just wanted them to see me
and to know my name,
my school.
I couldn't attract their attention
with my success.
So I did easy things
and then I had to pay for them.
It was hard.
I know that's what it feels like
to you, Naruto.
You feel lonely and it hurts inside.
And I'm guilty of that.
I let you down.
I'm sorry.
No one should be so sorry.
No one should be so lonely.
Don't make me laugh!
Iruka always hated you.
He was a wuss
because the nine-tailed fox
killed his parents.
And that beast is not like you.
He'd say anything
just to get you.
Naruto!
Naruto!
You know that he makes up his mind
and nothing will change him.
He's going to use the scroll
to take revenge on the village.
You saw that in his eyes.
Those are the eyes of the beast.
No.
Naruto isn't like that.
That's...
You're a joker.
As soon as I get rid of Naruto
and take the scroll,
I'll be back for you.
I won't let you.
This is not good.
Mizuki has messed it up.
He made Naruto feel so bad
worse than he's ever felt.
It could unleash the power
inside of him.
Naruto, if he continues
to use the scroll,
the seal that locks the fox's spirit
inside of him
may crack
and the beast will be free.
If that happens,
I'm scared for all of us.
Naruto!
Everything Mizuki said was a lie!
Give me the scroll! Hurry!
He's coming after you
Naruto!
It can't be.
How did you know,
Naruto?
How did you know
that it was me,
not Iruka?
Because Iruka
is me.
You're a fool.
Why are you defending
that bastard?
He's the one who wiped out your family.
I don't care about your words.
You're not getting hands on that scroll.
As if you're in my way.
Don't you get it?
Naruto is just like me.
He wants the scroll
to gain power and his own vengeance.
That's how you stop.
He'll pour all his rage into the scroll
and destroy everything.
You're lying.
So true.
Iruka doesn't think
he ever believed me.
He thinks I'm some beast.
Some kind of freak.
That is how you stop.
But that's not
what Naruto is.
He's not like that.
Now, Ruto is one of a kind.
He works hard, puts his whole heart into it.
Sometimes he's actually
the suffering that makes him stronger.
That's what separates him
from the beast.
So you're wrong.
He's nothing like the nine-tailed fox.
He's Naruto
from the village
hidden in the leaves.
You really believe
in this nonsense?
Iruka.
I wanted to sort this out later,
but I changed my mind.
You're finished.
So this is it.
Naruto!
Not bad for a little
bastard.
If you ever play against my sensei,
I will kill you.
What are you talking about?
I can destroy you in one move.
Take you back, you dumb thing.
I'm gonna back you
with a thousand blows.
Let's see you try.
Show me what you can do, nine-tailed fox.
Shadow Force!
Naruto!
Those are not clones.
They're real twins.
He's a master of extremely complex jutsu.
What is this?
Come on, attack!
I'm waiting!
If you're not coming,
they're gonna come after you.
Come on, attack!
I'm sorry, I just carried away.
You okay, Iruka-sensei?
Yeah.
He's amazing.
He wants to surpass all of Hakage.
And I'm starting to believe
he can do it.
Naruto,
come here a minute.
I've got something I want to give you.
I've got something I want to give you.
I've got something I want to give you.
I've got something I want to give you.
I've got something I want to give you.
I've got something I want to give you.
What if we don't find him?
Then we're in trouble.
What if we can't find Naruto?
Not a clue.
This is bad news.
There's no longer any need to worry.
Lord Hakage?
The scroll says Naruto will be back soon.
Sensei, how much longer?
Okay.
You can open your eyes now.
Okay.
Congratulations.
You've graduated.
And to celebrate,
I have a surprise.
We're going out for noodles tonight.
Huh?
You're a ninja!
Be careful.
Naruto,
this is only the beginning.
The road gets tougher
now that you're a ninja.
I told you this was going to be
the end of my life.
So I'll tell you later.
Okay.
To be continued...
To be continued...
To be continued...
Why are you following me?
You want to become the fifth Hokage?
Listen to me, kid.
I don't care if you're Hokage's grandson.
You can't just stand there
and become a ninja.
You'd better get ready to lose.
To dream about being
a Hokage,
you have to be like me.
Next time,
my name is Konohamaru.
