Naruto
We cry for no one. We cry for no one.
We cry for no one.
We cry for no one.
We breathe and run through the darkness.
Fighting and loving each other,
The end is white.
All the way!
We cry for no one.
We cry for no one.
Even Naruto's brothers and the rest are fighting!
And we...
Shinobi is the name of the tool.
Uncle! Uncle Gitya! Open the door!
Let's go together to the bridge!
This time, if we get together, we'll teach this Gato with his ball!
Inari, I stopped fighting a long time ago.
Even your father, who was called a hero, is gone.
If we decide to fight, there will be many victims.
We don't want to lose our loved ones anymore.
No one wants to feel sorry for Asadein anymore.
I don't want to feel sorry for Asadein either.
That's why we have to fight!
If you're a man, live so that you don't have to feel sorry for Asadein.
I love my mom, grandpa, and you very much!
Uncle Gitya! And I love everyone in this city very much!
I realized that it was impossible to protect anyone, being a plex.
Now I understand!
Inari seems to have become a real man.
Do you think it's right to let him go alone like this?
Open the door!
Please, let's all fight together!
Uncle, listen to me!
Why? Why doesn't anyone open the door?
You're strong!
Brother Naruto!
Zabuza, you've gone too far in your tricks.
Your ambitions were too big.
Your fiasco is the murder of Mizukage right after the coup d'etat.
Having sunk to the bottom together with Shaika from several subordinates, you became a ninja fugitive.
Your name quickly became known in the village of Kanon.
You collected money for the ransom, in order to avoid the search for the ninja fugitives and the ransom itself.
Isn't that why you stood up to the side of the victims like Gatou?
Zabuza, do you think that I lived all this time only because of my Seringan?
This time I will show you not a copied one, but my own.
Raikiri!
What kind of chakra is this?
In the hand, visible to the eye!
You're too dangerous!
You're too dangerous!
You're too dangerous!
In the hand, visible to the eye!
You're too dangerous!
Tatsuno-san, whom you were going to kill, is the pride of this country.
And the bridge he wants to build is the hope of the country.
Your ambitions require too many human sacrifices.
And this is not what you should do, Senobi.
What difference does it make?
You fought for your own ideals.
And they will never change.
I'll say it again.
Give up.
Your future is death.
Naruto-kun, please kill me.
Come on, faster.
Why are you hesitating?
I don't understand!
For you, what, the only reason for life in this world is to be strong?
You can get recognition not only by fighting, right?
The day we met in the forest, I thought we looked alike.
I think you can understand why.
Forgive me for making you dirty your hands.
Really?
Is there no other way?
No.
If we met under different circumstances, we could have become friends.
Please fulfill your dreams.
He also had...
Sasuke also had dreams.
Thank you.
You will become strong.
Oh, the incredibly thick fog gradually spread.
Those two?
It looks like they're looking at each other.
I can't see.
Which of them is Kakashi-sensei?
He moved!
I'm sorry, Naruto-kun.
I can't die yet.
I'm sorry, Naruto-kun.
I'm sorry, Naruto-kun.
So this is the end.
What?
Stop!
Uh-oh.
Zabuza-san!
So you're saying my future is death?
You missed again, Kakashi.
No, you can't go to the bridge.
I went around the city, but no one wanted to go with me.
So you can't do anything.
But I'm telling you!
Wait!
You're still a child!
Of course I'm still a child, but I know what it means to fight!
Because I'm the son of my father!
My dear...
Wait, Inari!
Where did he go?
I can't believe it.
The fog suddenly disappeared.
There he is!
What does this mean?
That's the boy in the mask.
I didn't expect him to jump out to cover Zabuza.
This boy is already dead.
Excellent job, Haku.
Kakashi-sensei!
Is he going to chop us both?
It's good that I picked him up.
At the very last moment, give me such a chance!
Haku, I'm sorry.
Tonight I'm leaving the Land of Water.
But I'll definitely come back.
I'll take this land in my own hands.
But for that, I don't need any support, no consolation, no other useless words.
What I really need is...
I know, please don't worry.
I'm Zabuza-San's weapon.
I'll do everything you say.
Take me with you, just like a tool.
Good boy.
I'll...
Take this!
Haku, I'm sorry.
I won't forgive you!
Naruto, stand there and watch.
With this...
I have to fight myself.
Naruto!
Naruto!
It's great that you're okay!
Sakurutian!
Where's Sasuke?
Sasuke!
Where's Sasuke?
Where's Sasuke?
Naruto, where's Sasuke?
Sakura...
Kakashi, there's no time to look around!
I'll go with you too.
So you won't break the order, Sensei.
Sasuke...
Sasuke...
Sasuke...
Sasuke...
Sasuke...
Sasuke...
Sakuruta...
Sakuruta...
Takacchi...
It's cold. It's not Gendutsu anymore, is it?
You don't need to pay attention to me. In such moments you need to cry openly.
I always got 100 points on the tests at the ninja school.
I learned all the rules of the syncope, which are more than 100, and always with pride wrote them in the answers.
On one of the tests there was such a question.
Write down the 25 rules of the syncope, and I, as usual, wrote the answer.
The syncope, no matter what situation it is in, should not show its emotions externally.
It is obliged to put the task above everything.
So that's who the synobes are. How hard it is!
Sasuke Kun!
Why? Why can't I catch up with him?
Damn!
Damn!
You can't beat me in such a state.
What did you say?
You didn't notice?
Real power!
So, what's going on here?
It's time to say goodbye.
Now you can't use both hands.
And you won't be able to tie the seal.
That's it! You seem to have been done well!
You disappointed me, Zabuza!
