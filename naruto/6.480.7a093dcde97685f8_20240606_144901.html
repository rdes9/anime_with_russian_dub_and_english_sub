        <pre>Naruto
We cry for no one, we cry for no one
Our present is
Unleash the pain, unleash the heart, unleash the shadow
Take a breath, run through the darkness
To fight, to love, the end is beautiful
Unleash the pain, unleash the shadow
The target is moving! Follow him!
Over there!
What's your distance, target?
Five meters! I'm ready, just get the signal!
I'm ready, too.
So am I.
Okay.
Now!
I got him! I got him!
Check your right ear, there should be a ribbon with a name.
Is that a tora?
Affirmative. We got a target identified.
Good.
Lost pet tora has been accomplished.
Can't we get back to our main task?
A great mission! A journey into the land of the waves!
Oh, my little tora is back!
Mommy was so worried!
Tora and the wife of the ruler of the land of the fire, Shijimi.
Ha-ha-ha! Stupid cat!
I don't understand why she ran away!
Now then.
For the next mission of the seventh group of Kakashi...
Huh?
Work in an old man's house,
go to the neighboring village, help with the harvest?
No!
No, thank you!
I want something more complicated and more interesting!
Not this kid's crap!
I agree.
He's whining all the time.
I knew it would be like that.
How dare you!
You're just a brand-new audience!
Like everyone else, you're the most selfish
and rebellious of all themselves!
Are you seeing this?
This is not a mission! You're just stupid!
Well, you've put a little bit out there.
Now, Ruto.
It seems you don't understand the importance of these missions.
Listen.
Every day,
we receive a huge number of different kinds of requests.
From babysitting to assassinations.
These requests are sorted
and each is assigned a rank,
A, B, C, or D,
depending on the difficulty class.
We have ninjas in my department,
high-qualified ninjas,
high-skilled ninjas,
high-skilled ninjas,
and low-skilled ninjas.
For each mission, the City Council appoints a suitable performer.
And if the mission is successful,
the recipient is sent to the village treasury.
Since you've recently become a high-skilled ninja,
you are assigned rank D missions.
So I had this tango soup yesterday.
It's tango soup.
It's supposed to be miso soup today.
Silence!
Oh, sorry.
Why do you always read me lectures?
I'm not a spoiled child anymore, like I used to be.
I'm a ninja now, and I want a corresponding relationship.
I don't want to listen to this anymore.
I don't want to listen to this anymore.
Naruto wants to do it, but he's not a high-skilled ninja.
And he wants the mission.
So be it.
Since you are so determined,
I'm going to give you a rank C mission.
You'll be bodyguards.
Really?
Hurray!
Are you a scientist or an important counselor?
Be patient, my friend.
I will introduce him to you.
Send our guest in.
What the hell?
It's just kids.
Especially kids with a stupid face.
Are you really a ninja?
Kids with a stupid face?
Who is this about?
I'll kill you!
We have to protect him.
I am Tadzun.
I am an archmage.
I am Tadzun.
I am an architect.
You will protect me on the way to my land where I build the bridge.
I hope that you will ensure my safety even at the cost of your own life.
Hurray!
All right!
What are you getting so excited about, Naruto?
This is the first time in my life that I'm going to be a traveler now.
Believe it!
Hey, am I supposed to travel like that?
He's with me and Jo-Nin.
So you don't need to worry about me.
He's with me and Jo-Nin.
He's with me and Jo-Nin.
How did he get me?
We need to clarify something.
Hey!
You're laughing at me!
I'm a great ninja!
One day I'm going to be a Hakage!
My name is Naruto Uzumaki!
Remember that name!
Remember it!
Hakage is powerful and wise.
And you're brainless.
You're never going to become one of them.
Shut up!
I'm going to do anything to become a Hakage!
One day I'm going to make my dream come true!
And you're going to have to show me respect, old man!
Even then I'm not going to respect you, little boy.
I'm going to rip you apart!
I'm going to rip you apart!
You have to protect our client, not fight with him.
Let go!
Say, Mr. Tatsuno.
What is it?
You're from the Land of Waves, right?
Yeah, I love it.
Kakashi Kansai, there are ninjas in that country too, aren't there?
No.
There are no ninjas in the Land of Waves.
But in other countries there are also ninjas.
Each with their own different customs and cultures.
Where ninja reside.
To the people of this country,
the existence of a hidden village is a means of strength
and a means of strength.
In other words,
that's how they protect this and maintain the balance of power
between the countries.
The ninja settlements are not under the control of the country.
They're independent of the country.
Now, a small island like the Land of Waves
doesn't need its own hidden villages.
They're protected by the sea anyway.
The five hidden villages that exist in the Land of Fire
are the Lands of Fire,
the land of wind,
lightning,
wind and earth.
They each occupy the largest and most powerful.
They form five great Shinobi nations together.
The Land of Fire has the hidden villages.
The Land of Water has the hidden villages.
The Land of Wind has the hidden villages.
The Land of Wind has the hidden villages.
The Land of Wind has the hidden villages.
The stage is set in stone.
Each hidden village of the five great Shinobi
is headed by Kage,
Hokage,
Mizukage,
Raikage,
Kazakage
and Tsutikage.
These are leaders of five gods known as
Gokage.
They are the ninja leaders in the world.
Then Lord Hokage is really important!
Is it really that strong? I don't believe it.
I got it with my first try. He can't be that great. Believe it.
You all doubt what I'm talking about, do you? That's what you were thinking.
No.
Well, you know, there are no ninja battles at Sea Rank, so you can relax.
And we're not going to meet any more ninjas or anything like that.
Not...
What?
Do it!
Sensei Kakashi!
Now it's your turn.
Ah!
I can't move.
Ah!
I've got to stop them! I can't stop them!
Hide behind me!
Ah! Ah!
Hi.
Sensei Kakashi! He's alive!
Show-off.
Huh? What?
Sensei Kakashi used a copying technique!
Naruto, I'm sorry I'm late.
I didn't mean for you to get hurt.
I just didn't think you'd be standing there with a pole.
They say I have a lot of luck.
Good job, Sasuke. Very smooth. You too, Sakura.
I was so scared. Sasuke wasn't scared at all.
It was his first time.
Didn't he feel scared at all?
He looked so calm. He looked so fresh on him.
It was so lame!
He had to come up and hit me.
Ugh! Why can't I keep up with that?
Hey.
Yeah?
You're not hurt, are you?
Scared kid.
Sasuke!
Naruto.
Stay still.
These ninjas have some poison in their claws.
You need to take care of the wound.
You have to only remove it from the blood.
So don't move around or the poison will spread faster.
By the way, Mr. Tatsuno.
Yeah?
What?
We need to talk.
They're tunins that's hidden in the mist.
Their specialty is relenting.
They're considered self-sacrificed warriors.
How did you know about the attack?
A puddle.
A clear rain.
When it hasn't rained in a long time.
The puddle seemed suspicious to me.
In that case, you knew in advance?
No, I didn't.
In that case, you knew in advance?
But why did you give them an attack?
I could have killed them right away.
But then I'd have learned.
I had to know who their target was.
And what they were after.
What are you getting at?
This.
I wanted to know if they were after us,
Ninja, or if they were after you, the bridge builder.
When you put in the request,
you asked for the standard recognition
for the robbers and the robbers.
You said there were at least a B rank mission.
If we didn't know this,
we would be ranked mission on our own.
Our task is to finish the destination.
If we knew that we would have to deal with Ninja,
we would have chosen other warriors for that.
Of course, you have your reasons,
but we do not accept the intentional deception.
We are now beyond the scope of this mission.
We are not yet ready for this.
We need to go back.
We should go back as soon as possible
and I really need to treat Naruto's wound
and get the bridge.
And I really need to treat Naruto's wound
and get the bridge as soon as possible.
Back in our village, we need to go to a doctor.
Naruto can take the mission.
I guess we should go back to the village.
Ouch!
Why does it always work that way?
Why can't I take it anymore?
Naruto, stop it! What are you doing?
I worked so hard to make my dream come true.
I trained alone for hours.
I don't want anything to get stronger.
I don't want anybody to see me.
I will never run away again
and let the world bounce where you may be.
I will never run away again
and I will not lose to Sasuke.
Upon this moon, I will finish this pledge
and then leave it.
Bridge builder, I'll complete this mission
and protect you with this kunai knife.
Don't worry, I'll be fine.
Naruto, it's really cool
how you took the poison out.
But if there's any more blood,
you're going to die.
Stop it, I'm serious.
Why didn't you say I could die earlier?
Let me see.
No, no!
Naruto, are you a masochist?
It's so stupid.
The wound, it's already starting to take shape.
Um, um...
Hm?
You have a very thick on your face.
Is everything going to be okay?
I'm scared.
Yeah, how are you feeling?
This healing, is it from the nine-tailed fox?
You failed the mission.
You said you were first-class mercenaries.
Why did I pay you so much?
Stop complaining.
I'll take care of this myself.
And this sword will be the last thing he sees.
You shouldn't have done that.
I hope it's true.
He hired a ninja for security.
Even the demonic brothers didn't beat them.
Now he's on guard.
We need someone with outstanding abilities.
Who do you think you're talking to?
I am the demon of the hidden fog,
the demon of the demon of the hidden fog, the demon of the hidden fog, the demon of the hidden fog, the demon of the hidden fog, the demon of the hidden fog.
The demon of the hidden fog, the demon of the hidden fog, the demon of the hidden fog, the demon of the hidden fog, the demon of the hidden fog, the demon of the hidden fog, the demon of the hidden fog, the demon of the hidden fog, the demon of the hidden fog, the demon of the hidden fog, the demon of the hidden fog, the demon of the hidden fog, the demon of the hidden fog, the demon of the hidden fog, the demon of the hidden fog, the demon of the hidden fog, the demon of the hidden fog, the demon of the hidden fog, the demon of the hidden fog, the demon of the hidden fog, the demon of the hidden fog, the demon of the hidden fog, the demon of the hidden fog, the demon of the hidden fog, the demon of the hidden fog, the demon of the hidden fog, the demon of the hidden fog, the demon of the hidden fog, the demon of the hidden fog, the demon of the hidden fog, the demon of the hidden fog, the demon of the
