        <pre>NARUTO
NARUTO
We cry for no one, we cry for no one
Our present is
Unleash the pain, unleash the heart, unleash the shadow
Take a deep breath and run through the darkness
Fighting and loving each other
The end is near
Unleash the pain!
Huh?
Today's the day to go!
Let's go!
Sasuke and Sakura, friends or enemies?
No...
Stop, Naruto!
What do you think it was?
Konohamaru.
That was a failed attempt.
That's why I was an excellent rival.
But I didn't do anything.
Then I call you up for a duel.
Sorry, but I have to go to the instruction.
Instruction?
That's right. Today's the day I'm going to be a ninja.
Sakura, isn't it time for you to go?
I know! I'm on my way!
How can you treat me like a kid? I'm an adult!
So, I'm not going to be a kid anymore.
I'm Sakura Haruna, a real ninja.
See you later!
Good morning, Sakura.
Good morning, Iro.
So the answer was you were a ninja.
What a surprise!
Those guys are crazy.
We're both ninjas now and we're both equal.
I won't be a ninja anymore.
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!
What are you doing here?
Only graduates are allowed in here.
Are you blind? Don't you see the headband?
I'm the one who should be asking you what you're doing here.
Let me put the headband on.
It looks like it was made for me.
Believe it.
No way Naruto is going to take off.
I'm glad.
I'm first!
I won again, Sakura.
Give it up!
I had to look back.
Sakura was at least a tenth of an inch ahead.
Have you all seen the headband?
Sakura...
She's looking at me.
I think she likes my headband.
Hey, whoa, where are you going?
Hi, Sakura.
Move it!
Good morning, Sasuke.
Mind if I sit with you?
Back off, forrest! I was next to Sasuke.
I was first, Sasuke.
I was the first to see him.
Everybody saw it.
Come on.
Actually, I was first before Sasuke.
No, I'm first.
I'll sit with Sasuke.
No, I'm!
Clueless.
The most prominent student of the year is Sasuke Uchiha.
Is that him?
Yes.
Is that him?
He's the one from the silent clan.
That's right.
Is that Naruto Uzumaki?
Naruto!
Back off, Sasuke!
Sakura...
What did they all find in him?
Sasuke, Sasuke!
What's so special about him?
Sasuke, show him!
Come on!
Whoa, that's great!
Sorry, did they find you?
What the...
What the...
Ah!
Stop!
You're pissing me off!
I was supposed to be the first to kiss Sasuke!
Naruto will pay for this!
You'd better run!
Run!
Run?
Danger!
Naruto?
You are so dead!
Hey, whoa!
Sakura, it was an accident!
You're pissing me off!
Hold on!
As usual.
Naruto in the epicenter of the hurricane.
As of today, you're ninjas.
You've been through a lot of trials and tribulations,
but that's not all.
You have far more difficult tasks to do.
While you're just juniors,
the first level,
you'll be divided into three.
Each group will have a mentor,
Junin, or a ninja.
Divide into three?
What?
Who do you think will be in Sasuke's group?
I don't know.
What a stupid question!
It's only me, of course!
Two more people?
They're only going to distract me.
I want to be Sakura!
And someone else, except Sasuke.
We want you to be in line with your capabilities,
so all the teams will be equal.
I will now announce the results of the division.
Squad 7.
Naruto Uzumaki.
Sakura Haruna.
Yay!
Thank you!
And Sasuke Utiha.
Ah!
Damn!
I wish I could be with Naruto.
Squad 8.
Hinata Hugo.
Yes, sir.
Kiba Inuzuka.
Shino Abrami.
How did you get in this room?
Get it!
True love wins!
I don't get it.
What do girls find in guys like that?
What's so special about them?
Don't you get it, Shikamaru?
Don't you get it?
No, I don't.
Because I'm not a girl.
You're so self-confident.
Jealousy is a bad thing.
I hate to be on your team.
Squad 10.
Ino Yamanaka.
Shikamaru Nara.
Did you say something funny?
Did your dream come true?
And...
Akimichi.
Ah!
Not food-boying!
Those are all the results.
Sensei Ruko.
Why does a talented guy like me have to be in the same group with Sasuke?
Sasuke has the best grades in the history.
And you have the worst grades.
To create that balance, you're best tuned to be in the same group.
Just make sure you don't rely on me, loser.
Hey, what did you say?
Hard of hearing.
Knock it off now or I'll tell you to sit down!
I'll introduce you to your Janine later.
Until then, class dismissed.
Sasuke, where were you?
Why did he go thing off so fast?
Since we're in the same group and all, I thought we could have a lunch together and get to know each other.
Hey, Sakura!
Since we're in the same group and all, I thought we could have a lunch together and get to know each other.
Why would I eat with you?
Nobody even crossed your mind.
But we're in the same group.
Why do you thought...
Naruto, you're annoying me so much.
Sasuke, where are you?
But, uh...
What a pain.
I get in the same group as Sakura, and he's in the same group.
There's got to be something to do with this.
Got it!
All right.
Since we're in the same group and all, I thought we could have a lunch together and get to know each other.
Yeah, that's the only way to work.
That's the only way to work.
That's the only way to work.
Why don't you look at me?
Why don't you look at me, you know?
Holy shit!
Naruto?
Naruto?
Get down!
Naruto, if you saw Sasuke, and he was right, I'd give you forever.
What the hell?
Nice trick.
Looks like he beat me in a row.
You're sweating.
What'd you think?
Now I'm against Naruto and my Sasuke in no kind.
Now I'm against Naruto and my Sasuke in no kind.
Now I'm against Naruto and my Sasuke in no kind.
Well, it's not that there's no rush or anything.
I'll get to know Sasuke for a while, at times.
Still...
How could he be thinking of me, with a face that's squarney and small, and a big forehead?
Why was I born with such a big forehead?
Sasuke! He's looking straight at me!
That one's darling!
Sakura, your forehead is so wide. It makes me want to kiss it.
Well, there's a lot to kiss there.
Well, that's just a fairy tale. There's nothing to be hopeful about.
Sakura, your forehead is so wide and charming.
It makes me feel like kissing it.
Ha!
Suri!
Suri!
It's a fairy tale! It's a fairy tale! It's for real!
Just kidding. That's the kind of nonsense only Naruto would say.
I want to ask you something.
Naruto, what do you think of him?
He knows about my feelings, but he doesn't pay attention to them.
He enjoys that theory of making me feel bad.
Naruto, he doesn't understand one single thing about me.
He's just annoying.
All I really want is for you to accept me. That's all.
You just want me to accept you?
Yes, I want to be your friend. I'd do anything for you.
I let my guard down.
I let my guard down.
I got you!
Shadow Clone Jutsu.
It's just desperate.
I finally know why I like Sakura so much.
I finally understand why I like Sakura so much.
My stomach!
What time is it?
Hey, what's going on?
I'll be right back.
It turns out he's so shy.
Maybe he needs some time.
Close. Very close.
I almost got over there.
But why did my stomach hurt when I barely kissed Sakura?
She thinks I'm annoying?
I said that three times.
I've been trying to get close to Sakura,
and she actually did that.
She thinks I'm annoying?
She thinks I'm annoying?
She'll hate him even more than me.
Saki, you're back.
Stop being so shy.
Are you ready now? You know, Minzy, you're here?
Because I am. I mean, I'm ready.
Hey, wait a minute.
Where's Naruto?
Oh, see, there you go.
Why do you keep asking him?
You know, I guess he's so annoying
because he wasn't raised well.
He doesn't have a mother or a father.
I wouldn't care if he didn't have a father or a mother.
Think about it. He doesn't care about everything
into his head.
If I was like Naruto, forget it.
I mean, my parents are mad at me.
I don't trouble them, so they always do what they want.
But if you don't have him,
then what's wrong, what's good?
He's selfish.
Daddy, he's all alone.
It's not about being isolated.
It's not about being harassed.
You have no idea what it means to be alone.
Why are you saying that?
Because you're annoying.
Oh, man!
I hope he doesn't get sick anymore.
I've got a little bit of sugar waiting for me.
Ahh!
Sasuke!
How did you lose?
I used the skill of release.
My favorite technique.
Why'd you have to turn yourself in me?
I used the skill of release.
I used the skill of release.
I used the skill of release.
Why'd you have to turn yourself in me?
I thought you'd go around like this on you,
so I did.
Ah, the same thing again.
This time you'll see what I'm really capable of.
You're going to be the winner.
Then you're going to find the best.
Get ready, Sasuke!
Ahh!
Hurry, Sasuke! It's time!
I need a bathroom!
I'm first! No, I'm first!
No, I'm first!
I'm not first!
Leave me first!
I'm not first!
I'm not first!
I'm an idiot!
I'm an idiot.
That's what I am.
Now I get it.
This is how Naruto feels.
I should treat him better.
Next time I see him, I'll be nice to him.
What did I eat?
Naruto.
Smile.
Smile.
Hey, Naruto!
Let's walk this class together.
Did she really say that?
She never smiled at me like that.
I think Sasuke
transformed into a sakura
and is trying to trick me.
Don't fool me, Sasuke!
You're going to get it!
Ahh!
Why is this happening again?
Naruto!
So this is where
Naruto lives.
Yes, he'll be in your team,
Sakura and Sasuke.
Good luck.
This milk is way back
from this expiration date.
One sip
and the stomach will be
hurting all day.
Seems like there's
a big problem
with these kids.
Naruto!
Naruto!

Why am I always
so lucky?
Why am I so lucky?

Nothing's gonna stop me now, please!
Next time on Panzer Fair!
Don't miss my big victory!
