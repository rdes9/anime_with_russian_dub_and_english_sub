Curse the seal!
I will crush this curse.
It's a strong barrier.
It will have the same power as you.
Your will is the source of power over it.
But if you don't endure and give up,
the curse will be pulled out of all fury.
Poor guy.
Too tired to even argue.
Man, how you grew up.
To say you are capable of crushing the seal of the cursed seal.
You...
Orochimaru.
Long time no see, Kakashi.
Kakashi against Orochimaru face to face.
No offence, Kakashi, but I didn't come to you.
I'm interested in the boy behind your back.
What do you want from Sasuke?
You've acquired something new.
How I envy your luck.
I don't believe that last time I saw you.
Did you?
This gift.
The serengan in your left eye.
It's only fair that I want to have it too.
The power of the Uchiha clan.
All right, fool, you had it now.
He's...
There's no way.
Hey!
What?
What the?
He's got...
He's got a lot of bugs.
Like a moth.
This guy's a freak.
Great.
But don't hope you'll scare me.
They're a rare species of parasites that attack the hordes,
eating the chakra of their victims.
An army of this size will empty you in less than a minute.
My advice.
Give up before it's too late.
You can't fight on two fronts.
If you use your power against me,
my friends will attack from behind.
And vice versa.
If you use your power against them,
you'll open up for my blow.
Either way, you're over.
And that's terrible.
It's one of the things that's in the world.
Hey, you!
Come back here!
Where do you think you're going?
You think we won't catch up?
You gotta drive him to the dead end before he gets away.
Dead end!
There.
You didn't miss a single little punch.
That'll teach you next dark time.
You have a good idea, man.
I saw something in you.
Oh, look at your eyes.
If you leave this place with me,
I will make you stronger.
Follow me.
Come with me and I will make you stronger.
I will make you stronger.
Be my weapon.
Fight me.
And you will become stronger.
Man, don't disappoint me.
That's the end.
Never.
You seem to be very proud of your own experience.
I take it.
No!
What are you doing?
That's the end.
That's the end.
Never.
You seem to be very proud of your own experience.
That's the end.
That's never gonna be the end.
Now you've...
Now you've been attacked!
Like you said yourself,
you need to hold a dagger in your hand.
Right?
Like you said yourself,
you need to hold a dagger in your hand.
Right?
What?
Right!
What the?
I thought the right hand worked.
So it was just a trick
to make us believe that he's got one big hand.
Clever.
What's new?
This village is hidden in the sounds
that everyone's talking about.
It's mine, you see, it's mine.
I think you've created it.
I think you understand everything
without any extra words.
You have your wild ambitions.
Oh, yes.
As always.
But to play this game,
I need the figures on the board.
They will fulfill my will.
I will crush you!
And Sasuke is one of your pawns?
No, he's not a pawn.
He's a far more valuable figure.
But as for the others,
you know how it is in chess.
You have to...
sacrifice.
My hands!
What's wrong with them?
What?
I really gave you advice.
I gave you advice.
I also sent my little friends
to dig a hole in your hands.
Both of them, just to be sure.
One hole is good,
and two is even better.
Isn't that right?
Staph 2
Staph 2
Stop.
Don't come any closer.
I don't mind you being
the one of the Three Legendary Ninja.
One more step towards Sasuke, and one of us will die!
Funny!
Oh, Kakashi, all you're doing is all in vain.
What?
Do you really believe that the barrier will help?
Do you think you can keep him from wanting?
You know I'm right.
A heart wants only one thing.
No matter what barriers you put in his path,
he wants revenge, doesn't he?
And you think you can take advantage of that?
Not Sasuke.
You cannot stop him.
At some point he will come to me
in search of power.
Unless, of course, you take the opportunity to kill me.
Now is your chance.
Take it if you dare.
One of us will die.
I must have been crazy.
I'd say this one has had it.
The winner is Shino Aburami.
Wait! How did he do that?
Who is he? Find out!
Pyakugan!
I had no idea.
I thought he was using some kind of technique.
But he's not just controlling insects.
They live inside of him.
Living inside of him?
There's a legend.
I heard a legend about the masters of bugs.
Yes, I heard about that clan too.
They start from home mattress porn.
They enter into a secret deal with them.
They allow the bugs to live inside of them,
and they get their will in return.
Insects are their first call.
They fight for them and destroy their enemies.
But they also say that the members of the clan
have to feed the bugs with their own chakra.
So this guy is one of them.
One of the masters of bugs.
Well, that didn't happen to him.
What happened? Why does he have such hands?
At some point in the fight,
this Shino made the bugs
buy a hole in Zak's hands.
As soon as Zak decided to use the spreading wave,
he was doomed.
Without finding a way out,
he was locked inside and exploded.
Sooner or later, someone had to leave.
This time it was Zak.
We had nothing to do with him,
except the team and the task.
Still, I'll take revenge for you, Zak.
It's getting chilly in here.
Man, that Shino is really cool.
But it's not forever.
We'll see what happens if I fight him.
I thought Shino was weird, but now...
Oh, wow! Congratulations, Shino!
Way to go! Great job!
I hope you'll do the same.
Yeah! Died in the name of the leader!
Uh, light it on.
Moving on to the third match.
Kakashi-sensei!
Hi.
What do you mean, hi?
That's all you can say?
What about Sasuke? How is he?
Oh, he's fine.
Sleeping soundly in the labyrinth.
But he's been blocked by a number of envelopes.
Tsurugi Misumi versus Kankuro.
Finally. My turn.
Careful, Kankuro.
You underestimate the enemy.
Idiot.
It's him!
I don't look like a hero.
I always look like a chick.
Not even with a baby.
A little piece of advice.
Once I go into action, just give up.
And quickly.
If you give up, I promise it'll be quick and painless.
That was a bad one.
Funny. I was going to say the same thing.
I was going to say the same thing.
I was going to say the same thing.
I was going to say the same thing.
Though I can't promise it'll be painless.
All right.
If you're ready, let the third battle begin.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
