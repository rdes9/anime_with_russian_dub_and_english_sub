Gently, open your eyes, and get closer
I'm sure it will reach you, I'm sure it will reach you, more
Ah
I'm sure it will reach you, I'm sure it will reach you
But it's not like I'm going to run away from you
For ever I will stay far away
I'm sure it will reach you, I'm sure it will reach you
But if it's not a dream, it's meaningless
Far away
Far away
If you want the power of the sky, let your mind soar
If you lack the power of the sky, let your mind soar
When heaven and earth come together, they will lead you forever
This secret is the secret that guides us from this place today
This what? Or is that a secret?
Anyway, it's about the scrolls
I think it's a good time to open and read the heaven and earth scrolls now
Okay, here goes nothing
Okay, here goes nothing
What? What does this mean?
A man? A person?
Oh no, this is a summoning of a spirit protector
Naruto! Sakura! Hurry and get rid of the scrolls!
What? It's you?
Hey
Long time no see
So, second mission accomplished! Nine recruits together again!
Eruka sensei?
Looks like you've had a rough time in this test
Hey, what's with the surprises? Why are you all here with the summoning?
At the end of the second mission, we are supposed to welcome the past recruits
Then well, it's just good luck that I've got an important task for you to do
The messenger for you guys
The messenger?
Hoo, and you made it just in time too
And now
Congrats, you passed the second mission
To celebrate your success, I would like to give you all this hot cup of noodles, but...
Noodles? Really? That's so cool!
Wait, I'm not done
So cool!
Hey, not yet, Naruto
Oh yeah, noodles, that would be awesome!
That would be awesome, especially after all the crap that we had to eat in two days
Awesome! I'm gonna eat everything they give me
Is he getting old?
Yeah!
Shut up!
All right, well, I can see you're still as noisy for activism, Naruto
Now I see
So then if we had to discover the math exam
What would you have done with us, Sensei Ruko?
As usual, Sasuke, you should have been thinking
You figured out the secret
Part of this exam was to test how well you see if a commission all the way through
Simply put, you knew that the rules were the rules of your mission
You tried to open one
What? What? What happened?
If a school was opened before time ever opened it
Some would have found out the hard way
It's a good thing you two didn't try to do it, isn't it?
I owe you, Sensei Kabuto!
Yeah, that's good!
Oh, yes, Sensei
Yeah?
What is that writing on the wall?
The parts with the letters are written on
Trying to explain it, it's not simple to me, but we can't understand it
Oh, please! Look, that's the mission!
That's not the matter now!
Well, actually, explaining that is another one of the duties that I'm concerned with this year, Carol
What? Serious?
That's right, it's serious business
Give it a good read
This is what Lord Hakage recorded as the principle that you need to follow
The principle?
Heaven stands for your mind and wish for your body
The qualities of that are your desire
If you wish to take your mind higher, get it?
Mm-mm
All right, I'll explain it
In other words, if you're not as wise as your intellect, Naruto
Then you have to make something twice as strong to learn all the information and skills
that you need to prepare for your missions
Okay, I get it
And you, if Earth's qualities are not enough,
shape your body into a tank
So if you wish to utilize your physical strength, Sakura,
then you have to ensure that you work on your physical condition every single day
so it improves all the time
When heaven and earth come together,
the parallelism will lead you forever
Meaning, when mind and body are working together,
even the most dangerous missions can become an easy one
So what if it has a missing letter?
Well, that part is not at all beautiful, Annen
Do you see that symbol on the scroll?
It's the character for person, it refers to you two
You see, these five days of the survival test,
you've proved that you have the skills to become a tuning
You guys really did an amazing job
Tuning is a leader, a guide
It's a tutor responsible to be aware of the strengths and weaknesses
of those serving under him
And, to know skills and training on what you need to do
is to succeed on a mission
You did an excellent job on this mission
You see, you were on the recent sections of your lesson
Well, that's it
That was everything I was supposed to say to you
Got it!
Huh?
Hmm
One more thing
For the third exam, don't push it too hard
Especially you, Naruto
Ruka Sensei!
Since I got this cap, I'm not your student anymore
So you don't need to worry about me at all
Not anymore!
This is a test for you
You don't need to worry about me at all
Not anymore!
I mean, it's a proof that I'm a real sponge ninja, right?
Maybe I'm noisy, but I'm not a kid
And I'll pass the test, you'll see
Fact!
Right now
I'm a ninja too
Naruto, you're right
I'm sorry about that
Look, I know this trio is the best
I want to be the one who breaks the news to them
Fine, if you're held up on it
I'll just leave that team in your hands
But I would have found a little confidence in them, you know?
Thank you
Thank you very much
Wait, those guys are Kakashi's students, aren't they?
Listen, if Kakashi's going to break them
Yeah, I wouldn't trust them now just yet, Ruka
Ruka needs his students
He needs them all
They're not his students anymore
They're mine
And that's the simple truth
It seems to me, Kakashi
You're the one who truly understands
the weak and strong sides of this young jibata
It might very well be you, Kakashi
How is it?
Does the curse marks still cause your pain?
No, not really
Thanks to you, it's much better
Thank you
That's good, let's get back to business
So, Orochimaru is one of the three legendary ninjas, isn't he?
I mean, he goes to be
So, in fact, even the special forces
I believe in the black ops unit could bring him down
I'd heard that he was already dead
I guess that wasn't true
Why did he come here now anyway?
He's a very promising guy
There's a magic blood of the Uchiha clan in his veins
That kid
He's after Sasuke, isn't he?
What?
Anko, 21 participants have passed the second test
And as per the rules, before the third test
The first one to pass the test is Seif
The first one in five years
Now, for the time being, we'll just continue the test of the tunins as we planned
But I also want to follow you as well
Yes
First of all, I'd like to congratulate you on passing the second test
There were 78 in the first test, and now there are 21
I promised to reduce their number by half
But I really wanted to reduce them to the same number
I'm really hungry
I didn't think there'd be so many left
This is such a pain
Sasuke and his team are here too
Well of course they did
We've helped them so much
If only they'd keep them safe
They'd never pass
I see your team was pretty good, Kakashi
They must have been really lucky
Of course, they were doomed to failure
They were doomed to failure
After all, that level requires all the strength and abilities
We've got to get far out of that
Well now I guess it's part of growing up
Disappointment is part of growing up, isn't it, Kakashi?
Did you say so?
All right, Kakashi, while you're at it
Your carelessness pisses me off
There's no way I'm going to let you beat me
So that's what Sensei will try to do
Well, judging by their looks, no doubt Master Guy says he's going to lose
Guy Sensei is the coolest teacher I've ever seen
He's the coolest teacher in school
He just goes with cool
You watch this, Sensei Guy
Someday I'll make you proud
I do not want those who I love to cry again
That is why I am never going to lose again, Sensei Guy
Never
As expected, all the best here
I am not going to lose again, Sensei Guy
Never
As expected, all the best here
Sasuke Uchiha
I'll get you back for what you did to Sasuke
No matter what you did to him
I can't believe only seven teams from 26 left
Sure enough, it's only Gara
Akumaru's a little strange
Those sound like ninjas
Not a dime a cent
Thank goodness
Hey, look
All of the leaflets are made of tin
Oh, everybody's here
Not only them, there's Old Hokage
Master Iruko
And even fat-nose
Almost everybody I know
I don't know anything about this
It's hard to imagine there's going to be so much left to contest
And so many of them are recruits
So that's why they've forced the students
All right, now, Sensei
Lord Hokage is going to explain the third exam to you
And better listen carefully next
Lord Hokage, they're all yours
First, before I tell you what the third is maintaining
I would like to explain something very important to you
Listen, you have to understand
I'm going to reveal to you the purpose of the exams
The purpose?
Why do you suppose the country and the allies have come together to organize the exams?
They say it's just to contribute to friendship between nations, to be sure
But it's important that the true nature of these exams
Be sure to speak
There are representations of the power between our nations
And what's that supposed to mean?
Now, you know the history
All the countries that were early out
The ones that were in the nations
Did actually fought with each other for power
But in order to stop the senseless destruction
Those greatest warriors began to compete on neutral territory
That's how the battle known as the Tsunin exam came about
Well, then why do we have to go through these exams?
It's not like we're painting this to pictures to go fight
Well, actually, there is no point in arguing
The exams were made to select those who would become the Tsunin
That's just not the whole story
This is an opportunity for the ninjas to glorify their nation on their backs
And to join the other ninjas in a deadly battle
To glorify the nation?
The most powerful people in every country are invited to the third Tsunin exam
They also personally look for warriors
This exam will determine your destiny as a ninja
But more importantly, the owners watch your battle
And they look to see how strong each ninja and each country is
If a gap in power prevails in one village
Their people get a lion's share of orders
And on the other hand, weak villages are expected to decline
Therefore, the stronger our nation is
The better our conditions are in negotiations with neighboring countries
So it's important to show the military power of the village
Okay, but even so, why is it necessary for us to risk our lives?
The country's strength is the village's strength
The village's strength is the ninja's strength
And the true ninja's strength is shown only in a deadly battle
This exam is a chance for each people to show their ninjas and the strength of their country
It's because this is a time where your life is in line
And this is a very reason that for the several generations of ninjas who fought for their own people
It's truly a dream of theirs
But then again, did you mention friendship before?
You should have listened more attentively
You also have the wrong idea of challenges
This is a tradition that keeps the balance of strength in the struggle for death
In the ninja world, this is the strength
The third exam is a deadly battle for the glory of the village and for your dream
Well, he sure convinced me
I'm ready for anything
Just tell me what to do, I'll handle anything you throw at me
Very well
Now listen to me, I'm going to show you the essence of the third exam
Lord Hohage, before you do, let me tell you something
Huh?
Lord Hohage, before you do, please allow me, Hayate Gekku, the judge of the third exam, to say my word
So be it
It's nice to meet you all
There's something I would like all of you to do before the exam
Well, that was last time
So this is goodbye
Because there is everyone in me
I want to cry, I want to run away
I want to forget happiness
Light was born, darkness was born
Two are one, harmony and telepathy
Hey, can you hear me?
I'll tell the teachers about the seal, I'm tired of it
In the next episode, the reduction, only half will remain
I'm scared of what will happen to us
