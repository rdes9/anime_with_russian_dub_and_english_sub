And now, I pray this is shit and the next part of the test.
Yeah, I knew it was gonna work! Yeah! Yeah! Hoorah!
He's an interesting guy.
Incredible. He's got the nerve to give a completely blank test paper.
Naruto Uzumaki.
Yeah, he's a funny guy.
The Chunin Exams stage two, The Forest of Death.
This whole place is completely losing me out.
It sure is called the Forest of Death, and soon enough you'll find out why.
It sure is called the Forest of Death, and soon enough you'll find out why.
This whole place is called the Forest of Death, and soon enough you'll find out why.
Do your best, don't scare me.
I can do this.
So, looks like we've got ourselves a tough guy.
Bye.
You tough enough to handle this?
You're not afraid, are you?
Tough guys like you, you're treating them like all over this forest.
I was just returning your knife.
I didn't ask for that, ninja.
You know, I really wouldn't like it if anything was close behind me.
If you wish to reach me, play with your hand.
My pardon.
With a scythe of your bloody knife, you incited me to cut my hair.
I probably didn't just play him a little silly.
You meant you no harm.
Not at all.
Like what?
I thought this forest was scary, but they're a lot scarier.
Hey, I wonder if I can do that with my tongue.
Seems like everyone's got a gun today.
There must be something in the air.
This is gonna be fun.
Quick, tell me!
What have I done to throw a knife at me?
Now before we begin this test, I have something to hand out to you all.
It's just a standard consent form.
Before the test, all of you are going to have to read over this form and then sign it.
What form?
Some of you may not come back to this test, and I have to get your consent to that request.
Otherwise, it'll be my responsibility.
Now, I'll explain what you'll be doing on this test.
Here, pass this out.
The first thing you need to know is that this test will test every one of your surviving skills.
Survival?
That's bad.
First, I'll give you all the description of the terrain on the practice field.
The 44th battle training zone has 44 locked entrances.
There are rivers and a forest inside.
In the center is a locked tower located 10 kilometers from the gate.
This site is where your survival test will take place.
It's in this confined area that will undergo the survival test.
The test consists of...
...and everything goes battle to get your hands on these scrolls.
Both of them?
Yes.
You'll be fighting to get both a heaven scroll and an earth scroll.
Altogether, 26 teams will be taking part in this test.
One half of those teams will be going after that scroll,
and the other half will be trying to get the earth scroll.
I'll hand over 100 scrolls to each team, and that's what you'll be vying for.
Okay.
So how do I finish this test?
Your entire squad must bring both a heaven and earth scroll to the tower.
That means a very bad half of us will fail the test.
And more if by every team they will get both the scrolls,
no one ever said it would be easy.
Oh, and one more thing.
The test doesn't have time on it.
You must finish it within five days.
Five days?!
What are we supposed to do for five days?!
Just look around.
Look, there's just a lot of things to eat.
There's plenty to feed all of you.
Yeah, but in the forest that's not just plenty of food.
There's plenty of animals and poisonous plants in there.
Oh, man!
Quiet down!
This is what they call their health for right now.
That means all 13 teams will pass the test.
With the days long and the nights short,
we'll have less time for sleep and recovery.
And less time to go home.
It is exactly what we need.
Completely surrounded by enemies,
there won't be time to rest or have to keep a constant watch.
Right.
This test also measures endurance in every line.
This is designed to be a cooling test.
And I'm sure not everyone will be able to challenge.
So, if anything, can we quit?
Of course not.
In the middle of a battle, can't they start it quick?
Well, if you go to trouble, they can kill you.
Oh, just great.
This is such a drag.
There are also some major measures qualified.
The first is number one.
All members of the team can't make it to the tower
with both hands ever tied.
Number two, if the team is unable
or if a match has been incapacitated and cannot continue.
But number four, none of you have to read the contents
of the scrolls until you have reached the tower.
What happens if you accidentally read it?
Let me put it this way, young man.
You don't want to know.
There are times when you need to be able to share secret documents,
so the scroll rule is another test for integrity.
Okay, I've done it.
Each team takes turns in exchange for their own scrolls.
After that, each team pick a gate and let inside.
Oh, and I have one more little advice.
Just don't die.
I see how it is.
We won't know which team has which scroll
and we won't know which of the team is carrying the scroll.
Stealing information is very important in this game.
It's just like Ibiki said.
Everyone is going to be determined to pass
and all of them are my enemies.
Hmm, it looks like this guy understands
how much we're involved in this test.
Well, well, well.
If it isn't the little future failure.
What's up, billboard crowd?
I thought you would have been washed out of the door
right by now.
Your big floor alone should have gotten you tossed.
So sad.
You're jealous I'm failing five days a week, okay?
You're clearly trying to make someone very ugly.
And you are very ugly.
Ugly, if you're ugly, ugly, ugly, ugly, ugly, ugly, ugly, ugly, ugly.
Enough, you better give up.
Sakura, you know you're going to fail this test.
Okay, you're the one who's going to fail.
I wouldn't want to be between them.
Why don't they hate each other?
Who cares? I don't care what their relationship is.
Huh?
What are you doing over there?
Oh, nothing. I... I'm just... nothing.
That's Hinata.
That's Hinata. Weirdo.
I... I...
Oh, you're cut!
Here, take this.
Miss!
Well, hey, we'll see you later.
I guess I'll use it for later, then.
All right, everybody, we're gonna start a sandwich.
I wonder if anyone's gonna survive this.
Ha! We are so little!
Listen up, all the teams have seen their swirls.
So everybody, go to your gates and wait there.
When the gates open, the test is on!
YAHOO!
We will survive and we will win, I'm sure of it!
Hinata, you've got to be strong for this!
Yeah...
The test could cost us our lives, what a deal.
But since we're gonna have to pass it, we're gonna have to find Naruto first.
I've got some stuff here. Chips?
Okay, strawberry candy?
I've got some stuff here. Chips?
I've got some stuff here. Chips?
I've got some stuff here. Chips?
Okay, strawberry candy?
Believe it! You're gonna bring it on, Ninja!
You're gonna know what you like!
Yeah! That's it!
The time has come to get the work done.
I'm not only afraid of other teams,
I'm afraid of guys that you like better than you know me.
We'll take the guys and get easy prey.
We'll get this group on them and announce them.
Anything goes around.
Guys, this ain't my way to go!
Just watch! Soon everyone will know the name of the winner!
Rock Lee!
Rock Lee!
All right, let's go!
The second part of the test has begun!
You know who I'm gonna be calling.
Yeah, it's the three suckers.
Well, let's go! Here we go!
Okay, first thing you have to do is find somebody.
Are you ready, Spinata?
Yeah.
Yakagal!
Take it easy. The test has just begun.
That means...
What's that mean?
Whoever our enemies are,
I want to find them before they find us.
You're an impatient fool.
We have only one goal.
Don't you forget that.
What are you doing, Georgie?
I'm trying to find my enemies.
I'm trying to find my enemies.
What are you doing, Georgie?
Just having a snack.
I mean, I have to be very strong, don't I?
We haven't even been out here in five minutes.
Yeah.
We have a job to do here.
I can't.
I got to eat.
They're my favorite food.
You and your snacks.
This is my test, you know.
You better not have more than I.
I say, no.
You guys, put your hands up.
Oh, no.
Oh, man.
I got to win five more tests.
So, we know that all the teams are heading to the tower, right?
I say, let's lay a trap
and steal the scrolls from whoever we catch.
Well, well.
We've got guests.
Bunch of fools.
They don't even know how easy it was to find them.
Well, it seems they've figured out that we're close.
But they're not.
Hey, what's wrong?
What's in your shirt?
Oh, what is that thing?
Oh, God.
No.
No.
Wow, it looks like the leeches have found them.
They sense the heat of the body and the smell of the sweat
and then they attack the victim with a whole pack of them.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
These predators are stupid.
We take into account how to trap our enemies.
Get out of here.
There's one team down.
Sounds like the fun has begun.
Did you hear that?
Someone's screaming.
I do not like this place.
Okay, fine.
I'm not scared of it.
It's going to be a good kick.
Excuse me for a minute.
I really got a yawn.
Yeah, right.
Get out of here.
What is this?
No.
Not in front of my eyes.
Move out of the way.
Yeah.
Yeah, that was a lot.
You're such a pig.
You're really disgusting.
Sasuke, he's a bum, but you don't think it's too much.
Yeah, what the hell did you find?
Better watch out for him, Sakura.
I think he's gone crazy.
Yeah, you're right.
I just went for it.
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
I just went for it.
Sasuke, no!
All right, that's fine.
Sasuke, what are you doing?
Take a good look at him.
Talk.
What have you done to Naruto?
What?
What do you mean?
I am Naruto!
What about the cut on your cheek?
I guess you didn't know that the real Naruto was injured before the test.
You only put the knife on the left leg, not the right one.
But the real Naruto is right-handed.
You're transforming even worse than Naruto.
Tell me who you are.
All right, you got me.
So what?
I'm going to take your witness anyway, no matter what kind of hand.
So, which one do you have?
Fine then.
I guess I'll just have to take you back.

Wait a minute, honest man!
You haven't paid any attention today!
You know what you're gonna do?
You will definitely lose!
No!
This bastard's gonna pay for everything!
What? Why? I don't like it at all!
