Ninja Academy
Hey, Tam!
Tell me!
I don't have to answer.
What?
So cute!
Are these the kids under the care of Kakashi Egai?
Well, first of all, you need to make a statement.
No.
It seems that this year the students are looking forward to exams.
And we examinators too.
Well, Sasuke-kun, Naruto, let's go!
Don't pull.
Sasuke?
Here is the quiet Sasuke.
He doesn't give you peace?
Lee, let's go.
What are you doing there?
You go ahead, I need to check something here.
Go.
What is it with him?
How do I know?
Hey, you with the evil eyes!
Wait a minute!
What do you want?
How about a fight right now?
120 percent!
A challenge in the rock style right now!
Are you talking about a fight here and now?
Yes!
My name is Rock Cliff.
Before you ask for someone else's name, you need to say your own name, like you said.
Uchiha Sasuke-kun.
What is it?
I don't know.
What is it?
I don't know.
Uchiha Sasuke-kun.
So you already know?
I want to fight you.
I want to check how effective my technique will be.
Against the descendants of a family that everyone calls up as brilliant ninjas.
Besides...
Sakura-san, I love you!
Not this!
I hate these stupid eyelashes!
And I hate your hairstyle!
And they roll from the eyebrows, they are too thick and thick!
And you yourself are some kind of disgusting!
You're just an angel!
No!
I didn't expect anything else.
But if so...
Yes, he's really dangerous!
Hey, you! Don't throw your disgusting things!
Can't you see that I barely managed to get away from them?
You don't have to hate me like that!
Again! Again they call Sasuke, not me!
Damn it!
How can you be easily provoked just by knowing their name?
Uchiha Sasuke-kun.
Uchiha Sasuke-kun.
Uchiha Sasuke-kun.
Uchiha Sasuke-kun.
Uchiha Sasuke.
And if you know Uchiha Sasuke-kun's name, you have a very uneducated team, Sasuke.
Do you even realize how much influence this name has on your eyebrows?
What do you think?
Clunel.
Nice! I can fight with the number one rookie right now!
And then I'll prove it to you, Gai-sensei!
Wait!
Leave that fat-nosed guy to me!
Hey, Sasuke!
What?
If we have at least five minutes, I'll have time to deal with him!
I don't want to fight with you, Uchiha-sensei.
Uchiha-sensei!
And that's the same thing!
Sasuke, Sasuke, shut up!
You're tired of it already! Sasuke, Sasuke!
Oh, you!
Konohara-pu!
This guy is strong, after all.
Let's make a conclusion.
You're not good enough for me, rivals.
Why?
Because I'm Sasuke.
Why?
Because I'm the strongest genius of the village, Lestir.
He's my leg strike.
What kind of chakra does he have in his hand?
Interesting.
I agree to fight.
Stop it, Sasuke.
We need to make it in time to three.
We don't have 30 minutes left.
Don't worry about it.
I'll do it in five minutes.
Here he is!
I'm sorry, Gai-sensei.
Maybe I'll have to break the ban.
Maybe I'll have to use that technique.
Flute whistle!
Up!
Evasion!
Block!
What?
Sasuke!
How could it be?
His block was supposed to pass now.
He slipped through my defense.
What is it?
Ninjutsu?
Or magic?
After all, it rises.
Well, if that's the case, it's a great chance to get used to such tricks.
Well, let's get down to business.
It can't be!
It's Shingan!
Sasuke-kun learned so quickly!
His eyes!
And they shine there!
So that's what Shingan is!
After all, Sasuke-kun is so cool!
If this is the same Shingan as the inherited Kakashi-sensei, then he will be able to solve the technique of this fat guy!
Ninjutsu or Ninjutsu, whatever it is, it's some kind of magic, and I'll find out right now!
Sasuke-kun becomes stronger and stronger in the eyes!
You can see the clan quietly at once!
Well, of course, Sasuke-kun shouldn't play like him!
What?
What about Shingan?
Even Shingan failed to solve it!
It can't be!
What kind of technique does he have?
That's right!
My technique does not relate to Ninjutsu or Ginjutsu!
Sasuke!
That's right!
My technique is just Taizutsu!
Sasuke!
It's so sudden that it's probably hard for you to believe, but ...
They say that Shingans can see all the techniques of Ginjutsu, Taizutsu and Ninjutsu!
Yes, probably!
Undoubtedly!
You can guess the techniques of Ginjutsu and Ginjutsu, which are required to perform the spinning of the chakra or tying the symbols!
However, it is not so easy to guess only the techniques of Taizutsu!
What does it mean?
Even if you noticed my movements with your eyes, your body is not prepared at such a speed as to react quickly to my techniques of Taizutsu!
In other words, even though you saw it with your own eyes, your body does not have time to react, and you can't do anything about it!
You know, strong guys are divided into two types.
The first one is talented, and the second one is strong!
If your Shingan is a talent, inherited from the Uchiha family, then I just carefully completed my martial art!
In general, your Shingan and my excellent technique of Taizutsu are absolutely incompatible!
Block!
Kagebuya!
So, I will prove this technique!
Strong guys are superior to talented guys!
What is he going to do?
My technique!
Kagebuya!
So, I will prove this technique!
Strong guys are superior to talented guys!
What is he going to do?
My technique!
Kagebuya!
Li, stop it now!
What is it? What happened?
Sasuke-kun!
Sasuke-kun!
Sasuke is defeated! What happened while I was unconscious?
Are you okay, Sasuke-kun?
It's so hard for him!
Sasuke couldn't even defend himself!
Did you want to watch us?
Li, this technique is forbidden!
What kind of turtle is this?
Excuse me, he is too strong!
It seems that he is being scolded for something!
Maybe this is the sensei of this fat guy?
This is the sensei of this fat guy?
Of course, I wasn't going to use any tricks!
I have no doubt that this is his sensei!
What do you want?
That's the turtle over there, right?
Of course! Don't you see it?
Can turtles become a sensei, ninja?
I don't know!
Are you out of your mind?
Are you going to continue to justify yourself?
You should know very well what it means to put your personal technique on display for a shinobi!
I suffered from such a fool!
What? Have you made up your mind?
Well, then, Gai-sensei, please!
Well, well, you are still very young!
You! You!
One more cut!
Even fatter!
Li, do you agree with me?
Super-fat! Super-cut!
Cool! Super eyebrows!
For the first time in my life I see such a thing!
Hey! Hey, you! Don't you dare to mock Gai-sensei!
Shut up!
You are constantly behaving like an idiot!
Now get a reaction!
What did you say?
Hey, Li, come on!
Idiot!
Li, come on!
Come on!
Sensei!
Li!
Sensei!
I... I...
Enough, Li!
Don't say anything!
Sensei!
Li!
And this is what I lost?
Yes! This is what I call youth!
Sensei!
They look good!
Idiot!
Idiot!
You better shut up!
It's too dangerous to say that!
Come on, Li!
Youth is a property to be mistaken!
Don't be upset!
You are too kind to me!
Sensei!
Come on! Run to the stadium!
And a hundred circles face the sunset!
I got you, Sensei!
Well, let's go!
Hey, you, wait!
We haven't finished the conversation yet!
Have you forgotten about the exam for the students?
There is not much time left!
Exactly!
Li!
I hope you took the lesson from today's fight!
In the same way, you will be punished if you are going to break the ban on the upcoming exams!
Clear?
Youth!
Youth!
Five hundred circles around the stadium!
Stupid!
See?
By the way, what kind of turtle is this?
And these kids are by chance not from the Kakashi detachment?
No!
Look here!
Hey, guys!
How is Kakashi Sensei doing?
Do you know Kakashi?
Not only do I know!
People call us eternal rivals with him!
Damn it!
What are you talking about?
In fact, Gai Sensei!
It's always better to talk in real life than to talk in real life!
Kakashi!
Therefore, our score with him at the moment is fifty against forty-nine!
Wow!
So fast!
And I have to tell you that I am stronger than Kakashi!
He is really fast!
His speed is really higher than Kakashi!
Is he a human or what?
Well, isn't Gai Sensei cool to you?
Damn it!
I'm sorry that Li has caused you so much trouble!
Thanks to me, you were saved!
He says that he is cooler than Kakashi!
Damn it!
It seems to me that he is not bluffing!
And Li and you should go to the auditorium!
Well, wait for me!
Well, good luck to you, Li!
Goodbye!
Sasuke!
Finally, I want to say something else!
In fact, I decided to come here to find out what I am capable of!
And just now I told you that I am capable of everything!
Unfortunately, the strongest genius in the village of Konoha is one of the members of my team, not me!
And I will go out to fight in order to kill him!
Besides him, you are also one of my targets!
Get ready for the exam!
I'm ready!
I'm ready!
I'm ready!
Get ready for the exam!
Sasuke-kun!
Well, it turns out that Tikhon's clan is not so cool!
Naruto!
Damn it! Shut up!
Next time I'll kill him!
Despite the fact that I blew him dry, right?
What are you talking about?
Did you see his hand?
This broad probably trained very well!
Every day!
Every day!
Even more than you!
Only this says a lot!
I think so!
Sasuke-kun!
How interesting!
It's getting more and more interesting!
The Tsunin exam is ahead!
Well, let's go?
Naruto!
Sakura!
Yeah!
To be continued...
To be continued...
To be continued...
Don't cry, cause you're so right
Don't try with fake so fierce
Cause you will hate yourself in the end
Don't try to look so wise
Don't cry, cause you're so right
Don't try...
Are you kidding me?
Are they coming after all?
I'm burning, I'm burning, I'm burning
Why am I the only one?
Open your eyes and look at me!
Next episode!
All the rivals of Fookeen 9 will be gathered!
I'm going to win again!
