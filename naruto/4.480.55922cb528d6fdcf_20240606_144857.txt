NARUTO
I'm crying for no one, I'm crying for no one
Our present is
Untie the pain, untie the heart, untie the shadow
Breathe in, run through the darkness
Fighting and loving each other
The end is yet to come
The end is yet to come
He's late!
Naru-ta, just sit down!
I don't want to! How come our teachers are the only ones who work?
I'm ready to work!
The other groups have already started their training with their teachers!
And Iruka said he's going home too!
Okay...
Hey, what are you doing?
Naru-ta!
That's what he gets for coming late!
Surprise!
You're asking for trouble! You know you should do that!
At least you got something like this!
You think our teacher Ninja is going to fall for that?
Yeah, Sasuke's right! You're so close, Naruto!
It worked! It fell right on his head!
I'm sorry, Sensei! I told him not to do it, but he didn't listen!
I've never done anything like that!
Perfect!
Yeah, is this the real Jonin?
Is this guy really a Jonin?
How can I put this?
My first impression of this group?
You're a bunch of idiots.
Pass or fail? The final test!
All right, please introduce yourselves one at a time.
Introduce ourselves? Well, what are we supposed to say?
Things you like, things you don't like, things you dream of for the future,
hobbies, things like that.
Why don't you tell us first?
I mean, before we talk, tell us about you, so we can see what you want from us.
Me? I'm Kakashi Hatake.
Things I like, things I hate.
I don't feel like telling you that.
My dreams, for the first place, I never really thought of.
I have so many hobbies. I have lots of hobbies.
He's told us only his name.
Yeah!
Okay, your turn. You on the right. You first.
Let's start with you.
I'm Naruto Utsumaki.
I like instant noodles, and I'm really into ramen noodles.
Especially Ichikaru.
Sensei Ruko recommended it to me.
I hate the three minutes you have to wait for the ramen to boil.
My favorite activity is eating ramen noodles.
And my future dream is to be the greatest Hokage,
so I can feel like I have to be the greatest,
and start treating me like I'm somebody important.
Well, he's got an interesting way.
All right, next.
I'm Sakura Haruna.
What I like...
I mean, the first thing I like is...
My favorite hobby is...
My dream is to be the greatest...
And? Do you hate it?
Naruto!
Girls are much more interesting at this age than ninja art.
Last one.
My name is Sasuke Uchiha.
I hate a lot of things, and I don't like basically anything.
What I have is not a dream,
because I really make a dream come true.
And I'm going to restore your clan,
and destroy a certain someone.
Gee, I hope he wasn't talking about me.
Sasuke is so hot.
Just as I thought.
Good.
You each have your own ideas.
We'll have our first mission tomorrow morning.
What kind of mission, Sensei?
It's a task that the four of us are doing together.
What? What? What?
A survival exercise.
Survival exercise?
I thought we were supposed to have a real mission, not an exercise.
We already did this guy in the academy.
That's how we got here.
This is not like your previous training.
So, what kind of training is this?
Hey, hold on. That's a normal question.
What's so funny?
Well, if I tell you the answer,
you're going to like it.
Of the 27 graduates which just came here,
only nine will actually be accepted this year.
And the other 18 will be leading out in the center of the academy.
In other words, it's going to make it or break it,
pass or fail test,
and the chance that it will fail is at least 65%.
See? Did I tell you what you like it?
That's crazy! We were part of that test!
Believe it! What was that graduation test for anyway?
Oh, that?
That was to select the planet to my planet.
What?
That's how it is.
I decide whether to pass or fail.
You get the designated training to start a fire,
and bring your ninja to here.
Well, I'm not going to make it out.
We don't want to fail on this test.
I've got to have it.
Believe it! Believe it!
If I fail on this test, I won't see Sasuke anymore.
This is a trial of love.
That's it. This is me.
Oh.
Tomorrow you better see breakfast or else you'll kill me.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Good morning. Ready for your first day?
You're late!
Well, a black cat crossed my path. I had to take a long way.
Well.
Let's get started.
Here we go.
It's set for noon.
You're assignment is very simple.
You just have to take these bells from me.
That's all there is to it.
If you can't get by noon, you go without lunch.
You'll be tied to those posts so you'll arrive while you're in my lunch in front of you.
So that's why.
He told us not to have breakfast to make it harder on us.
Wait a minute. There's three of us.
How come there's only two of us?
Well, that means one of you will end up tied to a post and ultimately disqualified
if you don't complete your assignment.
So that one goes back to the academy.
Then again, all three of you can find out too.
You can use any weapons including shuriken.
If you're not prepared to kill me, you won't be able to take those bells.
Those weapons are too dangerous to be safe.
Well, it's dangerous.
Especially since you can't use them to stop saturation.
Class quite a bit, but with the weakest links.
You can save your clones from those low-scoring losers.
When I say start, you can begin.
Losers. Losers.
Losers. Losers.
Don't be in such a hurry.
I didn't see his start yet.
He's so fast. I didn't even see him.
So it's still Ninji.
Not bad. Maybe you'll be Ninji.
I didn't think I'd say this, but I'm actually starting to like you guys.
Get ready.
Start!
Iruka, what did you see me about?
I don't think you came here really to drink tea with me.
I wanted to chat, did you?
Naruto's the most scientist-participant.
What's their name?
Is he a tough sensei?
Kakashi?
You are concerned about him.
I am. I heard a little about his training methods.
What's this?
This is a list of all Kakashi's students.
All those who failed or passed the test.
May I have a look?
This is...
This is...
All Ninjas must know how to conceal their movements and hide their faces.
Well, they understand that much. They've hidden well.
Fool!
You and me! Right here, right now!
Let's go!
Fool it! Fool it!
Fool.
You know, compared to the others, you're a little bit weird.
Oh, yeah? I don't see weird in your hairstyle.
In the shinobi battle technique, the main thing is the power of the body.
Body?
That means the fight will be without weapons?
Then what is he looking for in the bag?
What?
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for? Move!
What?
Why are you reading a book?
Why?
To find out what happens in the story of this.
Don't let it bother you. Your weak attacks normally pass if I'm reading or whatever.
I'm going to kill you!
Now you're mine!
Ah!
Don't let your enemy be behind you.
A hand by the focus is chopper.
Because this hand of the tiger is dangerous.
He could destroy an auditor with that.
He's got a hand so like a fire in a jigsaw.
He's not just playing with us.
He's going to demolish it.
Naruto! Get out of here!
He's going to destroy you!
Too late.
Secret two-finger technique.
A thousand years of death.
I thought he was serious.
Those two are just two idiots.
Okay, where was I?
That must be the strength.
He's a giant.
We can't possibly match his strength.
I'm not going to let it end like this.
I'll attack from water.
Now!
It can't be.
This is even worse than I thought it was.
Kakashi's test may be a little difficult.
A bit more difficult?
Not a single student has ever passed his test.
That's true.
They all tried, but not one of their students
met the same standards as his.
They were all eliminated.
What are you doing now?
You know, you won't get lunch
if you don't take a bell by noon.
I know, I know.
You told us already.
You look like you don't want to be someone
who's going to surpass the Hokage.
You told us not to eat back then.
How can I fight with my servant like that?
Breakfast?
I didn't even have dinner last night.
Really bad.
I didn't even want a diet.
So you got me on guard.
That's all he was.
See that?
I'm so hungry I don't even have strength.
But I can't let that stop me.
I've got to get one of those bells without a what.
I'm going to try somehow.
Believe me, I can pass this test.
I'm not going back to the academy.
I will become a ninja.
Ha-ha!
You're over-relaxed, Sensei.
That's why you have to deal with my clones.
Seven clones?
What?
He's not images.
They're real.
How could he do that?
It looks and it's not a ghost.
They're real clones.
If you ever want to have a real sensei,
I'll kill you.
Show me what you can do, you fox!
Those aren't clones.
They're real clones.
He's mastered and he's really a jutsu.
It's a forbidden skill you've been using on Mizuki.
Great technique.
But I don't think you may take for a very long time.
You talk, you're the most narrow-tempered,
but you're still the worst student.
You can't beat me with this jutsu.
What?
He got me from behind?
Didn't you say don't let enemies get behind you?
That's right, Sensei.
Leave it!
I had one of my clones come out of the water,
but the thing behind you is so wild.
Now this is a real hit from earlier.
Why did none of them get so close?
A different...
Classic tactic.
Attention!
Your money is over the fence!
He's holding himself back.
Naruto punched himself.
Naruto!
It's you!
You're Sensei Kakashi, aren't you?
You've been part of the fear jutsu!
You are!
Take that!
You smell like your old man!
You must be him!
You're the old man!
You must be him!
You're the old man!
You're the old man!
You must be him!
You're the old man!
You must be him!
Hey!
That's not the jutsu!
That's not the jutsu!
Leave it!
And then they'll be just two of us!
Oh, no!
Sensei Kakashi!
Come on!
That's so cool!
You're the jutsu!
Why did you think of it?
That's not the jutsu!
Naruto, you are so...
Not cool.
He got you with the art of replacing the jutsu.
With this jutsu, please switch your body with the object.
So your enemy thinks he's attacking you,
and he's actually attacking himself,
leaving him open to a counter-attack.
In this case, the jutsu let himself be caught,
then switched bodies with Naruto
so that he was attacking himself.
But actually, he was just attacking himself,
and that jutsu was so cool.
He made Naruto look like a total failure.
A bell?
I must say, I think I saw a bell.
He broke the bell!
Hey!
Let me down!
What the hell?
That's crazy, this crap.
That was a trap.
Somebody!
That Jounin doesn't look like Naruto.
Even when he's fighting with a fool like Naruto.
The bell!
Think before you use the jutsu,
or else your opponent might be sitting close to you.
Oh, and also,
if the bait is a bug,
I don't think it's that easy.
A ninja must be eager to section.
I know this!
I'm telling you this because you don't get it.
You think you get it,
but you just don't understand
what's actually getting it.
Get it?
This is my chance.
He finally dropped his guard.
What would you ever learn?
He took the last blow again!
Are you out of your mind, Sasuke?
That was too far!

You'll find out about Kakashi's decision.
You don't have to write me down.
It might look bad,
but don't get me out.
