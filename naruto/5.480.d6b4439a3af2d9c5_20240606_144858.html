        <pre>Naruto
We cry for no one, we cry for no one
Our present is
Unleash the pain, unleash the heart, unleash the shadow
Breathe in, run through the darkness
Fighting and loving each other
Will never end
Moon and It Loves
Think before you act.
Or else you're a pawn in the game.
Oh, and also,
if the base is obvious,
don't get caught.
What do you want?
A ninja must be able to predict ahead.
I know!
Why do you have to remind me of that?
Listen here.
You're wasting too much energy in vain.
This is my chance.
He finally dropped his guard.
Your problem is...
A direct hit!
Are you out of your minds, okay?
You went too far!
Ugh!
He used his transformation skill.
He knew where I was hiding.
Quickly.
And what did I think?
He provoked me.
So that's where he is.
Sasuke!
He's in danger!
Maybe I'm too late?
No!
He can't catch my Sasuke!
He didn't hear me.
Sakura, behind you.
A ninja must be able to predict ahead.
Yeah, yeah!
I know!
You can't do that!
Now I won't make it to your traps!
I failed again!
You failed!
Takashi's final position!
Unlucky!
My God!
Someone there!
Where's Sensei?
What was it?
What's going on?
Sakura!
Sasuke!
Sakura!
Help me!
Please help me!
I think I'm going to get over it.
But it was okay until she was conscious.
Hmm?
Sounded like Sakura.
Shinobi battles to learn to deal with the jutsu.
Sakura studied very fast, but she still didn't see it coming.
Jutsu?
It's just simple.
It's just simple.
It's just simple.
It's just simple.
ドン, it's just eiiliation of your own fault.
It's not surprising she could't overcome it, but...
I'm not like somebody like them.
Say that, Tina.
Goodnight.
We'll see nice day on Sasuke.
command
your attack is too predictable
a trap
What?
This kid...
He's fierce.
That won't be a way to get through the textbook.
What... what happened?
What happened?
What happened?
What happened?
What happened?
What happened?
Sasuke!
He was on the verge of...
No, Sasuke!
Sasuke, no!
You've got to survive!
Please!
Where are you?
Hey, what are those things down there?
Are those our packed lunches?
Oh...
A ninja must count first.
Well, you're not as brave as they are.
Horse!
Tiger!
Fireball!
Fireball!
What?
Getting into a fireball?
That's incredible.
Can't a student have enough energy for this technique?
Where did he get?
Behind?
Above?
Where?
I'm where you least expect me to be.
Right under your feet.
Earth's element.
Headhunter jutsu.
You can't move.
That's jiu-jitsu.
The third show of love.
You have talent.
And you are very different from the others.
So if it is always better...
They say even if it sticks up,
it's the one that gets hammered down.
Great.
Sensei told us that we have to have lunch
only after we get any lunchboxes.
And if I eat it now,
it's too late to do anything.
Hi there.
I was just joking, Sensei.
Nice try.
He's stronger than I am.
I can't get out.
Sakura?
Talking head!
She's talking!
And that's my partner.
Sasuke...
You're okay!
Let go! Let go!
Enough!
I've got to get the bell to noon.
There's not much time left.
Sasuke, you're still trying to get rid of those bells?
I touched them.
Next time I'll take over.
That is really great.
I can't believe you got that.
You're amazing!
I can't believe it!
Sasuke and I are going to break up,
and I'm never going to see him again.
No!
There's not much time left.
Let's save our energy.
Maybe we should try again next year.
Okay?
I'm the only one
who can destroy him.
What?
Sensei?
You mean the Sensei?
That day
I was crying.
When were you crying?
That day I was crying.
That day I was crying.
That day I was crying.
That day I was crying.
That day I was crying.
When were you crying?
It was my head.
What?
What happened to you?
I am an avenger.
That means I'm going to be stronger than I pray.
I need something that is no time to sit back.
I need something that is no time to sit back.
I'm going to destroy one man
and destroy a certain someone.
I wasted too much time.
I wasted too much time.
Sasuke.
Uh-oh.
Stomachs are full of blood.
That's too bad.
So, my verdict?
Well, I've decided
I've decided that
I won't send any of you back
to the academy.
What?
I passed?
All I did was faint and fall over
at the same time.
Love won!
Yes, yes, yes!
Yay!
Then that means all three of us
are going to be all three of us!
Yes.
All three of you will be
running from the program
permanently.
Unbelievable.
Kakashi has never
made the same mistake.
He fails all of them.
Iruka.
This group is young.
Even I cannot say
that I'm ready to face
the dangers of ninja.
However, I think
Kakashi was correct
about all that's failed.
We're not going to be ninja!
That means we're going to have to become ninja!
We're going to have to become ninja!
You never think you can be
an enemy!
Why do you do that?
Because you don't think
you're a ninja.
You think like little kids,
like brats.
Sasuke!
You think it's all my fault?
Let go of Sasuke!
He's a bug!
You don't know what it means to be a ninja.
You think it's a game, huh?
Why do you think
you're on school?
Did you consider that question for one moment?
I don't know what you mean.
I mean,
I don't understand what these exercises
are about. Not even close.
What it's about?
Yes.
That's what determines
whether you pass or fail.
I was going to ask you that from the beginning.
Use your head.
Why do you think
three people all together
would do that?
How would we know?
We didn't make the rules.
So, I'm sick.
We just want to help each other.
That's what I know.
It's two or three people
out of the three of you
to be able to take them.
Well, anyway,
it's over.
Wait a minute.
You said it would be three people,
but only two people.
If we worked together, we would not be able
to finish two of us.
That would lead to conflict,
and the squad would break up.
Exactly. I purposely
didn't want to hurt each other.
Huh?
I wanted to see who could
go higher than their own.
But look at yourself.
Sakura.
You didn't care
about Naruto.
You just wanted to find Sasuke
and be with him.
Naruto.
You do everything
on your own.
And you, Sasuke,
considered others
as obstacles
on your way.
The mission must be done
by the team.
Of course, you must have your own skills.
You need to understand this.
When you put yourself
above the squad,
this can lead to danger and death.
For example,
Sakura,
kill Naruto or I'll kill Sasuke.
That's what happens.
Oh, boy.
I didn't know what to do.
The enemy
can not only take you hostage,
but also force you to a difficult
choice of death.
Life is always on the line.
Did you look at this stuff?
The names on the stones.
They are all
the names of the ninja heroes.
I want to be like that.
I also want my name
to be engraved in the stones.
I don't just want to die like a dog.
I want to be a hero.
They are not just heroes.
What?
What kind of heroes?
Come on, tell us.
Well, well,
they're all
K.I.A.
V.B.
That sounds cool.
It means you're in action, not died.
This is a memorial stone.
The names of my
closest friends are engraved here.
All right,
I'm going to give you
one more chance.
But I'm going to give you
lunch for the day.
You'll have three hours to get
to bed. Eat lunch now
to build up strength.
But Naruto doesn't get any.
It's your punishment
for the rules and trying to eat by yourself.
And if anyone tries to feed
that person
they will not leave you alone.
I
have the rules.
You follow them. Got it?
I'm leaving.
Iruka,
listen to me.
Whether they
listen or fail, you must not
leave Kakashi.
Right.
I'm fine.
I don't want to eat at all.
You think?
Nonsense.
Here.
What?
Sasuke, you can't.
Sensei forbade.
Kakashi's gone.
We need to use the team.
If Naruto's hungry,
he will get an effective.
That will put the team
in a crisis situation.
Sasuke.
Sakura.
Thank you.
Don't thank me.
Just eat.
But isn't that your lunch?
I'm on a diet.
Sasuke needs more than me.
Just take it, Naruto.
I can't.
My hands are tied.
Huh?
Hurry up.
He could come back in a minute.
You forced me.
That doesn't mean anything.
I understand.
You.
You broke the ban.
Take punishment.
What?
Any last words?
But you said
this.
You said that we're a group.
That's what I'm saying. That's right.
Sakura.
We're all a team.
We're all in it together.
Yeah, that's right.
The three of us are one.
Yeah, that's right.
Believe me, that's right.
The three of you are one.
That's your excuse.
You passed.
Huh?
You
passed.
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
You're the first team that passed.
The others did exactly what I said.
They didn't know how to think for themselves.
They didn't know how to think for themselves.
A ninja must
see his deception.
In our world, the criminals are
those who break the law.
That's true. But
those who abandon their friends
are worse than themselves.
These are
You know,
these kind of cool.
The exercise is over.
You've all passed.
Squad one starts its first mission tomorrow.
Yes!
I did it! I did it!
I'm a ninja!
Let's go home.
Show me!
Well, as always!
Wait!
You forgot to untie me!
Let's go home!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Watch the next episode!
Finally, we've got
And it turns out, he's starting this again, and he says, I'm only a kid, so it's me alone now, I don't want to tell you what I know about them, but I did tell him, look, someday I'll be...
Hey! Our next mission is a journey to the Land of Worms! Journey to the Land of Worms! Don't you think? Fall on, Ninja!
