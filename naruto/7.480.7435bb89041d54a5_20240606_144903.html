        <pre>Naruto
Naruto
This fog is so big. You can't see anything.
The bridge is going to fall.
Our destination is just ahead, the land of waves.
Wow! It's huge!
What? Quiet. I told you not to make noise.
Why do you think we're traveling like this?
Cutting off the engine on the oars.
Moving didn't attract attention, so they don't see us.
Mr. Tatsuno.
Before we go ahead, I want to ask you something.
The men are after you.
I need to know why.
If you don't come,
I'm afraid we'll just land you on the shore
and then we drop you ashore.
The assassin!
Naruto
I have no choice to tell you.
No, I want you to know the truth.
Like you said, this is by no means a part of your mission.
The one who seeks me is a very short man
who casts a very good memory by the shadow of the living dead.
Who is he?
You know him. At least I'm sure you've heard of him.
He's one of the world's richest men in the world.
The shipping company Gato.
Gato?
Gato Transport?
He's a business man. I've never heard of him.
Who? Who? What?
Gato.
He's a very powerful man, a very famous company that's true.
But below the surface, with the saviors,
he's the first to take over business in the United States.
He sells drugs and contraband,
using cats and ninjas.
It was one year ago when Gato first decided to occupy the world.
He came to our island,
and he immediately took control over all the transportation.
Anyone who tried to stand in his way,
simply disappeared without a trace.
In an island nation, man who controls the sea, controls everything,
but it's governed by the river,
there's one thing he has to contemplate.
When it is completed, it will join us to the land that he built,
the bridge will connect us to the great land,
and his rule will come to an end.
I am the bridge builder.
So that's the thing.
Since you're in charge of the bridge, you're standing in his dang way.
That means those guys we found in the forest,
they were working with Gato.
I don't understand.
If you knew what you were just dealing with,
why did you send a ninja to win the nation?
Why didn't you tell us?
Because the land of the waves is a small and precious nation.
Even our knowledge sits without money.
The common people who build the bridge,
they can't pay for a day of recognition.
It's too expensive.
If you end me and drop me ashore,
the bridge will be no bridge,
and I will die before I reach home.
But don't feel bad about that.
Of course, my son will laugh and say,
he'll say, he'll cry,
granddad, where's my granddad?
Ah, and my daughter will tell the ninja,
and he'll start blabbing and blaming you over and over again
for leaving her alive and giving her a life of sorrow.
Ah well, it's not your fault.
Well, I guess we have no other choice.
We'll have to keep going.
Oh, but very grateful.
Aye, we're appropriate.
Just a little bit left.
Tatsuno, we've been lucky that no one noticed us.
Nice going.
Wow!
That's as far as I'm going.
Good luck.
Right.
Thank you for the race.
Just be careful.
Okay, take me to my home,
and I'm going to be there more than this.
Right.
The next time, it's going to be more serious.
There'll be much more.
It's going to be an unbeatable killer.
Right.
I'm not going to stop to show them what I'm capable of.
Believe me.
Over there!
Surya!
Damn it, it's a rat.
Rat? We've known that for a long time.
You're so stupid.
Naruto, those are not toys.
They're dangerous.
Stop trying to scare me!
You!
Hey, is someone hiding over there?
No, over there!
Hey!
Over there!
That's it, Surya!
What?
What are you doing?
There's someone watching us.
Yeah, right.
Quit lying and acting like you don't care.
Naruto, what did you do?
A rabbit!
Oh, my poor little rabbit.
I'm so sorry.
There's so much stuff going on here.
All sorts of things.
That's a snow rabbit.
But the color,
they only have winter.
During winter,
when the days are sure to be as little as summer.
This rabbit was raised in the woods,
leaving a light,
a replacement,
I suppose.
So, they're already here.
Now, it's clear who was playing the devil.
It's the Kakashi,
copying the ninja from the village of the invisible leaves.
Look out!
That must be...
Here it is!
My chance to show I believe it!
I'm ready this time!
I'm ready to go to Sasuke!
Well, well, this is Zabu Damamoto
from the road ninja from the village of the hidden Shinobi.
Road ninja?
Shinobi!
Ready?
Go!
You're in the way.
Get back.
He's not like those other ninja.
He's in a whole other league.
If he's our road ninja, we'll only use this.
This kind of a touch is.
Kakashi by the name of Serengan,
if I'm not mistaken.
It's too bad,
but you'll have to have an old man with you over there.
That's right.
What is that?
Serengan!
What's he saying?
Does he have some special powers?
Shari, what?
Now quick!
Bridge builder,
stay out of this fight.
I taught you teamwork, and that's what I needed.
I'm ready.
What is that in his eye?
Well, let's see what this Serengan is.
Serengan.
This isn't scary.
Everyone's saying Serengan, Serengan.
What is that?
Serengan, however, is a rare thing.
It resides in his eye.
The user has a vision of Dojutsu,
or dojutsu.
If he has Serengan, he can buy a pair of raspberry pants
and immediately see any Genjutsu, Taizutsu, and Minjutsu,
and he can fight the attacker back with any attack.
However, not everyone has a special, rare form of dojutsu.
And if you think about it, Serengan can be bigger.
However, there's much more Serengan than that, a lot more.
You got it right, boy.
But the young man has the surface.
You see, Serengan is also able to analyze the opponent's technique
and copy it to the smallest details.
As for you, my colleague,
you're Zyonin from the Utei-Zyutai department,
so there's an option to open fire to defeat.
You've been working with us for a long time.
With your things, you're already aware of the case of a thousand dojutsu,
Kakashi, the copying ninja.
What?
Wow!
Is our Sensei such a famous ninja?
Wow, that's so cool!
Wait a minute.
The Serengan is only used by the ninja from the Utei clan.
My clan?
Could he be...
Enough talking.
I need to explain to your grandpa.
Now, we're going to kill him.
So, I left the order for the first day, Kakashi.
So be ready.
He's over there!
Standing on the water!
He's building up a strong charge.
Ninja heart!
Ninja in the fog!
He vanished!
Sensei!
He'll come after me first.
But who is he?
Zabu Zamamochi.
He used to be in the team of killers in the village of the hidden fogs.
He's a big fan of killing without noise.
Without noise?
As the names of the dojutsu.
Everything happens in one moment, without noise or any kind.
It's so fast, Chik.
And you're already in the heavens.
The Serengan cannot even help you.
So keep your ears sharp.
Well, if we fail and we lose our minds...
What are you saying?
The fog is getting worse.
What are you saying?
The fog is getting worse.
The land of waves is surrounded by the ocean.
The swirling fog is like in London.
Sensei!
Eight points.
What? Who said that?
Larynx.
Spine.
Bones.
Liver.
Stomach.
Liver.
Stomach.
Liver.
Heart.
Heart.
Which will be my kill point?
What an intense, blood-sucking cue.
One shallow and one tiny wink of your eye is enough to bring on instant death.
If it goes on like this, I'll go insane.
I'll go insane.
I'll go insane.
I'll go insane.
I'll go insane.
I'll go insane.
I'll go insane.
I'll go insane.
If I go on like this I'll go insane.
One shallow and one tiny wink of your eye is enough to bring on instant death.
If it goes on like this I'll go insane.
I'll go insane.
I'll go insane.
I'll go insane.
I'll go insane.
I'll go insane.
I'll go insane.
I'll go insane.
I'll go insane.
I'll go insane.
Everything's gonna be okay. Trust me.
I wouldn't be so stupid.
It's over.
It's over.
Sensei, behind you!
Die!
It's over.
The water of the water clone.
It's awful.
Even in the fog.
He saw through what I'm doing, and he just copied.
Don't move.
Now it's over.
The end.
The end.
The end.
The end.
The end.
The end.
The end.
Oh, no, it's not over.
Kakashi Sensei fell for the Zabuze trick.
I must run, or I'll be transcribed too.
It hurts.
Hey, what am I doing? I've made up my mind.
I won't run no matter what.
Next time, the oath of pain.
Nothing's gonna stop me.
Believe it!
