Naruto
Where are we?
The restricted area for passage.
You are at the site of the second stage of the exam.
The 44th site of practice.
Its other name is the forest of death.
The forest of death?
It looks like a moth.
And also on top of the grass.
The forest of death.
Anahamaru!
What did you forget in such a deafening?
Yes, this is the guy I can rely on.
How great you have bitten us!
There's too much powder!
Adults are attractive.
Kunoichi from the senior group Moegi.
I really like the distribution of multipliers.
The name is Udon.
The most brilliant ninja village, Kanahamaru!
All together we are the team of Kanahamaru!
What are you doing here all the time?
I'm just passing the second stage of the exam.
The selection of tunas.
I'm too busy to play with you.
We came here not to have fun.
We came here to collect material.
Yes, yes.
Material?
We were entrusted with preparing a special article
for the class newspaper about the selection of tunas.
Therefore, we came to collect material about you and your detachment.
We ask for cooperation.
We beg you.
But...
Hey, what are you doing there?
Kanahamaru is talking about some materials for the class newspaper.
Yes, I completely forgot.
Mr. Hokage told me about it.
So, now is a 10-minute break.
Let's go meet our material collector.
Let's help them.
What is it?
People, brother, we beg you very much.
Yes, I understand.
Well, if that's the case, then I'll show you my charm in all its glory.
You should definitely see a live report from the forest of death.
The school newspaper of the Konoha village.
Here is the chapter on getting acquainted with the characters.
Well, first of all, I ask you to introduce yourself.
Okay.
My name is Utsumaki Naruta.
I am a ninja from a village hidden in the forest.
My hobby is to waste time in the abyss.
I really love ramen.
I have just become a genius,
but my dream is to become Hokage.
Moreover, I will surpass all the previous Hokage
and all the inhabitants of the village will recognize my greatness.
At the ninja academy, I was constantly told something like,
yes, so that you would fail, moron, and so on.
But I with a shine passed the graduation exam,
and now I spend the days facing the face to face with difficult missions.
Distance to the goal.
5 meters.
Ready at any time.
Sasuke and Sakura are also part of the 7th squad,
but since only I am active,
you can not pay attention to them.
I caught you!
Don't say that!
Imagine them as they should be.
I got it, I got it.
Well, for example,
Sasuke Uchiha, who is the last remaining
representative of the famous Uchiha clan,
but in fact he is such a helpless guy.
So that was when I turned into him?
But the main thing is that you understand
all the coolness of my Nijutsu.
This is Haruna Sakura-chan,
who is in love with me.
Yes, of course, it is said that the words
I hate, I hate, mean I love,
it's about her, and she can not open
her true feelings to me.
Is this true?
True, true, of course, true!
Who is in love with this people?
Idiot, damn you!
Well, we represent one team
that copes with various dangerous missions.
Oh, you!
Auntie, I spilled all the weeds!
Something happened?
These are not weeds, these are medicinal herbs
that I grew in my garden.
We will destroy them all!
At ease!
Here is the oak, the field with traps,
I told you not to go there!
I beg you!
Here is the fool.
After all, he does not have such a huge dog on his teeth.
This is called Jengiru's mission.
Why does it all look like that?
As if you are a fool.
Well, that happens too.
Come on, one more time.
Transformation!
This is just the moment
when I was wrong, Uncle Hokage!
Yes, all this nonsense is not good for articles.
What?
Okay, you try to give an example.
So, my name is Konohamaru.
I am the grandson of the head of the village of Grandpa Hokage.
My name is Konoha Gakure,
and he is Hokage in the third generation.
The man who presides over the legacy of the Hokage name
is the best ninja in the village,
especially the fourth Hokage,
the hero who saved the village from the forest of monsters.
Well, wait, you're talking about anyone,
but not about yourself.
And you, brother, talk too much,
only about yourself.
Well, of course, I'm the main character,
what do I have to do with the rest?
That's like Naruto.
He graduated from the academy
and began to forget about me.
But you can tell me a little about me.
Yes, this is the first person in the village
He is a very good person.
He always treats me noodles, ramen,
in a cafe and tirak.
Am I a good person only because I treat you ramen?
Stop fooling around.
Brother, let's talk about something else.
Well, yes.
Well, what else can I tell you?
Well, let's talk about the clumsy Sasuke or something.
Oh, this is Naruto.
He must be talking about all kinds of things.
Hmm, I don't know.
Here is a cool Kakashi.
How is your situation?
Here is a cute Sakura.
Now Naruto is somehow connected.
What about you? Are you in time?
I can deliver it to the CM.
Please tell him that there is a very nice gift.
Understood.
Kakashi-sensei.
Kakashi-sensei, answer me.
What happened?
He said he would come back to CM.
It can not be helped. Sakura, you continue.
What? Me?
Why are you there?
Well, it can not be helped. I'll do it.
The head of the army.
The material about the Shinobi technique.
And now my favorite Haruno Sakura will tell you about Nijutsu.
And now my favorite Haruno Sakura will tell you about Nijutsu.
Yes, I'm a cute kunaiti Haruno Sakura.
Cute?
What? Are there any objections?
No, not at all.
Transformation!
So, first I'll tell you about Nijutsu Naruto.
Technique of seduction.
Technique of shadow division.
Technique of shadow division.
Transformation!
Transformation!
Haruno, technique of garam.
Name it!
Can you name the technique of garam?
And also this.
People who are late do bad things.
Throwing brushes two sacks.
Next, I will tell you about the newcomer number one.
Who graduated from the academy perfectly.
Sasuke kun.
Such an obvious attack is useless.
The most popular in the class, Sasuke kun,
is fighting on equal terms with Kakashi-sensei himself.
What a cool Sasuke kun!
You are too long a story about Sasuke.
Naruto, shut up!
Technique of big fireball.
What?
Is the genius able to use such a technique?
He still should not have enough for this chakra.
I'm sorry.
Syuriken of wind demon.
Wind mill of darkness.
It is absolutely useless against me
to use all kinds of syurikens.
Well, let's start?
It can not be!
It's a syringan!
So, what is a syringan?
If it is the same syringan
that Kakashi-sensei inherited,
then he will figure out the technique of this fat brow.
Genjutsu or ninjutsu,
whatever it is, it's some kind of magic.
I will explain it now.
What you have just seen is the technique
of Koton-Oku-Akaku.
Technique of Fuumusyuriken,
Kage-Fusya, syringan.
But he uses a lot of other techniques of ninjutsu.
But the coolest among them is this one of his sharp eyes.
If he looks at a girl with such an eye,
he will drive anyone crazy.
Sasuke-kun, look here!
Listen, get away!
Well, such a cold attitude
gives him even more attractiveness.
So, the next one is Sensei Hatake Kakashi.
His second name is a copying ninja.
He recognizes the technique of the enemy with a syringan
that is in his left eye
and says that he has already copied more than a thousand techniques.
But he never comes at a certain time.
And when he has free time,
he immediately reads some suspicious book called
Kaketli-Wai-Rai and looks like he doesn't want to do anything.
Secret technique of Taijutsu of the village of Kanoho.
Wait for me!
His biggest secret is the part of his face hidden by a mask.
I wonder what it looks like.
Ninpo Kujyose.
An element of the earth, a technique of looking for a bell.
If it is impossible to detect with both eyes and ears,
you should use your nose.
You are in such a position now,
because your inner eyes are closed.
This is my personal technique of calling for pursuit.
Why does he have a syringan in his left eye
that is passed down only in the Uchiha family?
Why does he have a syringan in his left eye
that is passed down only in the Uchiha family?
This person has a secret on a secret.
Almost nothing is known about him.
You will need to ask him next time.
What kind of chakra is in his hand?
Why is it visible to the eye?
You are too dangerous.
The technique of Suiro has been missed.
The technique of Suiro has been missed.
Hidyutsu.
My demon mirror made of crystal ice.
The other princes also have a lot of their own techniques,
but there are so many that it will not be enough time to tell about them.
but there are so many that it will not be enough time to tell about them.
The head of the battles, information about the rivals.
The head of the battles, information about the rivals.
Let's ask Mr. Sasuke to say a few words
that he seems to have thought about the future.
But in the end I somehow had to correct the situation.
But in the end I somehow had to correct the situation.
That's what I thought from the very beginning.
Why does he charge himself with the price?
You are a rare moron, Sasuke.
It's none of your business.
Shut up!
I will not allow only you to appear in the report.
But why didn't you see the cool enemies around you?
But why didn't you see the cool enemies around you?
What are you talking about?
Look at this.
What's your name there?
Sabakuna Gaara.
I was also interested in you.
What's your name?
Uchiha Sasuke.
Hey there, call me.
Damn it!
Why are they always talking to Sasuke again?
Before asking someone's name, you should call yourself.
Hey you, with an evil expression of the eyes.
Hey you, with an evil expression of the eyes.
What about the fight?
Here and now.
Leave me that fat guy.
I don't want to fight you, but Uchiha.
Stop repeating the same thing.
Sasuke, Sasuke, I'm tired of it.
Really, no one even considers our leader as the main character.
They are all blind, they have holes in their eyes.
Yeah, you're always talking in vain.
It's nothing like that.
Kanohareppu!
Look, isn't it an empty chatterbox?
Sakurotian!
The participants who gathered to pass the exam for the selection of junins
all have excellent preparation.
Narasikamaru.
Akimete Chodji.
Inuzuka Hinata.
Inuzuka Kiba and Akamaru.
Aburameshino.
If you continue to act the same way as before,
then you definitely won't be able to win.
Of course I can.
It's better for you to be more attentive,
or you'll blow some snitch away.
Of course.
We have passed the first stage of the exam for the selection of junins.
We are heading to the second stage.
And we are not at all afraid of the difficulties that await us there.
We will definitely pass this exam.
And you will see, we will become junins.
There is no doubt about it.
After all, we are a friendly group that can work together.
You will still hear us.
Come on, let's go!
Thank you for your cooperation in the selection of the material.
Thank you.
Leader, come on, don't let me down.
Yeah, you can rely on me.
Goodbye, see you next time.
Goodbye, good luck.
Alright, guys, sorry for being late.
I was talking to a cute girl on the way,
and she came back.
Don't say that.
I brought a VTR.
Give me a compliment.
Mr. Kagai, you're great!
I can continue with this!
Everyone, please look forward to it!
Before that, do a commercial.
Thank you for watching!
See you next time!
Thank you for watching!
See you next time!
The light was born, the darkness was born
Two are one
Harmonia
Telepathy
Hey, can you hear me?
The 44th practice room.
Nicknamed Shinomori.
From now on, it will be a serious match between shinobi and shinobi!
I'm getting excited!
I'm getting more and more excited!
I will survive the survival in the forest!
Next time, the second test starts!
Everyone around is full of enemies!
I'm going to win again!
