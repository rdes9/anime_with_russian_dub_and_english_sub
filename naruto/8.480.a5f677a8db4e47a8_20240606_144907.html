        <pre>Leave me alone
Naruto
I'm in a hurry so I can end this
My dry heart is borrowing
Not for anyone, not for anyone
From now on, we will
Untie the pain, untie the heart, untie the shadow
Breathe in, run through the darkness
Fighting and loving will never end
All the way
I wanna rock
Rock in my heart
I wanna rock
I feel it
One shot, one move and it's enough to dry his attire
It's suffocating
It's been going on for two days, going insane
The clutches are pulling him to death
I've never felt anything so chilling
Because my own life is so dark
I can't take it any further
Saska, calm down
I'll protect you in my life and for all of you
I will not allow my comrades to die
Trust me
I wouldn't be so sure
Saska
It's over, don't worry
Saska
Sensei, behind you!
I got nothing to do with that
The water glider can't be
Don't move
Now, it's over.
You're a curse!
You're finished.
Hooray!
Huh?
It's over?
You don't seem to understand.
Your technique is nothing but a rough fake.
I can't beat a cheap imitator like you.
You don't stop surprising me.
You don't copy my Zyutsu until you make a speech.
I'll pretend to be with my life and with all of you.
Very high-quality.
You made the clone speak to attract attention.
Well, he'd been hiding in the fog and waiting for me to start acting.
Well done.
But I'm not that easy to fool.
Hey, that one's a clone too!
One more!
What?
Huh?
Makibisi's spikes?
Trying to stop me, you fool.
Sensei!
I can't beat a flashy sensei like him!
He has a good physical condition.
This isn't normal water.
It's dense.
Hey!
You fool!
Zyutsu of the water prison?
No!
I mean...
The scape of the water?
I shouldn't have been hiding under the water.
This prison is made of water, but it's stronger than steel.
It's hard to get out of it.
It's hard to fight when you can't move.
So much for that, dear Kakashi.
We'll finish you off later.
But first, we're going to deal with your little friends.
Zyutsu of the water prison?
He's even more stupid than I thought.
You think you've put on a bandage and you're already a ninja?
When you come between life and death so many times that you don't care anymore,
then you'll be called a ninja.
When you become so dangerous, even for me,
then maybe you deserve to be called a ninja.
He just disappeared again!
You're just too weak.
Naruto!
Naruto!
Naruto!
Naruto!
Naruto!
Naruto!
Naruto!
Listen.
Get the rest of the builders and run.
You can't beat him.
He needs all the power to keep me from getting out of prison.
He can only fight with his clone,
but the clone can't go far away from his original.
If you get away from him, he can't follow you.
Run!
Run away?
Not an option.
That became unthinkable the moment you were caught.
It doesn't matter how fast we run,
or how far he finds us and destroys us.
If we take the Manji defense formation, he can get around it in an instant.
In the end, if we're alone, we're finished.
Our only chance to survive is to rescue you.
We've got to do this.
D.vae!
Take that.
That was easy.
Sasuke, no!
He got Sasuke!
So this is what you're going to need, a true ninja.
I've got to get away, if you don't see me, he'll probably make me a beefsteak.
I swear by the blood of this wound, I will never back down again.
I will never back down again, and no one will ever have to pass away to me.
I will never run away.
You're not hurt, are you?
Skinny cat.
And I will not lose you, Sasuke.
Hmm.
I can try your bandage on, I really want to.
Oh, this? No way.
You can only wear this bandage when you graduate from the academy and become a ninja.
Naruto, come over here for a minute.
I've got something special I want to give you.
Congratulations.
You've graduated.
That's what happens.
An enemy takes a hostage, an enemy takes a hostage, and you have to make a choice.
Every mission is a risk for life.
You've passed.
I'm not the same guy you used to be all the time.
I'm a ninja now, I want to be a ninja.
To be the greatest hokage, then the whole village is going to respect me like I'm somebody.
Somebody important.
That's right, I'm a ninja now.
Believe it.
I swore I wouldn't run away.
I won't run away.
Naruto, no!
Naruto, what are you doing?
Fool.
No!
What are you saying? You're using an enemy and you know it!
We're some kind of new kids!
We were born into this, don't you think?
What do you think you'd accomplished by that?
The headband?
That's what he wanting?
Hey you, the freak with no eyebrows!
So sick!
Put this in your nose!
The ninja who will become Hakage of the village of invisible foxes!
Never!
He never back down!
His name is Naruto Uzumaki!
Naruto?
I thought he was so-so.
But this kid's got us!
Alright Sasuke, listen up!
Listen to me!
Yeah, I hear that.
I've got a plan!
Now he's got a plan.
So you're fine with being in his teamwork, huh?
Why do I have this feeling?
Naruto's so... determined!
Alright, guys, let's go!
Let's beat him up!
Okay, ready?
Let's bring him to the stage!
You're gonna get to me!
You think you can do it?
This isn't fair!
What are you doing?
You done?
This fight is over, move it on!
Now, take them out of here!
You're nothing compared to who the hell you are!
It's not fair!
You're nothing compared to who the hell you are!
It's to save the pre-builder!
Stay on your mission!
The pre-builder?
Well, I guess you're stuck because of me.
Because of my desire to live, of course.
Well, okay, if that's the case.
For God's sake, with my life!
Go ahead and help your sensei!
Alright, you hear that?
Yeah, I'm ready, you ready?
You guys are just learning to be stupid.
Still pretending to be ninjas,
pretending to be ninjas,
pretending to be ninjas,
this man already crushed many opponents.
Zabuza, the shaitan!
So, you've also noticed me.
Long ago, in a village hidden in the fog,
also known as the village of blood fog,
before you could become a ninja,
Hickey was one final test.
So, you've heard about our exam?
What kind of exam?
What's the big deal, then?
We had a grand exam, too!
Did you have to get your classmate soaked, too?
Imagine, young ninjas like you live together,
they train together,
and then come for an exam.
That's the rule.
You or him, or he or you.
And you can't pass the exam
while your classmate is still breathing.
He or she was your friend,
and now it's either you or him.
Ten years ago, the village hidden in the mist,
the village of blood fog changed.
A year before that,
one dark force filled the school with terror.
What's he saying?
What evil?
What kind of evil?
What kind of terror?
One young boy who was not even a ninja
who was fighting that ninja
who approached the class
and took down over a hundred of teachers.
It... it felt so good.
I liked it.
Sasuke!
Terreux
You are nothing!
Stop!
Shattou Clones!
Ah, the glasses of hell!
And there's quite a few of them here.
Here we go!
Ah!
Ah!
There's two of them.
He's too strong for them to beat him.
I've got something else for you!
Sasuke!
So that was a plan.
Not bad.
Huh?
Shuriken Jaemonvetra!
Windmill of ghosts!
Ah!
Shuriken?
You can't touch me like that.
Ah!
So he was aiming at me, not at the clone.
Smart.
But not smart enough.
Huh?
A second Shuriken.
He hid behind the first one.
Shuriken's shadow is a ghost.
The second Shuriken's on target.
He can't catch this one.
I told you, Shuriken can't catch me.
Ah!
He dodged it!
Hmm.
What?
What?
There you go!
Ah!
Shuriken Jaemonvetra!
Windmill of ghosts!
Ah!
Shuriken Jaemonvetra!
Windmill of ghosts!
Ah!
Shuriken Jaemonvetra!
Windmill of ghosts!
Ah!
Shuriken Jaemonvetra!
Windmill of ghosts!
Ah!
Shuriken Jaemonvetra!
Windmill of ghosts!
Don't cry, cause you're so right.
Don't try with fake so fears, cause you will hate yourself in the end.
Don't try to look so wise.
Don't cry, cause you're so right.
Don't try...
Yeah!
My plan worked!
I need you to see what I've done.
After all, I managed to trick Zabudzu.
You saw it yourself.
Zyutsu of the invisible leaf.
Author of Naruto Uzumaki.
Fact.
So, Sensei, we freed you.
And then you decide for yourself.
In the next episode.
Kakashi. Ninja.
With Siren Gun.
My first big victory.
