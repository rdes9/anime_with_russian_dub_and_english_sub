        <pre>Naruto
Shinobi
Well, today it's time to get down to business!
Maho-go!
We're breaking into a new chapter!
The exam is on Tune!
Good morning, Sakura-chan!
Well, again...
These two, since they came back from the country,
behave strangely.
It doesn't suit me at all.
Hurry up and come, Kakashi-sensei!
You're such an idiot!
Good morning, everyone!
I got lost today, you know.
Well, in short, Kakashi-sensei,
don't you think that we, the seventh team,
have been getting some easy tasks lately?
I can be more active.
Don't you have something hotter?
Well, something like this.
So that my ninja path is like this.
So that my spirit is like this.
Well, yes, yes, yes.
I understand what you mean.
So...
Damn it!
I'm in debt with him on every task.
But I won't give up!
Not at all!
Grubian...
I really want to tell him that!
You constantly have to help!
Iris, this will definitely happen today!
Naruto!
What are you doing there?
It's time for the task!
Why are you making so much noise all the time?
Who cares, Sasuke!
I definitely won't give up!
He-he-he!
Hey, you!
Hey, old lady!
Yeah, I made it all the way to a single seed!
What happened?
It's not a seed.
What?
It's the medicinal herbs that I grew in my garden!
It hurts!
Oh, no!
Oh, no!
Oh, no!
Oh, no!
It hurts!
Oh, no!
Oh, no!
Oh, no!
Why are you doing this?
You are just making a mess!
You are just making a mess!
Wow!
Wow!
Okay, I give up!
I have to do it again!
I'm sorry, I tried to do it again!
I'm sorry, I tried to do it again!
Here's Dubin.
The field with traps. The entrance is prohibited.
I told you not to go there!
Please!
What a fool.
He doesn't have teeth anymore.
Such a huge dog.
I told you to wait!
There's a field with traps!
The field with traps.
Naruto, is it all because you keep bending the stick?
You constantly have to help.
If you go on rampaging, I'll kill you.
Yeah...
Lately, the work in the team has been completely violated.
That's right! That's right!
Sasuke, you're the one who's violating the team work.
You're constantly getting into their business.
No, it's all you, Dubin.
If you don't want to stay in debt in front of me...
Isn't it better for you to become stronger than me?
It looks like they've stopped climbing for a long time.
Damn it, I'm tired of it.
There are so many ninjas around that are stronger than me.
And I'm here with these stupid tasks.
Well, let's get going.
I still have to submit a report on today's task, so...
If that's the case, I'm going home.
Sasuke, wait!
Listen, I've been thinking...
Maybe now we can explore the work in the team together?
And you're the same as Naruto.
The same as Naruto.
Next time you decide to play with me,
you'd better practice some technique.
To be honest, your abilities are even worse than Naruto.
Worse than Naruto.
Worse than Naruto.
Worse than Naruto.
But that's the way it is.
There is not a single task that I would have done better than everyone else.
Sakura-chan!
Get Sasuke out of here!
Let's finish the training course together!
Sensei is gone.
Maybe he did it on purpose for us.
Did he want to turn into a rock?
Is it really possible for a rock to have such a correct rectangular shape,
and with two holes in front of it?
Yes, that's what I expected.
It's a worthy opponent.
Still, we went too far with the powder.
Learning adult romance!
Kunoichi from the group Moegi!
Favorite technique of multiplication and division.
Name Udon!
The most talented in the ninja village!
Konohamaru!
All together, we are the Konohamaru team!
I thought so, the Konohamaru group.
Why are you all wearing glasses?
We decided to dress the same way as you did before.
What is this?
You've been reacting to us a little cold lately.
Are you here to see me?
See, I told you, he ignores us.
Are you free now, leader?
No, I have a class now.
What?
Moegi, you said we were going to play ninja today!
What? Really?
What can I do?
If I start playing with them, it will last all day.
How is this ninja going to play ninja?
What are you saying?
And even though I'm worse than him.
When she looks at me like that, I get redder.
Brother, what kind of girl is this?
She looks at him with such eyes as if she wants to eat.
Brother, don't hide from us.
She's your girlfriend.
And you are very promising for myriads.
This is not true!
Brother!
What are you doing?
No, no, leader!
Pulse, pulse!
You're ugly, ugly!
Ugly!
Inner Sakura
Konohamaru-kun, are you okay?
Ouch, ouch, ouch!
She's so angry at the word ugly.
Does she think that after this girl?
Ouch, ouch, ouch!
It probably hurts.
Well, in general, it is accepted.
And how about Naruto?
Does he manage to get along with his friends?
Well, a little.
And I've been so busy lately.
After his return, I haven't met him even once.
So I'm a little worried.
As you know, Sasuke is in a team with him, so he often fools around trying to compete with Naruto.
But as a result, his abilities quickly grow.
So quickly that he will soon be able to catch up with you.
He respects you so much.
That's right.
What's that?
What?
Soon?
Sweet chestnuts.
What's that?
What's that?
What's that?
Oh, you.
Konohamaru!
It hurts, doesn't it?
Stop it, or there will be problems later.
I'm sorry, it's all my fault.
Who are they anyway?
Come on, quickly take your hands off him!
It seems that these are geniuses from the village of leaves.
While there are problems, I want to have a little fun.
Let go of me!
And you are lively, little girl.
Oh, you bitch!
What was that just now?
What's that?
It's a little weak somehow.
Geniuses from the leaves.
Yes, they are not from here at all.
What are they doing here?
Konohamaru!
Konohamaru-chan!
Konohamaru-kun!
Konohamaru-kun!
It's not pleasant at all.
If you don't let him go now, I'll never forgive you for that, you moron!
You're a moron yourself, what are you going to do after your threats?
You're sick.
I can't stand kids at all.
You are so small and insolent.
I want to break them all.
I don't participate in this.
What is he? What a horror!
After this slander, I will accept for those annoying curses.
Oh, you!
Oh, you!
Have you forgotten something in your village?
Sasuke-kun!
You're so cute.
Brother!
Another annoying slander.
Get lost.
What a cutie!
Naruto, brother!
You're not cool at all.
Stupid, I would definitely do him in two counts.
Damn you, Sasuke!
Why are you always getting in the way?
Get down, kid.
I hate smart people like you the most in the world.
Hey, did you decide to use a raven?
Kankuro, stop it.
You're a disgrace to our village.
Ga... Gaara!
How could he be so inconspicuously near me?
The same theft as Yukakase.
Love.
The reason I gathered you here,
your faces and your nods,
I realized that you already understood what the reason was.
Yes, it seems that the time has come.
After all, other villages have already been notified, haven't they?
Yes, but they are lined up in our village there and there.
And when?
In a week.
Again so quickly.
So, I will report as follows.
In seven days, on July 1, the Tsunin exam begins.
The Tsunin exam begins.

Alas.
Telekinesis now!

Tokyo went well.
Wow.
All the best.
Really? What are you going to do with your burning clothes?
Wait! I won't let you get away!
Next episode!
The strong enemies have appeared!
I'm going to be active again!
