Naruto
We cry for no one, we cry for no one
We cry for pain, for heart, for shadow
We cry for life, we cry for death
We cry for war, we cry for love
We cry for no one
We cry for love, for heart, for shadow
You have defamed the honor of our village. Why do you think we came here?
But listen, Gara, these scoundrels started attacking us first.
Shut up!
I'll kill you.
Got it. I'm stupid. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
Hey, you. Don't be offended, okay?
I don't like this guy at all. His eyes. And this guy is great.
It's not so easy to get into a competition with a stone.
Let's go. We didn't come here to have fun.
Yeah, I know.
Wait a minute.
What do you want?
Judging by your clothes, you are ninjas from the village, hidden in the sand.
The state of fire and wind are of course allies, but their free visit to foreign states should be prohibited legally.
Tell me why you came, otherwise I...
That's what it means to walk under the beacon. Don't you know anything?
Here's the entrance visa.
As you said, we are ninjas from the village, hidden in the sand, in the state of wind.
We came here to take the exam for the selection of prisoners.
Exam for the selection of prisoners?
Name it! The appearance of strong opponents!
What kind of exam for the selection of prisoners?
You really don't know anything.
Brother, if you pass this exam, you will become a prisoner of prisoners.
Really? Well, then I'll try to pass it too.
Hey, you there. What's your name?
Mine?
Not yours. There's that guy with that garland on his back.
Sabakuna Gaara.
I was also interested in you. What's your name?
Uchiha Sasuke.
Come on, come on! Ask about my name!
I'm not interested.
It's getting more and more interesting.
Honohamaru, do I really look weak?
Compared to my brother Sasuke? Yes.
Sasuke! I won't let you down!
Why are you so excited?
Well, what do you think?
I think they are not dangerous, although ...
Behind the black hair from the village of leaves and pumpkin garland from the village of hidden sands is worth following.
So, before the start of the exam on the selection of prisoners, I will ask the responsible for the new geniuses to go ahead.
Kakashi, Kurenai, Asuma.
What do you say?
Are there any in your command of the geniuses that you would like to recommend?
It's not worth even talking about it.
But formally, the geniuses who have completed eight more tasks can be moved to the exam.
Well, of course, it is usually required to perform more tasks to prepare for the exam, but ...
There's nothing to say. It's too early for them.
Well, let's start with Kakashi.
Kakashi is the leader of the seventh squad.
Uchiha Sasuke.
Utsumaki Naruta.
Haruno Sakura.
Three of the above are recommended by me to take part in the exam on the tuning under my name, Hatake Kakashi.
Kurenai is the leader of the eighth squad.
Kyuga Hinata.
Inuzuka Kiba.
Aburaga Sina.
Three of the above will take part under the name of Yuhi Kurenai.
Asuma is the leader of the tenth squad.
Yamanaka Ino.
Akimichi Tetsu.
Three of the above will also take part in the exam under my name, Surutobi Asuma.
Each recommended three of them to the beginners to take part in such an exam?
It was not five years!
Wait a minute.
What, Iruko, Mr. Hakage, let me say a few words.
Perhaps this may seem too inappropriate, but the nine people mentioned now in the academy were under my responsibility.
Undoubtedly, they are very talented students, but they are still too early.
They still need to accumulate experience before they are admitted to the exam.
When I became a tuning, I was six years younger than Naruto.
Naruto is not like you at all!
Do you want to crush him?
When performing important tasks, they constantly show their dissatisfaction.
Let them have fun once, meeting face to face with pain.
What are you talking about?
Well, it was just a joke.
Iruko Sensei.
I also understand what you want to say.
It must be annoying for you, but ...
Kakashi, enough already!
It is useless to interfere.
They are no longer your students.
Now they are my subordinates.
What a disgusting guys!
But this exam is not for nothing called ...
Iruko, I understand what you want to say.
Mr. Hakage, so I decided to arrange a preliminary exam for new geniuses.
Preparatory exam?
What is it?
Why does he call us himself, and then all the time makes us wait?
That's it!
I fell asleep and did not take a bath because of this.
How can he understand such things?
And because I overslept, I did not even wash my face and did not brush my teeth.
Listen, you are dirty.
Why are they so tense early in the morning?
Good morning everyone!
Why did I get lost on the road today?
Yes! So we believed you!
What's wrong with you?
Well, okay, I'll tell you right away.
You are recommended to pass the exam on the selection of juniors, so here is your application.
Juniors exam?
However, this recommendation is not for nothing.
You are recommended to pass the exam on the selection of juniors, so here is your application.
However, this recommendation is not for nothing.
You are recommended to pass the exam on the selection of juniors, so here is your application.
Yes! Kakashi-sensei, I love you so much!
Stop it! Let me go!
Only those who want to take part, sign these applications.
Then, on the 5th, until 15.00, you must come to the 301st auditorium of the school.
That's all.
Juniors exam! Juniors exam!
Utsumaki Naruto is selected to take part in the exam on the selection of juniors under the name of Hatake Kakashi.
Juniors exam? There will probably be a lot of strong guys there.
For example, that one.
Or that one.
Like this! I will never lose to anyone!
If I win here, then Hatake will fall with his hand!
Still, I should assign the title to Naruto, and it's time for me to leave the department.
Maybe I can fight him.
I don't want to.
I can't even catch up with Sasaki and Naruto, and the juniors exam?
Bad, bad, bad.
Let's go!
Brother Naruto, let's play together!
Come on, there are no tasks today, I haven't had any fun for a long time.
Hooray!
CC by Daddy
Leader
roleplay Kanoh-maru
anyone
Are you going to deal with Moegi
Hey you! Let them go Moegi
Damn! Let's run after him
Kanoh-maru
Wait
Ah yes
What's going on?
Maybe we should go for a walk?
No way!
Are you serious?
They're so fast!
Wait for me!
Moegi!
Where are you going, bro?
What's going on?
What's going on?
What's going on?
What's going on, bro?
Did we get lost?
Let me go!
If I could take part in the exam on the tunin in the village hidden in the forest, then...
You caught up with me quickly!
And you, fat old man!
What are you going to do with Moegi?
What am I going to do?
Do you really want to know?
Don't move!
Don't move!
Why are you doing this?
I need a stamp for the first hakage.
I'll give the girl in exchange for it.
A stamp?
Sasuke-kun!
Why did you suddenly call me?
Sakura,
give up the exam.
It's too early for you.
Yeah, I think so too.
You need a lot of experience for this exam.
A mistake can cost you your life.
Sasuke-kun!
Are you worried about me?
You're so caring!
Well, kind of.
Isn't it too much to show?
Go away if you don't want to die.
Don't throw words!
Don't be angry with me.
Sasuke-kun!
Don't test my patience.
Sasuke-kun!
Sasuke-kun!
Sasuke-kun!
Sasuke-kun!
What are you waiting for?
Bring me a stamp.
I don't want to.
What's your answer?
You don't care what happens to this child?
I don't care what happens
to this straw.
What?
What do you mean?
Well, I think I'm back to Moegi.
Yeah, you're a real leader.
Leader, I respect you.
Well, I...
Ah, so this is a technique of body multiplication.
It's time for you to give up.
Brother Naruto!
Kanohamaru!
Why are you so late?
Kanohamaru-chan!
It was so scary!
It's all good now, leader.
Well, did you manage to catch it?
Well, kind of.
This is a technique of body multiplication.
I see.
If you don't want the same thing
to happen to you,
don't pass the exam.
Sasuke-kun!
Die!
You were waiting for me to say that, weren't you?
Well, you're wrong.
I noticed your technique of creating a ghost
from the very beginning.
What?
You see, real Sasuke
would never invite me for a walk.
It's a shame, isn't it?
I haven't used such dilettante techniques for a long time.
Dilettante, you say?
That's right.
By the way,
the fact that you are a mirage yourself
and that you are no longer here
also catches my eye.
Well, what can I say?
Not bad.
I can see a student like Kase right away.
However, on the exam of natunin,
all this will become a reality.
Let's see who is who.
Hey, class leader,
I take the challenge and endure the exam.
Is the exam of natunin?
And still,
there is no confidence in myself.
Dull techniques.
Well, how did it go?
As a result of a special preliminary exam,
all nine people passed it.
As you all said,
the abilities of the students
have really increased.
But the truth is that the real exam of natunin
is not limited only to this.
Hey, did you hear?
On the exam of natunin,
the beginners have not taken part for five years.
Well,
they probably decided to compete with each other.
No,
there are rumors that three of them
are from the Kase detachment.
Yes, this is interesting.
Well,
I don't think so.
No matter how sad it is.
Sakura-chan,
why are you late?
I'm sorry.
Good morning, Sasuke-kun.
Hi.
What are you doing here?
Well,
Sasuke-kun.
Hi.
Something is wrong with her.
Are you going to pass the exam?
Maybe we shouldn't try, guys?
Well, of course,
there are greenhouses and minors.
I beg you,
let us through, please.
It's terrible.
Are you surprised?
Listen here,
we are still gentle.
The natunin exam is a serious obstacle.
How many times have we seen people
who, having passed this exam,
left the path of the shinobi
and thus lost the opportunity to return?
Besides, do you understand
what natunin is?
This is the level of the leader of the detachment,
and the responsibility for the failure
and the death of subordinates and the like.
And what's wrong with
pushing people who, well,
don't pass this exam?
Yes, convincing arguments,
but I'll still pass.
And also, put this barrier away
so that you create an illusion-making technique.
I have things to do on the third floor.
What is he talking about?
Well, I don't know.
Oh, you noticed, then.
Sakura, well,
you should be the best at noticing this.
In our detachment,
the ability to analyze know-how
in the technique of creating mirages
is the most developed among you.
Sasuke-kun.
Thank you.
Of course.
It's very noticeable.
Especially since it's actually the second floor.
And you guys are not a failure.
But you just guessed.
Isn't that right?
He's fast.
He was just beaten up,
and now he's changed.
He's my kick.
What kind of chakra is in his hand?
We agreed
to behave awkwardly,
not to attract attention to you.
Those were your words.
But...
I told you.
What do you mean?
His traces disappear after the blows.
Fake, huh?
My name is Rock Lee.
You're Sakura, aren't you?
Let's meet.
I'll protect you until you die.
You'd better get out of here.
You're...
fluffy.
Hey, Tam!
What's your name?
Damn!
What again?
They always address me as Sasuke!
Before you ask anyone's name,
you should call yourself.
You're a newbie, aren't you?
How old are you?
I don't have to answer.
What?
You're so cute.
So, you're fluffy.
Everyone ignores me.
Sasuke!
Naruto!
Let's go!
Are these kids
going to school?
Well, first of all,
we need to make a statement.
Looks like this year
the students are looking forward
to the exams.
And we, the examiners, too.
Well, well.
Some mirages and illusions
are waiting for this exam.
The sun is too shaken
Like I was turned
Sneaking out the classroom
By the back door
Am I right? Let me try some
But I didn't care
Waiting is wasting
For people like me
Don't cry, that's all right
Don't cry, that's just all right
Don't cry, that's when it's over
Cause you were here
The same in the end
I swear
I love you
Don't try, that's all right
Don't cry, cause you're so right
Don't try, with facts or fears
Cause you were hate yourself
In the end
Don't try, that's all right
Don't cry, cause you're so right
To be continued...
To be continued...
