If you open it gently and pull it closer
It will reach you, it will reach you for sure
Ah
Take a breath, pull it closer
It will fall, run to you, but always go far away
Pick it up, grab it
If it's not a dream, it's meaningless
So, go far away
Ah
Wow! Look what that guy did with his hands!
That's great! I wish I could do that!
I dislocate every one of his joints softly in my arm
Then with my chakra I can control anything
With your chakra? Wow!
Ah
The more you struggle with the child house, the stronger the grip is
I don't know what you're carrying, but as long as I have a hold of you, it makes no difference
Your neck right now if I want to, and I will if you give up
You want to bet? Die?
You fool! You're the one who's going to die!
I think he broke his neck
What's the big deal?
What a fool!
He doesn't even resist
Oh well
Now it's my turn
Bye
This is just a doll
A real ninja hid and controlled it
He's a puppet
He controls it
With the chakra in his hand
I give up
I give up!
But if I break your bones, you'll be even more flexible
That was close
I almost stopped the fight
It's a good thing you didn't do it
Because his opponent doesn't want to continue, the winner is concluded
Two against one is a low belt! Is that thing as fair as Ashi-sensei?
It's not two against one, it's a puppet, not another ninja
Yeah, it's just the puppet master's technique, sir
He's controlling the puppet with his chakra
It's a ninja's tool, but it's a shuriken
Everyone here really knows their own power from the chakras
But I thought my abilities would give me an edge over the others
So much for that, I think
You'll see
Take this!
Here, eat this
I know why. I mean, even Sasuke can win.
And it's probably just because he's so great that he can always win.
Frankly, I don't even want to imagine what will happen to you if you compete.
I think it's better if you quit, don't you?
It's pointless. That won't work with me.
If I make it through that, I can make it in this too.
I won't quit. Not ever.
In fact, I can't quit.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Come on!
Now let's continue. It's time to make the fourth battle.
Well, there'll never have to be two weirdos in this contest.
This is not full of us.
Who would have thought?
Oh, hey! Give me one of those!
This isn't the best time for fun.
Haruno Sakura vs. Yamanaka Ino
I never thought I'd fight you.
Or at least I didn't think it would happen so soon.
But don't expect me to go easy on you.
Ino is one of the strongest girls in Shinobi.
So she has a good chance to win.
But will she be able to use all of her strength to fight Sakura?
Of all of them, she's the strongest.
She's the strongest.
I hope Ino will be okay.
Let's hope.
So, what's it gonna be, Ino?
Go, Sakura!
You can do it!
Don't lose!
Begin.
Oh, no! I just knew it!
Sakura is totally going to win this water battle!
What a freak!
What are you saying to me?
Are you blind or what?
She's gonna lose.
Who do you think you are?
That's it.
That's as good as girls can get at it.
What?
What?
What?
What?
What?
It's not because they're girls, Ino, that's true.
It's just that those two are easy to kill.
It doesn't matter if you're a man or a woman in battle.
Huh?
Uh...
Using kids?
Well, well, we're going to get you, now.
Uh...
Let's get these bad boys!
Oh, no!
Oh, no!
Okay, everyone.
Up here.
Oh, no!
Okay, enough of this.
Ahhhhh!
Eh?
What the fuck, 여겨ئ
4. How to Place Necessities
Name Noichi has a special role to play.
He must not only be able to wield ninjutsu,
but also a wide range of other healings and skills novice women need.
If you can't manage to manoeuvre into any territory
by adopting the customs of the delivery of the wind there,
but you'll never be able to succeed as a spy.
Anyway, today's class is flower arranging.
Now then, everyone, go into the fields
and gather distinctive flowers.
Yes, ma'am!
Ina!
Wait up!
Wow!
What a cool...
I'm just not very good at this.
What about you?
That's not good.
Consider a girl named after a cherry blossom.
It's simple.
I'll explain, all right?
The first thing is, find the main flower for your plant.
Then find other flowers that complement it.
See, flowers have to highlight each other's beauty.
There's really nothing to it for you.
You're just not very good at this.
For example, look.
You see those cosmos flowers over there?
Well, if they were the main flowers in their range,
then the thorough work flowers would fit for complementing it.
Cosmos flowers are also called autumn cherry blossoms,
and they're the pretty flowers in the fall.
Their name comes from the old word harmony.
They can work with all the other flowers.
And then the autumn flowers will go to perfect with any of those flowers.
So, tell me, do I look as pretty as cosmos flowers do?
Come on, am I cute?
Yeah.
She took you long enough to think.
Well, well.
You sure look like you have a lot of fun.
You're so smart.
You know, you're so good at helping yourself, Sakura.
So don't go strutting around with your hot stuff and that.
Ami!
Sorry.
That head of yours is so empty that I just took it by the face
and thought I'd better put flowers in it.
Ino!
It's aconite.
Shinobi flower.
I don't think it's really that poisonous,
but still, I'll recommend that you blow it out when you get a chance.
I forgot to say that you're ruseful, isn't it?
Ino is so cool, isn't she?
She knows so much.
She dresses so stylishly and she's so pretty.
She's so cute.
She's even good with her shoes, then.
And her suit is awesome, too.
And compared to that, I'm nothing.
Hey, what's wrong?
Ino, if you're a cosmos flower,
then am I just a throwaway?
Now, why would you say that?
Well, let's see.
Actually, I don't think you're a flower at all, Sakura.
You're still a bud waiting to bloom.
Yeah, you're right.
All right, listen to me, Ino.
I'm not going to fight you because of Sasuke.
What did you say?
I'm not the bad girl you used to be.
You're not even on my radar.
You're not Sasuke's type.
Ino!
Pig!
Sucker!
I'm not the bad girl you used to be.
You're not even on my radar.
You're not Sasuke's type.
Ino!
Pig!
Sakura, hold your tongue!
You have no idea what you're on the road to!
You're nothing!
I feel sorry for you!
Did you?
That's too much, Ino!
That's a lie, isn't it?
If she sure made it around,
she'd be lying at the feet of a sakura.
Yes, but there's more to it.
Sakura is the kind of person
who uses force to do her own power.
But she also doesn't like having people
to feel sorry for her punches.
So I'm a butt as a flap, huh?
Say, um, Ino...
Sorry, what?
Why did you give me this ribbon?
What's it supposed to mean?
Well, actually...
Let's just say that that would be a real shame
if you were nothing but a bud.
I mean, how sad if these flowers
don't ever bloom.
For all we know,
that little bud...
It might become a flower
even more beautiful than cosmos.
Hmm...
Thank you, Ino.
Thank you.
Hey!
Come on!
We gotta finish our assignment.
Oh, okay.
What's wrong, Sakura?
Um, I got some dirt in my eye while I fell.
You're so clumsy.
Ino...
All along I tried to live my life
by what you said to me so long ago.
I thought that if I tried hard enough,
I could do it.
I could become a beautiful flower
instead of a bud,
instead of a bud only blooming,
but never blooming.
So I set my sights on you
because I wanted to be like you from the start.
You set an example for me
that gave me a goal, a strive for.
And that's because that's what
I can do as far as I can.
And I'm here today.
But now I don't want you to go away.
It's time I surpass you.
But if I don't fix you very best,
there's no point.
...
What in the world is going on?
What do you mean?
Why are those two getting so caught up
just looking at each other?
Why are they getting so close?
He just can't see that he's just like the same way, the same way as Sasuke.
Well, you know, rivalry is a tricky thing, not that I'm, you know.
Oh, hi there.
Well, what else am I to say about my old, cursed enemy?
Yet another stupid, senseless, stupid image.
Banner!
Yet another stupid, senseless, stupid image.
Banner!
He'd be up when he acts like Charles.
Guess what?
I got the same team as Sasuke.
So why are you telling me this now?
I won't lose to you, not anymore, Taro.
Sounds like a good idea to me.
And no matter what happens, I won't lose to you either, Sakura, okay?
The ribbon!
I'm giving it back.
That's a gift, it's to hold your hair back.
Just that headband ribbon that goes on your forehead, right?
From here on, I no longer want to be your shadow, Ino.
From here on, I no longer want to be your shadow, Ino.
When this goes on my forehead, then that's when I become a...
I'll be a true shinobi.
That's a good plan.
Me too.
Until then.
I understand, Sakura.
Sakura.
This time it is right.
No holding back.
A fair fight.
And I'm trying to win.
To be continued...
To be continued...
To be continued...
Hey, can you hear me?
When did Sakura get this power?
This will be harder than I thought.
As I expected, she's an excellent fighter, but I won't lose.
I absolutely will not lose.
I can't believe we're evenly matched now.
I'm not who I used to be.
I'm better, stronger.
This blow will finish the fight.
Next time.
Ultimate Battle.
I will win this battle.
Even the last battle in my life.
