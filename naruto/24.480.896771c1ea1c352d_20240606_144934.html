We cry for no one, we cry for no one
For our present
The pain is unbearable, the heart is unbearable, the shadow is unbearable
We breathe, we run through the darkness
Fighting and loving will never end
The heart is unbearable
Ninja Academy
Sorry for being late.
The first exam on the selection of tunins.
I am your examiner, Morino Ibiki.
Hey you, from Otogakure.
Has anyone allowed you to show your teeth before the start of the exam?
Do you want me to disqualify you right away?
Excuse me, this is our first exam, so we are a little nervous.
We are not angry.
Perhaps this is the right time to say the following.
No competition and conflicts are allowed without the examiner's permission.
And even if this permission is received, actions that lead to the death of the opponent are prohibited.
The participant who does the actions that preclude my will will be immediately disqualified along with his team.
Is everyone clear?
It's too simple, huh?
This is your exam.
So, from this moment on, the first exam on the selection of tunins is declared open.
You declare your applications.
In exchange for them, you receive these plates with numbers and take places in accordance with the numbers.
After that, you will be given signs for the written exam.
Signs?
Plans?
Test!
On paper!
Disqualification without warning?
This is the difficulty of the first stage of the exam.
Everyone was disqualified.
What should I do?
I was scared, I was scared.
For Naruto, this is the worst exam.
Naruto-kun.
Hinata, is that you?
How are you here?
Good luck.
Both of us.
Yes?
I didn't notice her at all.
Her presence is too unnoticeable.
There are several important rules in the first exam.
Since you cannot ask any questions, listen carefully.
Carefully.
Rules?
You can't even ask questions.
So, the first rule.
Each of you is given 10 points from the very beginning.
There are only 10 questions in the written exam.
Each of you gets one point.
Next, in this exam, the points are taken away.
One point is taken away for each incorrectly answered question.
If you don't answer three questions, the number of your points will decrease.
If you don't answer 10 questions, the number of points will be zero.
The second rule.
The result will depend on the total number of points in the entire team.
Wait.
The total number of points in the entire team?
What does that mean?
Silence.
There is a strong reason for this.
Listen quietly.
Reason?
If it's clear, then I'll tell you about the next, most important rule.
If the observer notices any side of the attempt to deceive or act equal to them,
for each such action, the guard will be taken away by two points.
This means that there may be people who will be eliminated from the exam even before the results.
That is, in addition to the written questions, there are other things for which the points are taken away.
You should understand that those who do rude, deceitful actions themselves are gradually destroying themselves.
We will reprint everything.
You strive to become tunins.
If you consider yourself a Shinobi, then act like a worthy Shinobi.
Calm down.
So.
Yes.
Soyu.
Exactly.
Naruto, okay.
Sasuke, I can handle it.
Even if Naruto gets zero points, Sasuke and I will save the situation.
Also, if someone in the team gets only zero points,
then the whole team is considered to have failed the exam.
What?
What?
They are already thirsty for my blood.
Naruto-kun.
By the way, the last question will be answered in 45 minutes after the start of the exam.
The time of the exam is one hour.
Let's start!
So.
It looks like the situation is just awful.
Naruto, please.
Only not zero points.
Damn it.
Naruto.
It looks like he suddenly got scared.
Bad thing.
What am I?
I didn't get stuck in such a situation.
In this situation, you need to look at all the questions slowly,
and then apply the effort to the easiest of them.
That's all.
So.
The first question is.
Chinese text?
Well, someone will do it.
Okay, next.
So.
The second question.
Parable B on the drawing shows the trajectory of the farthest flight of the entire river on the enemy Shinobi-A,
located on a tree with a height of 7 meters.
According to the elliptical curve depicted in the drawing,
tell us about the distinctive features of this enemy ninja,
and also make assumptions about what his maximum range will be.
This task is immediately to provide uncertain conditions
and to apply the analysis of energy in dynamics.
Such a Naruto cannot be solved.
And not only him.
In addition to me, almost no one here can solve it.
Well, the task.
So.
The next one.
Everything is clear.
I can't answer any of the questions.
Well, the ellipse.
It can't be.
It can't be.
What to do?
What to do?
What to do?
Let's say.
Of all the teams, only 10 could pass the exam.
Then, in any case, you need to gain an impressive number of points.
What are you?
A system that is simply provoked by deception.
Neither Naruto nor Sasuke.
You can not resort to deception.
Everything is fine.
Naruto is not so stupid either.
And I understand everything.
Don't be nervous.
First calmly, calmly.
Nothing remains but to whine.
Still no.
No, no, no.
No, no, no, no.
After all, let's think.
This method is arranged in such a way that it itself pushes us into deception.
In that sheet he marks something, but ...
Looks like you noticed someone.
Two points are taken for each fraud, right?
Two points are taken.
But usually for this immediately driven away.
You should understand that those who do rude deception themselves gradually destroy themselves.
If you consider yourself a shinobi, then act like a worthy shinobi.
I see.
That means what?
This is not just a test to determine your knowledge.
His true goal is ...
This is also an exam to determine the ability to use the technique of masking and covering.
So, you say, a shinobi should see the depth of the depth?
That is, the true meaning of the word examiner is that ...
If you are going to cheat, then not rude deception, but as a worthy shinobi, so as not to be noticed.
If you think so, then this exclusive method of removing points means simply removing two points for each noticed deception.
In other words, the examiners are also checked here.
And then we can collect the correct answers, while not making a sacrifice for deception.
Well, now I understand everything.
Naruto, you are not stupid either.
This is a question of life and death.
Think, think!
Oh, it's cold.
If you think that the goal of this test is to check our ability to collect information,
then somewhere in this audience there must be someone who knows the answers to the questions.
There should definitely be.
Well, let's do it, Karasu.
Good dog, Akamaru.
Next, the fourth question.
What is the name of Akamaru?
Akamaru is the name of Akamaru.
What is the name of Akamaru?
Akamaru is the name of Akamaru.
Next, the fourth question.
Judging by the rhythm, the order of writing, the number of lines of writing...
I see.
Good dog, Akamaru.
Good dog, Akamaru.
Well, go ahead and tell me.
The eighth question, then.
The eighth question, then.
Li, when you get it, can you see?
Fix the bandage.
Time is running out.
Well, if it continues like this, then nothing will remain.
How to start cheating.
But if I am noticed, it will win in Sakura and Sasuke.
But if I get zero points, then they will not pass the exam with me.
I can show you my test.
Do you want to?
What is she saying?
Hinata, why did she decide to do that?
Maybe this is some kind of trick?
Although Hinata is not capable of such actions.
Perhaps she is just trying to persuade me by the instructions of others.
Hinata, I want to ask you something.
Why do you want to wait for me to finish?
Well, I...
I...
I just...
I don't want us to break up on this.
That's why.
And we, newcomers, are only nine people.
And there are still so many difficulties ahead.
That's what it's about.
And then I started to suspect you in the wrong.
What a crazy luck!
It's great that Hinata turned out to be my neighbor.
What's going on?
I was just about to bow.
What the hell?
Five hits and you're disqualified.
How's that?
Two of you, come out of the auditorium with him.
Right now.
Number 23 is disqualified.
Number 43 and number 27 are disqualified.
No!
If there's any evidence that I'm a fraud,
can you keep an eye on me when there are so few of you?
I'm not a fraud.
I'm not a fraud.
Can you keep an eye on me when there are so few of you?
Listen, we, the elite, are selected from the number of tunas
specifically for this exam.
We don't ignore every blink of your eye.
And the evidence...
The evidence is this power.
Naruto-kun.
Hurry up.
Look.
Hinata.
You don't understand.
Ninjas like me are never dishonest.
Naruto-kun, but...
Besides, if they find out that you helped me with the fraud,
you might get into trouble.
Naruto-kun.
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have done that, right?
Come on.
It's all right.
What am I so stubborn?
What should I do now?
I'm a cool moron.
Serengan.
I'll copy all the movements of this guy.
My hand moves without stopping.
I hit this guy on time.
Looks like Sakura is over.
I didn't appreciate the quality of your decorations and your exclusive mind.
So be grateful to me for becoming the goal of such a wonderful technique.
The technique of replacing the body with the spirit.
Ino seems to have finally taken advantage of her technique.
Yes, it is impossible to resist her technique.
Sakura, I will not go into your mind for a long time with your permission.
We will write the answers as soon as possible.
They will definitely be transferred to Shikamaru and Tioji.
Number 59, disqualified.
Number 33, number 9.
This is the 13th disqualified team.
Number 41, disqualified.
Number 35, number 62, disqualified.
It can't be!
That boy doesn't even move his eyebrows in such a noisy environment.
He's cold-blooded, but he can take it.
It's just great for a newcomer.
The third eye, united with the visual nerves.
The third eye, close your eyes!
Oh, I got something in my eye.
Damn it!
Excuse me.
What do you need?
I need to go to the bathroom.
According to the rules, you can only go to the bathroom under our supervision.
I see.
And even though they are not so cool examiners,
they didn't even notice that there was more than one examiner.
Don't you think so?
Karasu!
40 minutes have already passed since the beginning of the exam.
Only 20 minutes left.
Soon they will ask the last question.
What should happen in 45 minutes after the start?
All that remains is to hope for it.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
I got it!
Stop!
Karasu!
Oh, no!
Karasu!
Karasu!
Oh, no!
Oh, no!
Karasu!
Oh, no!
Karasu!
Karasu!
Karasu!
Disqualified?
The rule of despair of the tenth round!
It's impossible to choose one of them!
Seriously, seriously!
That's not good!
Next episode!
A battle of the brave!
The tenth round of the hard one!
