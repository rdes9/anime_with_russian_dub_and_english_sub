Breakfast time!
Shadow Cloning Technique!
Banzai!
Naruto
You're not trying hard enough.
Try some more.
We need more fish.
What?
I could eat them all myself.
Well, if you think it's a weird one,
give it a try yourself!
Sasuke!
I've got enough firewood.
We need to set them on fire.
I've got to do everything I can.
What?
What are you doing?
The scroll!
No peeking!
It's already been four days since the second exam.
That's right.
Four days.
We're sure to get ready for the records,
and we only have 24 hours left.
I wonder if the other teams have already
got their scrolls and finished.
I wonder when they're going to be done
before I can eat a whale!
If we don't get away soon,
we're finished.
Almost ready!
I move fast and I can catch the biggest thing
in the world!
What are we doing?
There's probably no other teams left in the forest.
What do we do?
You're right.
The other teams must have been finished by now.
Yeah, it's been four days.
Anyway, we've been going so dark.
No need to do ourselves.
I'll go and try to find something to eat.
You guys rest.
Hey.
Yeah?
I remember right.
I think the other scrolls look like that one,
but it had a symbol of the sky,
and it was different in color.
It had white around the edges, right?
I guess so.
I wasn't really paying attention
when they showed them to us.
Anyway, why?
What's the big deal all of a sudden?
Whoa!
You're not really...
We have to leave it.
There may be more scrolls left.
Well, that's a cheerful thought.
Maybe so.
It's true.
Look, it's been 45 days
since the work that we've been out here.
That means we've already used up
80% of the time we've got to complete the exam.
Only 13 teams we have.
And there are only 16 parents
of heaven and earth schools.
And there are only 16 or 17 candidates
out looking for it.
Huh?
And if those all weren't passed,
it would be worse.
Don't forget, Sasuke,
that Artemar was burnt to hell
by our sky scroll.
Yeah, I remember.
The number of those three candidates
schools could be found
was reduced by one we're there.
Not to mention all the ones
that were found in the sky
by other teams, too.
Maybe we gave ourselves so much time
to use up from our last two nights
and our last two days healing our wounds.
If we want to pass the exam,
we've got to get serious now.
And we've got no choice.
The next enemy we face
will be our last chance.
I'm gonna get some water.
Hey, Sakura!
I know how you feel
if you don't have anybody else.
Look!
Look at what?
What do you mean look at what?
Oh, I've got some
lights in my room.
I've got tons of them!
You know, videos of ninjutsu and stuff like that.
We could change one of these to look exactly like heaven's scroll.
Stop! Don't even!
Even if you don't read the outside, have your favorite ninjutsu.
You couldn't know it without reading it fast against the rules, idiot!
I've got it all, if you know.
I think these things have a secret code in the middle, and then says it's all in the middle, together.
Yeah!
And that's where we get the password for the end of the exam.
Get it?
All I get is that you're using the wrong code.
We don't even know the secret code!
How in the world did they come up with it?
Ugh...
Ugh...
The next learning opportunity you can get, how did he come up with his own plan?
We gotta know the scroll rules.
But wait, we do have a way to find out the secret code.
The earth's scroll.
You wouldn't.
It's our only chance.
I'm gonna open and read this scroll.
No!
Norris, did you forget the rules?
No one can read the scrolls within the central tower.
I know!
But this is our only chance!
Uh-huh.
Careful!
It might be a trap.
Yeah, I found that.
Hey, what's wrong?
Guys?
Hey, what's this going down?
Uh...
What's going down?
Uh...
Uh...
Uh...
Uh...
Uh...
Uh...
Uh...
What happened?
What did you guys do?
I wouldn't do that.
An enemy.
Hey, what's going on?
What's going on?
What's going on?
What's going on?
What's going on?
What's going on?
Hey.
I can't believe you guys!
If I had freuen in my head...
Sorry exhaust governor.
Um, sorry.
There have been others everything these scrolls.
I see that.
I tight them by a powerful hypnotist.
So, a kind of kidd definitely or anyone in mind
they are attracted to read them it.
He'll not lose the Police before
We've been here in the forest until the very end of the exam.
Your name is Kabuto, right? We've met at the registration.
What are you doing here alone?
Don't worry that I'm following your scroll.
I guess not.
I suppose if you were, you would've just swiped it from Naruto.
You need a heaven scroll too.
So you're looking for a heaven scroll too, huh, Nadri?
You see, I already have them both.
It's a long story.
I had a lot of luck.
I was just on my way to the town to meet with my teammates to show up.
So, if you would excuse me...
Hold it.
I'll fight you.
What a lucky bunch.
You'll fight me for it?
But Sasuke...
Hold on a second, is this a joke or what?
Are you serious?
Perfectly.
Sorry, but I had no time to play nice.
Back off, Sasuke!
Kabuto just saved us from hypnotic sleep!
Naruto's got a point. I don't see him great for anything.
I don't care.
But Sasuke...
It can't be helped.
I don't think we have a choice.
Don't you get it?
Either he, or we.
Otherwise we won't pass the test.
You're lying.
What?
Come on.
You say it very confidently, but you don't really think so.
If it was true for you when you were going to finish the exam,
why overachieve to fight?
Why announce it from behind my back?
Why not just jump me with that?
That's what a ninja would do.
That's pretty deep.
It's okay.
I just think I admire you for it.
So here's what you should do.
I'll show you the path you should follow.
But let's go.
The smoke from the bonfire and the smell of the fried fish
must have attracted the unannounced guests.
And not only the wild animals, but the competition too.
You think there's still a lot of enemies out here?
Oh, yeah.
Just think about it.
What do you think?
What strategy should we find in the jungle?
To go search for the flowers in this huge forest?
Uh, no.
No.
You wait for the opponents to get the flowers
and bring them to the central tower, right?
So I don't have any chance of getting them
until I'm calling with the team
and marching on the tower with the escort.
Oh, yeah.
You get it.
You set up a trap,
and we get out of the ambush on the team
that will have both scrolls in their hands.
Right?
That's why you fall apart.
Huh?
Don't forget that other teams
can use the same strategy.
Waiting in ambush, you can get into the trap yourself.
So what?
There are traps everywhere,
and all the participants are in the ambush.
I don't like it when everyone's against me.
Yeah.
I'm going to throw them all out
and get the flowers from the sky.
And that's it.
We're going to pass the exam.
That's two and a half.
Well, at least there's something left.
What else?
Well, these exams always attract collectors.
Collectors?
Even when you're on a mission,
you can't lose your vigilance for a minute.
This kind of dangerous race
represents the so-called collectors.
Some of them get more scrolls than they need
for example, to drive their way out of their most powerful enemies.
Others collaborate with teams from their village,
helping each other with the necessary scrolls.
And some of them collect as many scrolls as they can
and destroy them for their own dark purposes.
They'll announce them to use against the stronger teams
as far as the line.
They'll be there all right.
Collectors are very powerful ninjas.
They're the biggest danger
the more likely you'll be on your way to the tower.
I see.
And I think I'm starting to understand
why you brought us along with you.
It's because you're afraid, aren't you?
You bet I am.
There's the tower.
And that's the end is in sight.
Now for the hardest part.
Good, about time to bring it on!
There's someone back there.
Ha!
Follow the line, it's just a big thing.
Just a thing.
Just a thing.
It's just a big thing.
Just a buzz.
Hey, Naruto.
Hmm?
Do us a favor.
Be careful and don't do a little roar, will you?
Hmm?
See, the whole idea is to let anyone know we're here.
If you go crashing in the first place,
we'll point you to a couple of flies.
We want them before they find us.
Oh, yeah.
I see your point.
Take it slow and quiet.
We've got all the time we've got left.
Okay.
All right.
Got it.
Hmm.
That's more like it.
Okay.
Okay.
A trap.
Yeah.
And it only works if you're on it.
Hey!
Kabuto!
Well, that was close.
A substitute to the jutsu.
Like I told you, it only gets worse when you're here on in.
I'm crawling out loud.
Sakura!
How far are we, boss?
Sakura!
How far are we, boss?
The tower's not getting any closer.
Now that you mention it, I was thinking that too.
It's weird.
Maybe not.
It would seem we were caught in a trap.
Somebody is playing games with us.
Look.
Ring a bell.
Huh?
What?
Oh, man!
No way!
It can't be!
Hey!
What's the big deal?
What's going on?
It can't be.
An illusion?
That's what it looks like.
And we were caught in that trap.
We were still in there, not being seen by someone.
And seeing the look in the round in circles.
What's their goal?
They're probably just trying to get us down.
It's a struggle.
We're frustrated and physically exhausted.
You mean like we're all right now?
Right.
We'll meet them face to face soon.
Naruto!
What did you say?
I'm fine with everything.
Everybody's against us.
What?
What?
What?
What?
What?
What?
What?
What?
What?
What?
What?
What?
What?
What?
What?
What?
What?
What?
What?
To be continued...
To be continued...
To be continued...
To be continued...
Look at all these guys!
Like a clone band!
Well, I got good news for them.
They're not the only ones with the cloning technique.
You want to see clones?
I'll show you clones.
We've been through so much for this show.
We're not going to give it to anyone.
Get real!
I don't care if there's 400 of them.
They're going to have to look for 400 hospital beds.
Believe it!
Next time, Clones Against Clones.
Mine's better!
Yeah!
