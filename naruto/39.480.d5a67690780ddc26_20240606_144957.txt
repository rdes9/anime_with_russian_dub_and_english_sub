Naruto
If you open it gently and take a breath
It will reach you, surely
It will reach you, surely
Ah
Take a breath, take a breath
Take a breath, take a breath
Take a breath, take a breath
It's useless if it's not a dream
That's why it's so far away
Waves of pain, it becomes sooner and sooner
Sasuke, I think you've got to stop
You're not your own after Aratimaru sent you down
And it's getting worse and worse
Yuroi Akado vs Sasuke Uchiha
I didn't think I'd go first
I couldn't ask for more
The first battle between Yuroi Akado and Sasuke Uchiha
Are there any objections?
None here
No
The pain won't go away
That cursed seal causes suffering
Don't use the serengan
I thought you didn't know
If that mark on the head is on the sword, your life will be in danger
I'm aware of it
Just in this moment I will stop the fight
Good luck
Stop the fight?
This thing seems to be responding to my chakra
I've got to fight him with the serengan
And even though he's still awake, he can't laugh himself to death
Sasuke, you won't like one of Yuroi's unique abilities
If you're ready, let's get started
What the...
You're swallowing my chakra
You just couldn't understand
Pushy Brawls
Lion's Barrage unleashed
Lion's Barrage unleashed
You're swallowing my chakra
You just couldn't understand
You're finally caught on, huh?
That's right, Sasuke
Yuroi has the ability to steal the chakra
Yuroi has the ability to just put his hand on the opponent
And he feeds his physical and spiritual power with amazing efficiency
And once he has stolen all of your energy, Sasuke
You'll have no choice but to use the power of my chakra
Go on, let go of this wonderful forbidden power
Only in this way will you be able to survive
So, you're still got some strength, huh?
Impressive for a guinea pig
Well, it was close
Don't worry, man, it'll be over soon
What's the matter? Is that all you can do?
Don't have the speed to win the fight
And don't have a chance to close the fight
I need to go a little faster
The great Sasuke Utiha
Is that all you can do?
Come on, Sasuke
Hey, Sasuke!
Come on, man, open that!
Do you call yourself an Uchiha?
You're gonna let the guineas fall over you!
Come on, Sasuke, you gotta get out of here!
They're all...
That's it
I'll teach you to turn your head
I'll teach you to turn your head on me
Big mistake, after you lost
Is this a surprise attack?
Huh? Where'd he go?
Whoa!
That's my move
What the...
Okay, I admitted, I borrowed the previous technique from here on in
It's gonna be original now
The Dancing Shadow
Now take this
Ah!
Oh, not again!
It keeps getting stronger and stronger
Don't do it!
Stop!
Please!
Come on! Open that!
You call yourself an Uchiha?
Shut up, Uchiha, don't break me off
Is this it?
Is this it?
No!
I won't give up!
Go away!
The curse mark has decreased!
Here we go
Too...
simple
Not quite
Come here!
I'm not done yet!
Lion's Lair
Lion's Lair
Well, this one's a bit...
I'm not done yet!
I'm declared
As the winner of this preliminary round,
Sasuke Uchiha,
goes on to the next round
Great!
Not bad
Funny, he used Rock Lee's technique for the Lion's Lair
He used to copy it with the Serengan
when he fought Rock Lee
Sasuke!
Hey, Sasuke!
You won, but in such an ugly way!
But it was so ugly!
Idiot
Give me a break
Oh, well
Sasuke
I'm so glad
I can't wait until my turn
Rock Lee
If I hadn't seen you use the moves
when we went head to head
this would have turned out like a nightmare
Still, I don't think
I'm going to use it very often
Amazing
I was the only one who used this technique
against him
and he was able to learn it
Serengan!
So that's what's unique about you
Sasuke, it's incredible
You just keep getting stronger and stronger
and stronger
You make it most
Little by little
Impressive
But you can't expect a high-speed technique
to take more than just
takes more than just
it takes more than just
sweat, sweat
sweat, sweat
even so
I don't want a move of yours
He reminds me of you, Kakashi
When you were young
you were exactly the same
Last year
Netsuhyuga was our candidate
This year it's Sasuke
She has
I wonder if we can find out
which one's stronger
The kid is so powerful
to have always been
so powerful
to have always been able to think
For members of the Uchiha clan
there are no limitations
It's incredible
The seal almost completely
took over them
but he was able to take it
Oh no
Not again
Well, well
Well
Sasuke, it's a miracle
This could be enough for us
Man, I'm hungry
It was delicious
It wasn't anything special
Magnificent
Sasuke Uchiha
We'll do all we can
for you to recover as quickly as possible
It's not your case
I'll look after him
Okay, up you go
You're coming with me
We've got to seal that
seal that seal
Right now?
I want to see you get to your one-to-the-mine
No
We've got to take care of it
I'm afraid it'll be too late
It's too late
You've already got your own slack as it is
Come on, let's go
Sasuke
Hey, Sakura
Maybe it just crazy like
Did you see any weird marks
on Sasuke's neck during the fight?
You've got to promise me
that you won't forget
anything you've done
I promise
I promise
I promise
I promise
I promise
You've got to promise me
that you won't forget
anything you've done
Why?
There's no need to worry about it
and work together
It doesn't do us any good
What mark?
I didn't see
Oh, okay
Okay then
Let's move on to the second match
Opus 4
No. 4
No. 1
Abumizaka against Shino assurance
Which one his okie gets?
no
no
Very good. Now if you want to run, you can get out again.
That's that ninja from the village hidden in the sound,
who Sasuke broke his arms for.
You seem to be very proud of your arms,
aren't you?
I'm proud of my arms.
I'm proud of my arms.
I'm proud of my arms.
You're proud of your arms, aren't you?
Attached to them.
What? What are you doing?
How's he gonna fight without arms?
Do you think she'll be alright?
He's okay.
Don't you worry about him.
He's the only one I'm worried about.
If you're ready,
let's begin.
Zaku, how are you gonna fight?
If you fight me,
it is for your own good.
That's strong.
Well, what do you know?
I have a little movement to one arm.
One good arm will do enough to beat you.
You couldn't use them
to beat me, could you?
Yeah, well, I can do that, yeah.
Try it, man.
It's all the way.
Okay.
It'll be over quick.
You ready?
Curse healing!
Curse!
There.
When the curse starts acting again,
the curse will keep it back.
But remember, Sasuke,
this curse will only work if you are strong enough to believe it.
It derives its power from the strength of your will.
If that will ever work,
if you begin to doubt yourself,
the curse will be over with all its fury.
Amazing.
Too kind of you, are you.
My.
How you grew up.
To think that you began to struggle
to perform the curse in Jutsu.
You.
Long time no see, Kakashi.
Orochimaru.
Orochimaru.
Orochimaru.
Well, this is an unpleasant surprise.
What sick little snake pit you crawled out of, and why?
What do you want, Sasuke?
I don't care if you are the legendary Zonin.
I won't back down, Orochimaru.
You want him dead.
You want him dead.
You want him dead.
You want him dead.
You want him dead.
You want him dead.
I won't back down, Orochimaru.
You want him.
You'll have to kill me first.
Next time.
Kakashi and Orochimaru face to face.
I'm gonna stop you.
Here and now.
