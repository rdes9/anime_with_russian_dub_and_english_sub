NO BURGLAR
Naruto
I'm in a hurry, as if I'm being chased
My dry heart is borrowing
Not for anyone, not for anyone
Our present
Unleash the pain, unleash the heart, unleash the shadow
Take a breath, run through the darkness
Fighting and loving each other
The end is near
Listen, kid, do you want to take a picture in this form?
Take a picture, come on!
Okay, don't be offended later
Say cheese!
My name is Kanakamaru!
Cheese!
My name is Kanakamaru!
At first I couldn't figure out how to take a picture
It took me three hours just to figure it out
But then I finally figured it out
Something like a project art on my face
Only cooler
Take it again
No way!
We can't send this photo
Yeah, why don't you do it again?
Transformation!
Pretty good, Mr. Hokage
Did you think you'd mess it up?
Don't mess it up
That's the sexy Jitsu
Very true, too true
Don't do that again
And where is your bandage, Naruto?
You're supposed to be there
Oh, I'm not going to end up in your joint tutorial
I don't want to mess up
I don't want to mess up.
So, you've taken care of the band now, but your photo looks supposed to make you look like a clown.
It's supposed to just show your mission to the key ninja who will determine your future.
Look at the photo and tell who it is.
Well, fine. How am I supposed to know that it's going to be that hard?
Old man! I can't stand you anymore!
I'm going to beat you and become the fifth Hokage!
Ugh...
This is my grandson. Another problem.
I tripped over something!
Are you okay, honorable grandson?
By the way, there's nothing here for a trip or a sprain in that.
Who is this man over there?
It's that same boy!
Hmm, the nine-tailed fox. Of course, he's a kind of troublemaker.
All right, you're the one who tripped over my leg!
You tripped over a little thing too!
Hey, you! Take your hands off!
This is the honorable grandson of the honorable fifth Hokage!
That stuff will work on him, just like on the rest.
Now that he knows who I am, he won't dare to touch me!
What's the matter? You were going to hit me!
Are you afraid that the fifth Hokage is my grandson?
I don't care who your grandmother is!
Don't believe it!
This guy is different from everyone else!
This is ugly.
Listen carefully.
You are the honorable grandson of the honorable fifth Hokage.
You shouldn't let yourself be dragged into a fight.
Even if he deserves a beating!
You saw his photo.
You mustn't go down to his level.
Because you're an elite mentor.
I never make mistakes.
I'm always right!
I'm much better than other teachers.
So listen to my every word.
Your goal is to become a great teacher.
Your goal is to become the next Hokage.
I'll teach you how to do it.
Thanks to my high skill,
I'll bring you to the top.
But you must always be with me.
Do you understand me,
honorable grandson?
Where did he go?
I think he went after Naruto, but I don't know where.
What a horror after Naruto!
Honorable grandson!
How did he become like that?
My grandson is quite determined.
That was his 20th stint today.
And if he starts talking around with Naruto,
he'll surely gain more words.
Naruto will not teach him a good word, would he?
What's going on?
What's going on?
What's going on?
What's going on?
What's going on?
What's going on?
What's going on?
What's going on?
What's going on?
What's going on?
What's going on?
What's going on?
What's going on?
What's going on?
I can see that you're following me.
So just give it up.
That's so obvious, Senna.
So through my disguise, huh?
Rumors about you and your disguise.
Alright.
I'll be your friend and you'll be my trainer, okay?
And afterward, you're not doing that, you're not doing that, you're not doing that.
You're not doing that, you're not doing that.
You're not doing that, you're not doing that, you're not doing that, you're not doing that.
You're not doing that, you're not doing that, you're not doing that.
This is some kind of joke, isn't it?
No, I need a trainer.
Please, boss.
Boss?
Yeah, you're my boss.
Boss, boss, boss, boss.
Well, how can I leave you?
Listen, you wanna be a master ninja?
Then believe in yourself.
You gotta learn to control your cat.
Your cat, right?
Catra?
Catra?
I said catra.
Boss, I think you're talking about a catra.
Don't question it.
A real ninja is a catra.
Really? I didn't know that.
That's cool.
He believes everything I say.
Listen, honestly, what is a catra?
A catra is the elemental energy that is used for all the q-rams.
Ninja art is a combination of energy from each cell of the physical energy
that is intensified by training and experience.
When these two jump on the mat,
special hands are made,
but it is the focus of the combined energy for the hands to...
No, no, you're just reading that whole thing.
Yo, you can have all you want about getting into the technique,
but really it goes down to one thing.
What is it?
Just playing around with your gut.
Something? Okay, I'm with you.
All right, I'm going to throw some real good talent into you.
Are you ready?
I'm ready, boss!
Good, then let's do it.
Show me a transformation.
Believe it. Show me what you can do.
I'll take you to the next level.
I'm ready, but I'm going to be transformed.
There, you're ready to transform her.
No problem. Hang on, boss.
Transformation!
Well, do I look like her?
Uh, look close?
I look like her.
That looks like her.
That looks like her.
That looks like her.
That looks like her.
That looks like me.
Now, honorable grandson,
next time you transform me,
make me a little cuter.
Okay, time.
She's scary.
You did it.
You're the one that gets what you're under.
All right, next we'll do some research on female beauty.
Female beauty, right, boss?
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
This is not a library, Naruto.
Let's try it again.
Now, this is the last stop, so give it everything you've got, okay?
Everything!
I'm the boss!
Transform!
Hmm.
Naruto, it's you again!
It's not the one!
Why did you bring so much to me?
Sorry.
It's coming because I'm Hokage's grandson.
Hey, don't worry.
I prepared you, so now you're ready to learn sexy jutsu.
Believe it, you're just gonna need practice.
Practice?
All right, boss.
Now, the trick is that all the turns are in the right places.
You ready?
I'm ready, boss!
Transform!
What do you think?
No, don't!
She's got to be skinnier!
Skinnier!
What do you think, boss?
Hi.
How's that?
No, no, more graceful!
More graceful!
What do you think, boss?
Naruto, what has he done to the honorable grandson?
What's he thinking?
Where did they go?
I am a Jo-Nin, the highest ninja of the higher level
and a big trainer of the future Hokage.
And the scoundrel who took my student will be destroyed!
So, what's up with this dissection you've got with your grandfather?
My grandfather gave me the name Konohamaru
after the ancient name of the village.
So she's easy to remember.
But no one calls me that name now,
one person only.
Because when they look at me, they don't really see me.
All they see is the honorable grandson of Mr. Hokage.
No one knows who I am.
I can't stand anymore.
Like I'm invisible.
Like I don't exist.
I hate that.
That's the reason why I've got to become the Hokage now,
so people know who I am.
Get real.
You think people are gonna accept this sort of crap?
It's impossible to become a Hokage in one or two.
What?
It's not that simple.
You keep saying Hokage, Hokage.
You know how to become a real Hokage.
You know what you have to do?
What? What is it?
You're gonna have to defeat me in battle.
Mr. Hokage!
I've been looking for you.
For what purpose?
It's about the people.
Did he recently bring a new picture of your photo?
Hmm.
You know, I gave him a long lecture
because of a portion of noodles,
but he's still been because he became a genin,
that is, a ninja.
He thinks that will change things,
that people will stop looking down on him now.
People will stop looking down on him now.
I fear his dream will not come true.
People don't change that easily.
The nine tailed fox is inside of him.
Not everyone knows it, of course.
Only those who fought the beast 12 years ago know the truth.
I've ordered everyone to keep quiet about it.
Those who spoke excessively were severely punished.
That's why today's children don't know anything
about how the people are connected with the world.
That's why today's children don't know anything
about how the people are connected with the beast
that attacked our village and almost destroyed us all.
As long as the children don't know about it,
the people may hope that they'll be accepted.
That was the wish of the fourth Hokage.
Before he sacrificed himself for us,
he asked that the people, when he grew up,
be regarded as a hero.
A hero?
The fourth Hokage defeated the fox,
killing his spirit in a newborn baby,
who's just been cut off by a puppy.
By containing the fox in his tiny body,
Naruto saved the village.
That's why he's a hero.
Unfortunately, many people in the village don't understand this.
People are afraid of it.
Many are afraid that the fox will come out of Naruto's body.
Some think that he is a monster.
Their children feel that fear and hatred
when they turn away from Naruto.
You know what's said about these ancient things?
What's that, sir?
When the people who hate someone
because of what they have,
when they look at him,
their eyes become cold,
cold as a blizzard in the cold winter.
I found you!
The nine-tailed fox.
That icy look.
They all look at me that way.
So, honorable grandson,
time to go home.
No way!
I want to beat my grandfather
and win the title of Hokage!
Don't stand in my way!
A Hokage is more than just a warrior.
He must know what is good,
honesty, wisdom,
and honor.
And he must own thousands of Jutsu.
Transform!
Hi there.
Like my Jutsu?
Hey, he's not in a knockout.
What kind of primitive technique is that?
Such tasteless vulgarity
can't even work on me.
I'm much higher.
Honorable grandson,
stop this right now!
Naruto is turning you into a criminal.
Only my unique training
will speed up your way to the Hokage title.
Just leave me alone!
Jutsu double!
Unbelievable!
I'm not missed.
I'm Jyunin,
an elite ninja warrior.
I'm not as weak as
Mizuki.
You'll see how a real ninja
wins the obstacle.
Come on, boss!
Ready!
Transform!
Transform!
Transform!
Transform!
Master Ibisu!
Master Ibisu!
Got you!
With my hair and Jutsu!
He's combined shadow and
shadow double
with his own invention,
Jutsu sex.
What a stupid fighting technique.
I guess I wouldn't be able to do it either.
Oh, my God!
I can't beat my trainer again!
I want to be Hokage soon,
but I can't do it!
Why can't you do it?
You really think it's that easy?
To be Hokage,
you have to surpass all ninjas,
you have to prove yourself,
or everyone will believe in you.
Look at me!
I've been through a lot,
and ignored,
pushed away,
and played like a plague or something.
And after all that,
I found one person who believes in me.
To find that one person,
I had to knock down a lot.
So you better make sure that you're ready.
For what?
For lots of sweat and tears
while you're learning to be a ninja.
By the way,
there is always a way to come off Hokage.
Believe it.
If you really want to be a Hokage,
you're gonna have to beat me in battle.
Ha!
Who do you think you are,
and you think you can get away with it?
That's it.
I'm not gonna be your friend anymore.
From now on,
we're rivals.
I'm not gonna be your trainer anymore,
because tomorrow I start my ninja training.
But I accept your challenge,
and someday we'll fight for the title of the sixth Hokage.
So let's wait for that day.
Konohamaru!
At last,
he has entered the right path
and becomes a real ninja.
Konohamaru!
Konohamaru!
I'm sorry, I can't take it anymore.
What do I have to be in this...
Sakura keeps calling his name!
Sasuke, Sasuke!
She won't even look at me!
Okay, I know!
I'm a ninja!
I'm a ninja!
I'm a ninja!
I'm a ninja!
I'm a ninja!
I'm a ninja!
I'm a ninja!
I'm a ninja!
Okay, I know. I'll play a trick on him, and I'll leave him in the basket.
Sasuke, let's see how cool Sakura is after that.
Next time on Sasuke and Sakura, Friends or Enemies?
