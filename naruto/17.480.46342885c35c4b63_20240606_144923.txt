Water
Naruto
We cry for no one, we cry for no one
Our present is
Pain, hold on key, heart, hold on key
Shadow, hold on key
Hold your breath and run through the darkness
Fighting and loving each other
The end is white
The End
This is the first time your friend has died.
This is the path of the Shinobi.
I won't forgive you!
The End
I'll finish you right now!
The End
White past, sacred thoughts!
What a thirst for death!
This is not the child that came back a moment ago!
Don't come any closer!
What?
He took the needle by the flow of the chakra!
If so...
What if so?
What the hell?
What's going on?
Is the seal of Naruto destroyed?
No, it feels like the seal has weakened
and brought out the nine-tailed chakra.
Thank God!
It's not completely destroyed yet.
There's still time!
Do you hear me, Zabuza?
We both have things to do.
Maybe it doesn't fit your style,
but I think it's time to slowly end the fun.
Let's find out who's right and who's wrong.
Interesting.
What can you do in such a situation?
Kakashi, show me.
No!
I can't!
I can't crush this...
No!
Zabuza-san...
I can't compare to this guy.
Zabuza-san...
I...
You!
It's you then!
Why did you stop?
Your closest friend was killed by my hand,
and you can't kill me?
Why?
I can't kill you.
I can't kill you.
I can't kill you.
I can't kill you.
Zabuza-san...
Damn!
You did it yourself!
You can't kill me with such power.
Maybe he wasn't dear to you?
Do you have a dear person to you?
I want to protect my dear person and help his dreams come true.
This is my dream.
People often make mistakes,
and out of pity, without killing a person who needed to be killed.
People who leave such a person free do not cause me a drop of compassion or mercy.
Do you know?
This torment is called just to exist, to live, without having dreams, when you don't need anyone.
What do you want to say?
What do you want to say?
To Zabuza-san, a weak synod is useless.
You have deprived me of the meaning of life.
Why? Why? For someone like him?
Don't you understand that he is taking money from the scoundrels to carry out their evil deeds?
Is the only dear person to you that shameless scoundrel?
I had dear people a long time ago.
And my parents.
I was born in a small village with deep snow, which is in the country of water.
My parents lived a poor life, doing only agriculture.
But this was enough for them to be happy.
And I was happy.
I had very kind parents.
But when I reached my conscious age, something happened.
Something? What?
It's blood.
Blood?
Tell me what happened!
My father killed my mother.
And he was going to kill me.
In the country of water, in which there is a line that stops between individual wars,
people who had hereditary abilities...
Hereditary abilities?
These are special techniques or abilities that are passed on within the family from parents to children,
and even from grandfathers to grandchildren.
Because of these abilities, they were used in various conflicts,
as a result of which they began to be afraid,
as they brought many misfortunes and troubles to the country.
After the war, these families lived, hiding their power.
If their secrets were revealed, they would inevitably die.
I'm afraid that this guy has also experienced similar difficulties.
To such an extent, people with special abilities are afraid of others.
My mother had such abilities.
She lived with her father, hiding them.
And most likely she thought that for some time...
No, she will always be able to live happily in this way.
Wow! Mom, look!
Look, look! Isn't it great?
Why?
Why am I going to you?
It hurts! It hurts!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
However, our secret with mom became known to my father.
Mom!
Mom!
When I came to my senses, I saw what my father had done.
And at that moment I thought,
No, I had to think that this is the most painful thing in the world.
And the most terrible thing.
The most painful thing?
When everyone around thinks that you are not needed in this world.
Me too.
What about me?
You told me too, didn't you?
That you will become the greatest ninja in the village.
And everyone will recognize you.
If there is a person who will appreciate you with all their heart.
He will have to become the most precious person for you.
Zabuza-san, knowing that I had the ability of a detective.
He picked me up.
Despite what he knew.
These abilities were not needed by anyone.
Everyone was hated.
And he needed them.
Children like you die without being needed by anyone.
And you have the same eyes as I do.
Me too.
Kid, do you want to be needed by someone?
Will you be able to give everything for me?
Today, your abilities are mine.
Come with me.
I was so happy.
Haku, I'm sorry.
Tonight I leave the country of water.
But I will definitely come back.
I will seize this country in my own hands.
I don't need any support or encouragement for this.
No other useless words.
What I need.
I know.
Please don't worry.
I am Zabuza-san's weapon.
I will do everything you say.
Take me with you.
Just like a tool.
Good kid.
Forgive me, Zabuza-san.
I couldn't become your weapon.
Naruto-kun.
Please.
Kill me.
Ninpaku-tyosu.
An element of the earth of the technique of the pursuer.
No matter what you do, it won't work.
You don't know anything about me.
However, I know everything about you like my five fingers.
Kakashi.
You are completely in the hands of my Zyutsu.
What's that sound?
What? What's going on there?
If you can't see with your eyes, you can't hear with your ears,
then use your nose to track the target.
You have to do this because you can't see with your eyes in the fog.
This is my personal technique for tracking the enemy.
That's why I allowed you to wound me twice to the blood when you attacked.
Your weapon is great.
It swelled my blood.
It swelled my blood.
These are my cute dog Xenobis.
They smell better than other dogs.
So you are completely in the hands of my Zyutsu.
The fog is already spreading.
Your future is death.
Enough blabbering.
Don't pretend to be cool.
You can't do anything in this situation.
Your death is inevitable.
Zabuza, you've gone too far in your pranks.
Your ambitions were too great.
Your fiasco in the murder of Mizukage
after the coup d'etat.
You got to the bottom together with Shaika
from several subordinates.
You became a ninja fugitive.
Your name quickly became known in the village of Konoha.
You took money for ransom.
Then, in order to avoid the search for ninja fugitives
and the ransom itself.
Isn't that why you stood up for the victims,
like Gatou?
Zabuza, do you think I lived all this time
only because of my Serengan?
This time I will show you my own technique,
not copied.
Raikiri!
What kind of chakra is that in your hand?
I can see your eye.
You are too dangerous.
The Tenzunasan you were going to kill
is the pride of this country.
And the bridge they want to build
is the hope of the country.
Your ambitions require too many human sacrifices.
And that's not what you should do, Senobi.
What does it matter to me?
I fought for my own ideals.
They will never change.
I'll say it again.
Give up.
Your future is death.
Please kill me.
Why are you hesitating?
Listen!
What kind of stupid talk is that?
Weapons, tools!
And you call that an expensive man to you?
Do you really like that?
Can't you do that?
And what's wrong with it?
What's wrong with it?
But...
Zabuza-san gave hope
even to someone like me.
He needed me.
But now I've lost what I was meant to be.
Now I won't need Zabuza-san anymore.
That's why I'm asking you
to help me.
Please.
Please.
Please.
Please.
Please.
That's why I'm asking you.
Come on.
Hurry up.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Are you okay with that? Are you really okay with that?
I can't accept it! I absolutely can't accept it!
Next time, on a tool called Shinobi
