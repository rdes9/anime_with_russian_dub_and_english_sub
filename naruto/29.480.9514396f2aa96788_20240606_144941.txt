Naruto
Gently, open your eyes and hold me close
I'll reach you, I'm sure, I'll reach you, Motso-san
Ah
I'll hold you close, I'll hold you close
I'll run towards you, I'll run to you, I'll run to you
I'll seize you, I'll seize you
If it's not a dream, there's no point
That's why it's a distant land
All right then, what do we do?
We need a password
What kind of password?
Okay, I won't say it closely, because I only want to say it once
The question will be, what is a ninja strike?
The response is, a ninja waits until the time is right
When the enemy sleeps and drops his guard
When his weapon is dead, the two ninja strikes
That is a moment for a ninja strike
Got it?
I can't move!
You'd love to get your hands on our escrow, wouldn't you?
Well, when this is all over
One of us will have both straws
And the other will be dead
I can't!
Is there no way I'm going to die right now?
No way!
I can't just leave you up in the air like that!
I've got to get out of here alive!
No, I can't just leave you up in the air like that!
I've got to get out of here alive or dead!
Shadow cloning technique!
It's no use
I can't move
I expected you to be more of a challenge
How disappointing
Move, Sasuke!
Move!
He overcame the provoking fear with his conscious pain
So, this frame is not so counterproductive after all
I can't move
No!
Stay away!
I sense your fear and desperation
I love it when the victim continues to fight even while in the trap
And here comes the predator
Sorry, Sasuke!
Naruto!
Oh, and by the way
What was the password again?
Naruto, you're ahead
Never give up
Okay, so anyway
What is the password again?
Forget it, I know you didn't make it
Naruto!
Get out of here!
What do you think?
You don't know what you're going to get
Hurry!
For now!
While you still can!
So, Naruto, you managed to escape from my friend
Well done
Hmm, I get it
So that doesn't look like any old ranger
He's actually a snake
It was him who sent her
That demon
He doesn't get it
What is he dealing with?
What do I do?
Okay, I don't know what's going on here
But you're offending my friends
And I don't like that
So you just better start working with me
Naruto Uzumaki
No, he's just going to get all three of us killed
I've got to do something
But what?
Sasuke
Hmm
It's not
There's only one way
You can have it
You need the scroll
All right then
Take it and leave
Sasuke, what the hell are you doing?
How can you just give up so easily?
No way! What's wrong with you?
Shut the hell up
What?
Very wise, very simple
Sometimes a dead man's prey
And he can't see the long stands
He can't find the road
I hope this distracts the plotter
With something even more precious
Take it
Stop pulling the damn hero
You don't understand what's going on
You're going to kill us
Fast, you fool
You don't know what you're doing
Sister
You don't know what you're doing
Take it
You may not know the password
But I am sure
You're not the real Sasuke
How do we know we say here?
What do you mean?
It's not the real Sasuke
What sort of nonsense is this?
It's me who's the real Sasuke
You're lying! You're a liar! You may look just like him, you may sound like him, but don't you hear what's going on?
I don't care at all! Tell me what the fuck you're going through! So what do you think he's getting us through when he's not going to become a coward?
You keep saying you don't understand what I do! You've choked, that's what it is!
Naruto's right.
It doesn't matter.
As far as this war goes, if they kill you, we take it.
Let's try it!
No! Naruto, no!
Sasuke, I'm going to deal with her myself!
Summoning Jutsu!
Naruto!
That is no way to do it.
What do you think?
Is he telling it to a ninja, isn't it?
Well, whatever it is, it's a problem.
Just when things were going so smoothly, what a drag.
Shit.
We've got to report it to the examiner.
Yes, sir.
Nothing makes delving down like a loose red bean soup.
Nice.
I'm going to grab a bite to eat and see how things are going in the tower.
Maybe a couple of guys will be finishing something.
I'm going over straight to greet them at the tower.
There! The perfect leaf village symbol.
Pardon, ma'am. We've got a problem.
What sort of problem?
Corpses have been found.
Come on, it was nice eating, wasn't it?
I think you've got to see that.
There's something that seems to have been used by a ninja.
A ninja?
I went through the walls.
They were identifications of a ninja from a grass village.
All of them were hidden in the grass.
They went through the Tsunin exam.
They weren't just killed.
All their faces...
They're gone.
Yeah.
There's nothing that seems to be like melted or something.
No doubt about it.
This is his jutsu.
Why is he here?
What's he doing with the Tsunin exams?
THE TUNIN EXAM
Okay, I need photos of what these girls used to look like.
Where are their IDs?
Here you go.
So this is the face he stole from her.
Had it already happened before?
I was. Just a time of my life.
What's the thing you were saying to her?
We've got a big problem.
Okay, get in the way.
Tell our department to send for what's happening here.
There are at least two groups of people from the forest of death.
I'm going there myself.
Everyone follow me.
Now go!
Right.
He's come.
He's here. He went into the grass village.
What a tasty little beer.
Careful, he likes to play with food.
Naruto!
Naruto!
Enough. Finish him off.
Naruto!
Eat this!
What the hell was that?
Naruto!
Okay, Naruto. He's gone mad.
I never would have thought that Naruto was that kind of powerful.
That fire in his eyes, that's not a mistake.
Is that really Naruto?
Things are taking an interesting turn.
Now then, let's see who's next.
Sasuke?
Sasuke!
This could be bad.
I've got a bad feeling.
I pray I'm not doing anything wrong.
Hey, kid.
You're not hurt, are you?
You scary cat.
Naruto.
Hey.
Yeah?
You're not hurt, are you?
Scary cat.
Sasuke!
Standing there frozen like a fucking rabbit!
No way! You're not the Sasuke I know!
Hey, you worm!
Let me go! Let me go!
Extraordinary.
So the night of the red-tailed fox survived.
I see.
When your anger is aroused,
some of the undead fox's chakra has released.
What an interesting childhood you must have had.
The smell that seals the innuendo has appeared on your skin.
Five probes sealed.
Sasuke!
Help! Do something!
For twelve years, the seal has remained broken.
Soon the demon's chakra, the nine-tailed fox, will be divided.
But now, he's just a mile away.
No way he'll survive at all!
Sasuke! What's wrong with you?
Sasuke!
Okay, you say people are clumsy, weird, and a little kid,
but he's not a coward, at least.
He's doing something!
He's no coward!
You're such a stupid brother of mine.
To kill me, you must hate me, despise me,
but if you're so clingy to your precious life,
you're a coward.
Run away and live.
Run away and live.
Live with a she.
No!
Hmm. It's time to relax.
Without the clan's blood, calm down.
That's more like it.
I think I'll play with him,
and learn what he's made of.
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No, no!
No, no!
No, no!
No!
No!
I can't!
No!
No!
Let go!
No!
Calm down!
Calm down!
