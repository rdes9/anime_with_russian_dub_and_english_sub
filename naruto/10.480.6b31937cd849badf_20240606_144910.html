        <pre>On Itself
Naruto
For the sake of no one, for the sake of no one
Our present is
Pain is a burden, heart is a burden, shadow is a burden
Take a breath and run through the darkness
Fighting and loving each other
The end is the command
The end is the command
Right
Look, Sensei is naked
That's what I'll tell you, Sensei
Serengan is, of course, strength
But if you put something like this on me, you'll hurt me
Sorry
You'll hurt me
Well, at least he did take care of such a weak ninja
Right, but that guy in the mask, what about him?
He's from the elite crowd, you know, the village from the mist
And that's a cool Shinobi
The others in the masks don't walk
What exactly are they?
They are Tsumo, the center of the destruction of mature operatives
They are also called Beise Detsu, the guards of the world
They bury them, you can't find them later
There's a lot of secrets in the Shinobi's body
Ninjutsu, Chakras, all sorts of special equipment
If they find out about them, it's a great danger
For instance, if I get killed, they'll have to handle my Serengan
They'll try to handle all of us, if they're not stupid
In the worst case, like that guy Chutsu, they take care of the bodies
so that nobody finds out
It's the secret duty of the Shinobi to do that
To keep the secrets
The Shinobi trades his body for Chakras until he's eliminated
They'll iterate every trace of his existence
That's their specialty
First, I'll cut you down into pieces for the rest of your life
That's enough for now, Chutsu
So, you've already done for life
Damn it, you're a real beast
You're the only one that can do what I was asked
If you keep pulling me out like that, then I will be finished
How long are you going to keep this stupid thing on your face?
Take it off
I have good memories of this thing
And it was quite useful for tricking that ninja
If I hadn't intervened, you'd have been finished
That would be certain
Putting me in a temporary test, that's fine
But not if my skull was split in half
I'm sick of your tricks
Cruel as you may be, I would enjoy it
It was the only thing I had
And I wasn't one of my friends
If you lost my business in the same way that I've done even more
The neck of your body
There's a layer of muscle
So if you straighten to the pressure points
There's no way you can train for a week
Although, if you're southern as usual
You'll probably be moving in half the time
You're so wicked
And cruel at the same time
Rare combination
That's why I keep you around
I'm still a kid when it comes to boys
The mess is clear
Next time, behave decently
Next time, I'll put this siren gun right in one place
The forest of chakras
What is this?
We were suffocating this Zabuza
And something's bugging me
It's like we've been bewitched again
Sensei, are you okay?
Are you still alive?
Yeah, so what was I talking about?
These oinins
They start to tickle the body right on the spot
So there's no hope for error
So what's the point?
Think about it
You remember what that tracker did to the guy's body?
We don't know what he did
I mean, he grabbed him, took him away somewhere
Exactly
But why?
He should have worked on something right in the head
Just like his body
Think about what he was doing
Take down
The era of the evil
Throwing needles
Now what?
Exactly
None of it answers
What are you going to ever remember?
You remember that sex?
Here's the truth
So what's the story?
He's alive
But we saw his body
I saw it myself
You could have sensed it
You just said there was no pulse
His heart stopped
But that was just an action for a mistake
It was a fake death
The weapon's tracker used all the same way
You can't kill or pierce them
You can't misbehave or move them
Not if you get to the sensitive point
The needles used for the action
by the acupuncture
Trackers are tired of anatomy
They can't even stop the heart
Because the heart is so temperate
While keeping the body alive
It doesn't matter for them
It hurts
He carries off his own body
If he wants to put his hair on his hands
If he wanted to kill him
Then why Sanborn?
But our rear
From these two
I mean that the tracker wasn't trying to
destroy Zabuzza
It was trying to save him
Come on, think less
Or your head's gonna explode
There's nothing to think about
You need to prepare to quit
Hesitant ninja rule number one
Learn while you're alive
If you have a suspicion
Ninja reacts quickly
Otherwise you're dead
Look, Zabuzza has no pulse
And he's happy
So, second shift
What are we gonna do?
You're not transportable
What do you have to do with me?
Hold on!
You want us to kill
Zabuzza alone?
You're a ninja with a beard
And you couldn't handle him
You want us all to go to hell
Yeah, all to hell
To hell
Here's the thing
Zabuzza helped him to go to hell
Right, you're gonna go to hell again
Naruto
What?
You don't want to?
He does seem strong
Or a little confident
But
So you know this, Kakashi-sensei?
Now things are gonna get bad
Leave it! I don't want anything to leave it, huh?
Who are you?
Inari, what are you doing here?
Welcome back, grandpa
Inari, that was very rude
These ninjas
They're gonna put you on them
It's okay
It's okay
Mom, don't you get it
They're gonna get them back
They're gonna make more holes
Honey, what are you talking about?
Have you ever heard about a super ninja?
I'm gonna be in front of you
I'm gonna be in front of you
I'm gonna be in front of you
I'm gonna be in front of you
I'm gonna be in front of you
There's no such thing as a hero
There's no such thing as a hero
There's no such stupid ideas
What did you say?
Naruto, don't
If you want to stay alive, get the hell out of here
Inari, wait
Are you offended?
No, I'm gonna be alone
I want to be alone
I want to be alone
Sorry, honey
What kind of a fool is that?
I'm gonna put him in his case right now
What kind of a fool is that?
I'm gonna put him in his case right now
He's crying?
No, daddy, no
I'm gonna put him in his case right now
What kind of a fool is that?
I'm gonna put him in his case right now
What kind of a fool is that?
I'm gonna put him in his case right now
All right, training's going on in column four
Right
First, the theme of today's lecture
is the chakra
or just basic sense of how a ninja's understanding
chakra is essential
We know that
That's right
All right, Naruto. I'll explain it to you as a view in a second.
Chakras are elements of life energy.
Ninjas are needed for jutsu, and generally for health.
Chakras have physical energy, which is located in all the cells of the entire body.
And, physical energy is a powerful source of power, which is intensified through training and training.
As you need to be two types of chakras, you need to draw on top of each other in order to perform jutsu.
This is called physical and spiritual power.
That's the key.
Finally, hand-drawing, focus on releasing chakras.
Right on all points.
Here's the girl, and the hand of Sensei did a good job.
I don't understand anything!
Can't you do it a little simpler?
The whole point is when the jutsu goes down.
You're right, Chef.
We're already in the chakras, and we're already in the hands.
No, not matter.
Well, I was trying to say that theory is theory.
What?
How did you get that?
Calm down, guys.
It's just like Sakura said.
Chakras are physical and spiritual.
They need to be aligned with each other.
But, how do you do that?
Each jutsu depends on the kind of chakras.
The chakras take place in different proportions.
So that thing can be mixed up exactly the right way.
Up to now, you've just casted a lot of chakras,
but you can't do that right.
Even if you produce a lot of chakras,
unless you can balance and control it,
it's all worthless.
The jutsu won't be able to do it on its own,
or it'll just be a jutsu.
You waste so much energy on it,
and you're about to jump,
and you can't fight at all.
So how do you do that?
So how do you say that?
Train so hard that you'll only get your second chance
to put your life on the line.
What do you have to do?
Climb a tree.
Climb a tree? Why?
But, there's just one rule.
No hands.
What? You're kidding?
Am I?
Let's see.
Ah!
He's climbing.
Straight, huh?
And he's only using his feet.
Well, you get it.
Focus the chakra to the soles of your feet.
Focus the chakra to the soles of your feet.
When the chakra is in place,
the feet will stick where they should.
Wait a minute.
That's beautiful.
But how do you fight zabuza?
That's the only way to fight it, sir.
And you can't learn anything from this training.
First, you have to be able to
blow the chakra out and focus it on one side.
This is difficult.
Not every experienced ninja can do it.
This is the point.
If you can't combine physical and spiritual chakra,
you can't do anything at all.
Especially if you have to
point it to the soles of your feet.
Are you getting the picture?
If you master this,
you'll be able to master
any zyutsu,
theoretically.
The second thing is
how to maintain your chakra levels.
When you do a sudden attack,
it's actually very difficult
to point it to the soles of your feet.
So you need to learn it
until you have a second nature.
Well, I can talk about this all day,
but there's a lot to see if you will it.
You need to apply
the chakra in your training.
Use the kunai,
mark the highest point
without missing your hands.
Then try to get back
to the highest point
even higher.
At first, you need to get
as high as possible
until you get it.
Ready?
Suya!
I'm more than ready!
This is going to be no slow away!
You said it yourself, Sensei!
I'm the one who's grown the most!
It's a fact!
Definitely, you can do it.
Focus and do it!
What did he say?
Focus?
I need to draw the chakra
to the bottom of my feet.
I've got it!
Charge!
Charge!
This is harder than I thought.
The balance is out of place.
If the chakra's in the foot,
it's the same as the tree.
But if it's not strong enough,
if you pull back down,
you're not doing it.
That's about right.
Hey, Naruto!
Hey!
Sakura!
That's it!
Girls always do better than boys.
Well done, Sakura!
Yeah! Well done, Sakura!
I knew you could do it!
Fact!
They take all kinds of commands.
Whatever.
I think we need to make it easier,
or they'll get mad.
Why is it always like that?
That's right, guys.
So who was going to become
the Hakage one day?
It looks like it's going to be Sakura.
And if it was quiet,
he'd still be doing it.
Maybe they're not so great after all.
Shut up!
If you talk to me like that,
Sasuke's going to hate me!
All right.
It looks like I've got them.
I'm going to use this Rex
to train them.
Once you train them,
they'll become a valuable asset.
Oh, wow!
I'm going to beat you first, Sasuke!
Then I'm going to beat all of them!
Fact!
What a waste of time.
They don't even know what they're up against.
Well, my dear,
are you back?
Did you get beat up by Zeus,
eh, soldier?
Well, I've found a job.
Do you all know
who hit you in Zutuman?
That's amazing.
Where does that useless IQ come from?
I'm going to beat you.
I'm going to beat you.
I'm going to beat you.
I'm going to beat you.
I'm going to beat you.
Drawing stories.
Hang on a minute.
All right.
Let's just have a service.
And don't play dumb
when you're being taught.
Keep your hands off of him.
You're going to break him!
That's impossible.
No one can move that thing.
Don't push me.
I'm not really fat enough.
One chance!
That's it!
You fail this time, but once you are,
then people will never come back for you.
Let's go.
I think
it's too much of a hack.
Perhaps, but it's too early
to take in contact.
We still have our best cover.
Think about it.
The murderers will draw our attention.
They're going to hunt us again.
We need to stay calm.
Right.
That's it.
No more.
That's it.
We just saw it with one eye.
Naruta,
Now he'll get up and throw the candy-bobber.
There he goes.
So predictable and fair-ass.
Hey, not good.
Talk to me about that.
But please, don't say a word.
Please, please.
He's getting better and better from now on.
He's getting stronger and stronger.
His chakra is like an elephant's.
Not like Sasuke's.
In fact, if you think about it,
it's probably even greater than mine.
Cultivate your hunger.
Before you idealize.
Motivate your anger.
To make them all realize.
Climbing the mountain.
Never coming down.
Breaking through the contents.
Never falling down.
But he is too shaken.
Like I was 12.
Sneaking out the classroom.
By the back door.
I'm all alone.
I'm all alone.
I'm all alone.
I'm all alone.
I'm all alone.
I'm all alone.
I'm all alone.
I'm all alone.
I'm all alone.
I'm all alone.
I'm all alone.
I'm all alone.
I'm all alone.
I'm all alone.
I'm all alone.
I'm all alone.
I'm all alone.
I'm all alone.
I'm all alone.
I'm all alone.
I'm all alone.
I'm all alone.
I'm all alone.
I'm all alone.
I'm all alone.
I'm all alone.
I'm all alone.
I'm all alone.
and let go of Nunu, and all the time alone, and what to grumble about?
What's all that crying for?
I mean, how can you sound all those snot?
And what made him so sad anyway?
Next time, the land where our children lived.
What would he get if he destroyed it?
Believe it!
