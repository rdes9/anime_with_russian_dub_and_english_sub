Naruto
Naruto
Sasuke!
You say that Naruto is clumsy, strange and unbearable little kid.
But at least he's not a coward!
He's doing something!
At least...
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
What a stupid brother I have.
To kill me, you must hate me.
You'll look down on me.
But if you're so fond of your precious life,
run away and live.
Live with the sheep.
No!
No!
The Shoving Dragon
The Shoving Dragon!
Dragon Flames Technique
Dragon Flames Technique
I knew when it's finally happened
is a chiap that has come to a boil.
I think I'll play with him a little and then we'll see what he's made of.
All I care about is the survival of my own skin.
But now I've got it all figured out.
I see the hero is not always the one to be careful.
Naruto! Sakura!
How am I going to stand up against my brother if I don't try to attack him?
I can see him!
I can see him!
Alright, it's over.
Just...
not necessary.
Alex!
Alex!
Alex!
Why would Mary repeat the same mistake?
Why repeat the same mistake?
Holdなん на на!
Wow ZOMBIE SPOILER
Your girl, you anticipate my plans and your aim is true.
You can see my hopes, can't you?
Something's going down.
I gotta find things sooner or later.
My odds are bad enough if it is.
It won't get worse in the dark.
But why now?
What the hell is he after?
Hmm.
No matter. He's here.
Time has finished this.
Ah!
Ah! Ah!
Ah!
It's a clone!
Ah!
Ah! Saskia!
What a disappointment you've been out to.
Your insults have been futile.
You cheat, and you think you're more of a child than you are.
I see a little worm.
Ah!
Ah!
Incredible!
Serengan mill!
Triple blade!
Fire element! Fire Dragon Technique!
Ah!
It worked!
Saskia!
You did it!
You okay?
Don't worry.
It's all over.
No! Impossible!
Such mastery over a Shattuck on its own power can teach you to watch out for your child.
You're not a child.
You're a child.
You're a child.
You're a child.
You're a child.
You're a child.
You're a child.
You're a child.
You're too much. After all, it's good that I found you.
Yes, he will do nicely.
You are definitely like your brother.
If anything in his eyes, you're even stronger than him.
Who are you? What do you want?
My name is Aratimar.
We can meet again if you want.
But you will have to pass the test with the best results.
This is a sign of the sky!
You have to defeat the ninja and the village hidden in the sound.
Do you think we'll want to meet after what you've done?
Never!
See you again.
Sasuke, no!
Sasuke!
What have you done to him?
Nothing, just a little gift.
So that he doesn't want to part with me.
He wants more chakra from me.
I admire his current abilities.
Sasuke!
What has he done to you?
It's okay.
Come on, you'll be okay.
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Naruto!
Sasuke is hurt!
I need help!
Naruto!
What?
What do I do now?
I can feel him.
I can feel him.
How are you, Kanko?
It's been a long time.
You're a criminal of class S, number one in the list of criminals.
I'll stop you even at the cost of my own life.
I'm the one to do it.
Because after all, you're the one who taught me everything.
You're the one who taught me everything.
Not quite.
Striking Shadowsnakes!
Come out of there!
I got you.
Now that's plenty to throw your left hand.
That hand sign.
Right.
It's both of you.
You're going to die here.
Ninja arts to make it as a waste to do.
You're afraid to be left alone.
That's right.
Striking Shadowsnakes!
Kanko, you're one of the best ninjas in the village.
How can you use the forbidden techniques I taught you?
It won't work against me.
Why are you here?
I'm disappointed.
It's been a friendly reception after all this time.
Don't tell me you've come here to assassinate one of Kage?
No, not yet.
I don't have enough ninjas for that.
But I first came to attract new ones to my side.
Oh, it's the mark I did.
I recently put the same one on one young man.
He's a very promising ninja.
You're the same guy.
He'll die very soon.
Maybe.
I'd say one out of ten it will work against him.
But the kid is in the way of your paths.
It sounds like he's what I'm badly in need of.
Oh, Jeff, is that it?
You can't still be angry that I abandoned you when I stopped needing you.
In some ways, the boy is a really talented one.
You see, in his veins the clan's blood flows quietly.
And he's in excellent form.
Yes, he will be the heir I'm looking for.
I wonder if he'll be able to keep his interest.
I just made sure no one stops the exams early.
Three of my followers are also wearing it.
I look forward to seeing how it will fare.
Bear this in mind.
If they deprive me of this little pleasure,
then the hidden village in the forest will cease to exist.
All right, that's enough resting out my here.
The other teams will be calling in soon.
And that means it's time to attack.
You know the plan is to split up and fan out.
Whatever happens, we can hope that we manage to get to that spot.
We meet up back here in this spot.
Got it?
No sweat.
Roger.
All right, then.
Let's move.
Roger.
At least it's finally breathing, you know.
It's still got a high fever.
Looks like it's up to me to take care of them.
I've wasted enough time.
Somebody's got to tell Lord Hukage about what happened.
Huh?
Hmm.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Hmm.
Ugh.
I don't have time for this.
Ugh.
Ugh.
Ugh.
Ugh.
It's a paralysis function.
So there you are, Anka.
So there you are, Anka.
Man, you are going to have to start dying again here, didn't you?
Well, there's no way to get snippy.
Ugh.
Ugh.
Ugh.
Ugh.
Anka, you all right?
What is it?
A mark.
That curse must appear.
But that means...
Orochi is long...
What?
Here?
No.
Let's get you up.
We'll carry you to Lord Hukage if we have to.
No.
No.
Take me to the tower.
What are you talking about?
You know we have to release the Lord at the first time, Orochi.
It's more important than your exams.
I know.
All right then.
Send the Lord Hukage to the tower.
I'll explain everything there.
The Lord Hukage
So there you are.
All right.
According to the order of the Oratimars, we will strike them at dawn.
Our target is Uchiha.
Sasuke Uchiha.
And if the others resist?
Kill them.
Sasuke Uchiha
Hey, can you hear me?
The sky is endlessly blue
The sea is endlessly silent
You always smile
Otherwise, you'll cry
Even if you don't look around, it's okay
Everyone is in this hand
I want to cry, I want to run away
I want to forget happiness
Light was born, darkness was born
Two are one, harmony is telepathy
Hey, can you hear me?
It is I, Rock Lee, Sensei from the village hidden in the forest.
Everything is going as I planned.
I will conquer the heart of the beautiful Sakura by saving her.
I will have a lot of enemies, but the better.
I will finally reveal my special gift.
Well, my special talent.
Right, Sensei?
Next time, I will save you from death.
I promise.
