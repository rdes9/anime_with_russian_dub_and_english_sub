Let's see!
I am Seo Nakamoto
Of a stage
I'm Oro ocup.
Are you生活ิ?
Are you a imager?
You brought up a album under a title.
If you can launcher the momentum of hatch escaped by selling audio cinematics to burn them down.
Gently, tightly, tightly, tightly, tightly, tightly
I'm sure I'll reach you, I'm sure I'll reach you
Ah
I'm close, I'm close, I'm close, I'm close
I'm sure I'll reach you, I'm sure I'll reach you
I'm sure I'll reach you, I'm sure I'll reach you
If it's not a dream, there's no meaning
Far away
Now that you mention it, I was thinking that too
It's weird
Maybe not
It would seem we've been spotted
Somebody's playing games with us
Look
Ring a bell?
Huh?
Oh man, we can't be
Hey, what's the big idea?
Let's go in there
Can't you see?
That's what it looks like
And we fell for it completely
We were so concerned with not being seen by anyone
We didn't see we were walking away, didn't see what's going on
What's their game?
They're probably trying to wear us down
And they start when we're frustrated and just get exhausted
You mean they are now?
Right
They'll be coming soon
Let's go
Well, Naruto
You wanted a fight?
I'm fine with it, it's the way I like it
Clone versus clone, mine is better than yours
What are they?
Clones from it
It's a whole lot of them
Like we're in a trap
Oh yeah, that's enough
Well, I thought they were serious
That's good, Naruto
No!
What was that?
What the hell?
What the hell?
What's really going on here?
Serengan
Naruto
Sasuke
Shovel!
Yeah!
Get down!
Saskia!
What's going on?
It can't-
I can't move.
It has reached all the way.
Are you alright?
It's a real clone, it's not an illusion anymore.
Surrender your scroll!
Surrender your scroll!
Surrender your scroll!
Surrender your scroll!
The fact that you've injured a lady means that she's a real shadow clone!
Surrender your scroll!
But how can that be?
Shadow clones disappear after any strike!
But that didn't happen!
So what the heck are we dealing with?
Some kind of genjutsu?
Who are they?
Surrender your scroll!
Surrender your scroll!
Surrender your scroll!
Get it!
It's no use, just save it!
It's phantoms!
It's an empty illusion for the eyes!
Illusion? But how?
Was that gash on Kabuto injured?
That's true.
But still, Sasuke is right.
He could be hiding somewhere in the woods nearby.
He's the one that's attacking me,
doing it simultaneously with the phantoms.
He can manipulate them with illusory attacks,
attacking themselves.
That's the phantom technique.
Well done.
Well, well, I'll find the coward that threw the knife in the back
and finish him off!
Naruto, wait!
They'd like to make an effort to get us through the forest.
He's hiding his location very well.
One by one.
We're making the job easy for him.
I know this from my experience.
I can use it to do so because the anti-tank jujutsu
doesn't have enough close combat technique.
We've no choice.
The only thing we can do is hold our ground
and find out their attacks.
Okay, come!
Whatever it takes, do it!
How long are they gonna last?
The night is over.
Man, how long is this gonna last?
Okay, this isn't gonna last.
No, don't do this, Naruto.
You'll only waste your chakra
by trying to like the phantoms you're attacking
just what they want.
If we were to eliminate all the phantoms
at the same time,
then we're gonna have a little bit of a little bit of a rest
before they're gonna be able to see the writing.
I'll show them to you when they're ready.
I'll show them to you when they're ready.
I'll show them to you when they're ready.
I'll show them to you when they're ready.
I'll show them to you when they're ready.
I'll show them to you when they're ready.
Shadow Cloning.
Come on, Sakuura, come on!
I'm with you!
resources
I'm still not done!
I'm done.
Sun's already shining.
Time to get the loot out.
Mubi, it's time.
We've come this far.
Now it's time to take what we need.
Lucky us.
You!
I know you.
You're the one who put me on my shoulder.
That really was unpleasant.
Oh, I was waiting for our meeting.
Finally, I've got a chance to pay you back.
You're the one who cut me on the shoulder.
That really was unpleasant.
Finally, I've got a chance to pay you back.
With interest.
Well, well, now we're in our trap.
Great job.
Right, Naruto?
What?
It can't be.
How did we do it?
And who's there?
Stupid.
We're finally going to see your stupid faces.
How?
This guy.
It's not normal.
I used my clones as bait.
I used my clones as bait.
I used my clones as bait.
I used my clones as bait.
And you didn't notice that I redid the most of them.
While our test gave us a right to our meeting,
we were so outweighed that you showed yourself.
What do you think of this?
Our little flame worked.
Naruto!
Take a break.
You've used too much chakra.
Don't worry, I'll take care of them.
After all that you've done,
I won't give you the right to take a decisive step.
Wow.
Is this the real Naruto?
What happened?
Did he get this good?
This kid should never be able to do this.
Naruto?
His child is a crazy thing.
To be able to transform three of his clones into clones
after the final attack,
he still has the fighting power.
And all this on the fifth day of the exam.
If he is able to master his chakra right,
this kid will be unstoppable.
Ha! Not bad.
But that doesn't mean he's going to be able to do it.
Ha! Not bad.
But that doesn't mean he's going to be able to do it.
But that doesn't mean he's going to be able to do it.
And besides,
we're running out of time,
and our answer will be decisive.
So we'll just show you what we're capable of.
Ninja Hover!
In two two!
Shadows again?
No, those are regular clones.
It's not going to be easy to beat them.
Be careful.
Regular clones?
I'm going to do everything I can
even if I have to kill them one by one.
No, don't waste your strength.
Shut up!
It's my time!
No, Naruto!
Come back!
Not again.
No, don't waste your strength.
Just give me a little bit more pain in the neck
and instead of using my shooting gun,
I'll maybe be able to use more of my chakra.
So that one's gone!
And that one!
And that one!
Naruto, come on!
They're all clones.
It's some kind of an illusion.
Got to...
use the last...
Charging Gun!
Charging Gun!
Sasuke!
The mark again!
Sasuke, don't use the Charging Gun!
Be careful!
Kabuto!
Now you're gonna pay!
No, Naruto!
You can sweep the guys all day.
You're just wasting your time on them.
The real ones aren't there.
What are you talking about? That left didn't come from any clone!
Of course they won't be here! They gotta be here!
If they're not, then where the hell are they?
I don't know where they're hiding.
I'm the answer to that when I'm in the midst of this.
I'm exhausted.
Can't you just stop? Don't do this anymore!
Looks like they're in their own world.
No one else.
It was fun while it lasted.
That's it!
That's what I'm talking about!
They were underground, acting in the shadow of clones!
Kabuto!
Kabuto!
Kabuto!
Kabuto!
Kabuto!
Like you said, never get your head open in fights.
Thank you, Naruto.
You saved my neck.
Way to go, Naruto!
Eh, it was nothing.
That mark on your neck...
What is it?
It looks like a terrible scar.
It's nothing.
Hey, guys! Here it is!
Just look! It's Justin Scrawl!
Good for you!
There's something about this guy.
Something's going on.
There you go, Kabuto.
There you go, Kabuto.
You're late, Kabuto.
Sorry about that.
I got a little sidetracked.
Yeah, we finally did!
It's only next year when we have those Scrawls!
Not really.
You guys did it on your own.
Especially in the end, though.
Very good, Naruto.
Well, there's a door keeping through.
So long, and good luck to us both.
Right!
Good luck!
A good job, I think.
Yes.
Better than I expected.
I learned a lot about everything you may say
and I learned all the data on this.
You want it?
Of course.
So tell me what you think.
What do you want to hear from me,
Rotimaru?
I want to hear your opinion
as a spy in a village
hidden in sound.
Why would you need my opinion?
You're the only one making decisions here.
You're a good guy.
You're in your repertoire.
I like you.
Good work.
What's the deal?
There's nobody here.
It's okay, Sakura.
I can stand on my own.
Oh, sure.
What the hell?
I didn't think that.
I don't get it.
What do we do now?
Hold on a second.
Just look at that.
Great!
What is it?
If quality is the thing,
we'll need to design.
If quality is the thing,
we'll need to design.
If quality is the thing,
we'll need to design.
If quality is the thing,
we'll need to design.
If the heaven and earth are open together,
the parallel will become righteous careers.
This something is a secret way
that God took a place today.
What does all that mean?
It's a secret too.
It's like there's a word missing here.
Anyway, it's about the scrolls.
I think we're supposed to open
and read the heaven and earth scrolls now.
The heaven and earth scrolls now?
Uh-huh.
It...
It's not far, man.
Okay.
Here goes nothing.
I don't want it anymore
Because everyone is in my hands now
I want to cry, I want to run away
If I forget happiness, everyone will sing
Light was born, darkness was born
Two are one, they are harmonious
Can you hear me?
Hey, what's the big idea?
What else is everybody doing here?
Hinata, Kiba, Tsukomaru, there's a whole bunch of them here
Rock Lee and his team, and all the other weirdos
Oh well, that means that I get more respect when I do all of them
Because I am the new Kage
