        <pre>Naruto
Effort does not mean anything to you, we will show you what is called the wall.
The falcon is blooming!
You are moving fast, but this is nothing compared to the speed of sound.
Leif, what's wrong with you?
My ear!
Oh, I forgot to tell you about my little trick.
You might be able to get away from my blows, but you can't get away from this.
What trick has he come up with now?
I don't even need to use my fists, I can beat you with the power of sound.
Sound? What makes us possible to hear things that truly?
Vibrations!
The young lady has earned the award. It is the vibration of the air that creates the ear wave.
These vibrations get into the ear and then into the drum earlobe.
The drum earlobe can withstand sound pressure of no more than 150 decibels.
If the power of sound is higher, it will affect the external hearing passages.
And you will not be able to maintain your balance.
Feeling dizzy, nauseous?
That's right. Even the best of you will not be able to stand on your feet.
You see, your outdated technology is useless against us.
You're not that bad, but the thing is that your technology is from yesterday.
That stuff's totally yeses.
See, I can manipulate your sound with waves and air pressure.
I can do things you never even dreamed of.
Take this, you lazy lotus!
I can open your ears, open your nose, and make the ground softer than it was then.
Facing the future, you're up against the technology of the future.
Remember, this technology can only be used in the last case.
And only to protect those who are precious to you.
Right, only to protect someone who's very precious to me.
You've done well.
I'll never know where you're going with this, you lovable mop top.
I'm proud of you, Lee.
Now it's your turn, girl.
No!
What?
Lee!
Hurricane!
You can't move as fast as you used to.
But I like that you're able to move at all.
Well, we're going to have to do something about that.
Get out!
You hear that?
This device is strengthening the vibration of the impact,
transforming this sound wave.
Lee, no!
I can control this wave with my own chakra,
and send its energy wherever I need it.
Stop!
That's it, baby.
The game is over.
That's what you think!
I almost forgot about you.
These guys are scary.
I've got to get out of here.
Sasuke and Naruto are out.
And Lee isn't in shape either.
It's just Sakura left alone against the three of them.
Well, what are we going to do?
Ino?
Why ask me that?
Well, if we don't do something, it's over.
Are you going to do that?
You and Ino were friends once, right?
By the way, Ino,
uh, yeah.
By the way, Ino,
uh,
Well, what are you looking at, Sakura?
Why are you looking so sad?
It's just...
I heard you...
Come on, Ino.
Well, is it true that you like Sasuke too?
So, I guess that means...
We're rivals from now on.
Get a grip, Ino.
That's all in the past.
Well,
Ino.
So, what do you want to do?
Why do you keep asking me that?
Why do you keep asking me that?
What am I supposed to do?
You want me to go out there and die?
I mean, that's all that was waiting for me,
just being the same as her.
Just being the same as her.
Would that do anybody?
Get him!
A couple of meters, he threw away my shurikens!
My, my, what soft and shiny hair.
You know,
you need to be a little less careful with your appearance
and spend more time in training.
You might not be in space.
You might not be in space.
You might not be in space.
You might not be in space.
Zaku, let's have some fun.
Let this beauty look at you
when you chop that Sasuke guy.
What a great idea.
It's going to be fun.
Don't you dare touch him!
Don't even!
Sakura.
It's no use.
I've got no more strength left.
Sakura.
What's wrong with you, Sakura?
You can't do anything.
You never could.
Even now,
when the other people need me,
I'm powerless.
How many times have they saved my life?
I thought that one day
when the question of life and death
arises,
I can handle it.
Okay,
let's end it.
Man,
this thing is really ugly.
What do I do?
What do I do?
Come on.
It's pointless.
It won't work for you.
It's not meant for you.
What?
I've always considered myself
to be a real ninja.
I thought I was madly in love
with Sasuke.
I claim that I'm madly in love
with Sasuke.
And I'm always like Naruto.
It's like I know
so much.
But it's all empty.
And I'm always like Naruto.
It's like I know so much.
But it's all empty.
And I'm always like Naruto.
But it's all empty.
Because they were always
in front of me.
And I was just behind them.
Why did that happen?
Stay behind me!
It's okay. I got you covered.
Okay.
No more games.
No more games.
I got you covered.
I got you covered.
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
You bat!
No matter what
was going on
they were always there
to protect me.
And Lee,
your words of love
You proved it!
I will give my life for you!
Lotus Technique!
We were not in the same team, but you didn't spare your life for me.
All this time you've been teaching me something new.
Hey, Sakura!
Sakura!
It's about time I learned the lesson.
Okay.
No more fear.
Now it's my turn to go forward.
And only I will protect you.
Sakura!
Sakura, be careful!
Kin!
Kill her!
What is she doing?
A replacement technique?
You think you can do more?
I'm warning you, you're gonna lose anyway.
Kin, to the side!
Pathetic!
Thank you for the present.
And now catch the hotel from me.
Again with the ass.
It's like the sound wave.
What is it?
Okay, well, where are you now?
You really want me to keep playing this?
It's exactly the news for you.
I'm not going to buy it.
All right.
You want it?
Take it!
Okay, well, where are you now?
No!
Yeah, it's really her!
What are you?
Are you crazy or something?
Get off of me!
Sakura!
Sakura!
Hey, aren't you the one that's always got a big boar head?
Who are you?
Who, me?
Oh, that's easy.
My name is Ina Yamanaka.
Who are you?
My name is...
Sakura.
How?
Be quiet.
I can't hear you.
Let's do it again, okay?
Who are you?
My name is Sakura.
That's better.
So this is the famous boar head.
Whoa, it is kind of big.
So that's why I'm hiding it.
That's dumb.
Just much worse.
Makes you look like a sheep.
So your name is Sakura?
Uh-huh.
Hey, you know what?
I've got something for you.
Come back here tomorrow, okay?
Huh?
Somebody get away from me!
Hey!
See?
It's so much better.
You look a lot better.
You can have whatever you want.
You can have whatever you want.
You look a lot better.
You can have whatever you want.
Oh.
Thanks.
But...
Huh?
But what?
My boar head.
Oh, come on.
I'm telling you, the more you try to hide it,
the bigger the thing will get.
And your face is nice.
Actual.
Very nice.
You just have to be more confident.
Confident.
Hi, Inna.
Hey, who are you?
Who's she?
This is Sakura.
Come on.
Don't you want to say hello?
Hi.
Get her!
Get her!
Hey, everyone.
I've got some news.
It's a secret.
It's a secret.
It's a secret.
It's a secret.
It's a secret.
It's a secret.
It's a secret.
It's a secret.
It's a secret.
It's a secret.
It's a secret.
What?
How did you know?
Take a turn.
Sasuke is the most popular guy ever.
That's all.
He is?
Oh.
But yes, that means there's a lot of competition.
Wow.
What a change.
Sakura has changed a lot.
She still hasn't she?
Sometimes I miss it.
Hey, Inu.
I just found out that Sasuke likes girls with long hair.
Well, is it true what I heard from Sasuke?
Guess now we're rivals from now on.
Well, well, I see someone's grown her hair.
Looks like I'm not the only one.
If you think he likes you because you're in the same team with him,
know that you're wrong.
I mean, Inu, I'm going to win.
Oh, you think so?
You'll never beat me, Sakura.
No matter how hard you try.
Sakura!
Sakura!
I have to win.
Now you're going to pay.
Oh, man.
This is bad.
Well, Inu.
It's all on me.
There's no other way.
Say goodbye to life, Kinder.
So what's this reinforcement doing?
Inu?
Surprised?
I swear I never let you show me that you can beat me.
You remember?
To be continued...
To be continued...
To be continued...
To be continued...
This is Inu's fight.
I have to admit, her team is tough.
Where did they learn that?
They came to my rescue.
And maybe with their help I can get Sasuke out of this mess.
Next time in Battle Formation,
I'll see Sasuke too.
At least Sasuke will wake up.
But something's wrong with him.
