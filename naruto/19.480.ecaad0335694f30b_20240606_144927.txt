Naruto
For the sake of no one, for the sake of no one
Our present
Pain, hold on key, heart, hold on key
Shadow, hold on key
Take a breath, run through the darkness
Fighting, loving, it's not over
Moon and relax
Zabdza, you killed me!
Goto, why did you come here?
And what are your subordinates doing here?
The plans have slightly changed
I'm sorry, Zabdza, but I need you to die here
What did you say?
It's too expensive to hire reliable ninjas, so I hired running ninjas like you
And if you kill each other, I won't spend any money or time at all
I don't care about the devil from the village, hidden in the fog
For me, you're just a little cute little thing
What are they? There are so many of them!
Kakashi, I'm sorry
It looks like our battle is over
Now that I have no reason to kill Tadzun, I have a reason to fight you
Yeah, that's right
I remember that I owed this guy
He was holding my hand until it broke
He's dead!
You bastard! What are you doing?
Stop it! You're acting unthinkably
And you too! Say something! You weren't friends, were you?
Shut up, boy! Haku is already dead
Don't you feel anything when he does that? We were always together!
Just like Goto used me, I used Haku, that's all
I told you, we are just tools
All I needed was his abilities, not him
And I have no regrets
Are you serious?
Enough, Naruto. There's no need to fight him anymore
Shut up! He's still my enemy!
He really loved you!
Do you have a loved one?
To what extent did he love you?
When a person protects what is dear to him, he becomes really strong
Do you really not feel anything?
It's hard for me to become a real Shinobi
Do you really not feel anything?
I want to fulfill his dreams. For this, I can become a real Shinobi
Do I really have to become as strong as you when I become as strong as you?
He gave up his life for you!
And you...
I want to fulfill his dreams. That is my dream
I have never seen my dreams
I was so happy. He was just a weapon for you
It's too sad
Good luck
Don't say anything anymore
Haku fought not only for me
You fought for me
You fought for me
You fought for me
Haku fought not only for me
He fought for you too
I can understand. He was too kind
I'm glad we met
I'm glad we met
Yes, man
In the end, everything is exactly as you say
Shinobis are also people
Perhaps we can't become a senseless tool
I lost
Lost
Hey, give me your kunai for a while
Enough! Hey, you! Finish them off quickly!
Yes, fool! Do you think he can defeat so many enemies?
No!
Devil?
Haku!
If you want to go to your friend, go there alone!
I'm sorry
But I'm not going there
Where did Haku go?
What are you doing? Stop it!
You will go to hell with me
Even an ordinary demon from Kirigakuri
When you go to hell, you can become a real devil
Just imagine
In hell you can check as many times as you want
Am I really a little cute mitten?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Haku
Haku
The time has come to say goodbye, Haku
Thank you for everything
I'm sorry
Don't look back
This is the last moment of a person who has lived a crazy life
Am I dead?
Sasuke-kun
Sakura
I
I
Sakura, it's hard for me
Sasuke-kun
Sasuke-kun
Sasuke-kun
Sakura, it's hard for me
Sakura, it's hard for me
No, you can't move
What about Naruto and that bastard in the mask?
Naruto is fine, but in the mask he died
How did he die? Did Naruto kill him?
No, I don't know for sure, but
He protected Zabuza and
I believed you, Sasuke-kun
As expected, Sasuke-kun is a life-threatening organ
He is from the very beginning
Naruto
Sakura-chan
Sasuke-kun is fine, he is alive
Sasuke-kun
Haku fought with you, worrying about you
He was too kind
So what? He
I see, so Sasuke is fine too
That's good
Hey, hey
Hey
You are too calm
Damn ninja, you killed our only source of income
Then we have nothing left to do but walk around this town and collect everything that is valuable there
Yes
Kakashi-sensei, don't you have any kind of jutsu to bang and that's it?
It's useless, I spent all the money
Go
Go
Shalapai who dare to take another step towards the village will be killed immediately, we will stop you with our strength
Inari
Heroes always appear at the last moment, don't they?
Inari
Guys
So, I will support them too
Kagebunsino Jutsu
Well, since the matter has begun, then I will bluff the remaining chakras
Kagebunsino Jutsu
Kakashi version
Well, try it
Kagebunsino Jutsu
Yes
It seems everything is over
Kakashi
Kakashi
I have a request
What?
I would really like to look at his face
Yes
Of course
Kagebunsino Jutsu
Snow
Snow at this time of year?
Hakuyo
Hakuyo
Are you crying?
I'm sorry, Kakashi
You have always been by my side
And all I can do now is to be by your side
I'm sorry
If I could, I would like to go there, wherever you go
Together
Kagebunsino Jutsu
He was born in a village where snow often comes
I see
That's it
This child was pure as white snow
You can go, Zabuza
There, together with him
Well, listen, Kakashi-sensei
Is the true essence of the ninja in the house what these two were talking about?
Shinobi should not establish its own reasons for existence
It is very important to exist as a simple tool
The same is true in our village of Kanoha
So becoming a real ninja just means that?
You know, you know what? I don't like it at all
Do you think so too?
I don't like it either
That's why those who call themselves ninjas live involuntarily, suffering from this problem
Just like Zabuza and this boy
Okay
I decided I would go my way, Shinobi
I will go my way, Shinobi, on a path where there will be no regrets
I will go my way
Thanks to you, the construction of the bridge is completed, but it becomes so sad
Take care of yourself
Thank you for everything
Come on, Grandpa Tadzuna, we'll come visit you again
You will definitely come
Inari
Are you sad?
It's okay to cry at such moments
Cry, I wasn't going to cry
This is for you, brother Naruto, you can cry
Oh, that's it
Come on, bye
So, God of War
They don't give it to the ninjas
This young man changed Inari's heart, and Inari then changed the spirit of the inhabitants of the entire village
This guy built us a bridge that leads to hope and is called courage
Bridge, then
By the way, since we are talking about bridges, maybe we should give this bridge some name
Oh yes, I have a great name for this bridge
And what is it?
How about the Great Bridge Naruto?
Good name
So, let's go home faster, Iruka-sensei, he will treat me to ramen
And we also need to talk about our heroic feats, Konohamaru
Well, what about me?
Sasuke-kun, maybe after we get back, we'll have a date?
No, thank you
What is it?
Well, listen, I don't mind at all
I'm sick of it, shut up
What is it? Are you sure this is the right name?
You know, this name has an unwavering faith in the fact that this bridge will never be destroyed
And that there will be a day when it will become famous and fame will spread all over the world
Yes, definitely
Iruka-sensei

7th grade
Well, well, we've been doing simple tasks lately, haven't we?
There are a lot of cool ninjas like Zabuza and Haku in the city of Takoko.
Isn't there something more exciting that I can do?
My personality is like this! My heart is like this!
Next time, we'll break into the new city!
It's an admission test!
This is my personality!
