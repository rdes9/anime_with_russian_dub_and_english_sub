Gently, open it, get it, take it all
I'm sure it will reach you, I'm sure it will reach you
Ah
Take a breath, take a breath
It seems to be lost, but the melody is always so close
Take a breath, take a breath
It doesn't mean anything if it's not a dream
Far away
What is this?
Where am I?
Who's this?
It's me.
A mom-to-be.
Father and mother shouldn't have died.
It shouldn't have happened.
They're all dead.
Because I was weak and I couldn't save them.
My whole clan is destroyed.
My whole clan is destroyed.
Unbeatable team! Ino Shikachou!
Ino!
Don't want me!
I'm telling you, you don't live in Furusaka.
You need to get all of the credit!
These knuckle-knucklers,
they're swarming with trouble.
Are you out of your mind?
What are we doing here?
These guys are gonna kill us, man!
Don't make me think it's Ino's idea.
What was it to do?
Just slap like girls?
Fighting?
Sorry to drag you into this,
but we're a team.
One for all, all for one.
Yeah, what's meant to be, we will.
Team, it's suicide!
Let me go!
Let me go!
Stop pissing me off.
A living sheep is better than a dead lion.
Right, fat pig?
Did I hear you right?
Right?
What did he just say?
Say?
Huh?
Uh-oh.
Just don't show it when they call it that.
You want to try me again?
I said, you're swarming with trouble,
fat pig.
How are you?
I'm not a fat pig!
I'm just a solid body!
I'm going to show you!
Uh-huh.
Does it!
I'm being insulted!
Now fight to the death between leaf and sound!
Excellent.
He's fired up.
Good job.
Now we're definitely going to get into trouble.
Don't worry.
We've got to get rid of these clowns.
Sasuke's our target.
Sasuke.
Sakura.
Your teammates are down.
Look after them.
Okay, Team Ino.
Let's see who's in charge.
Yeah!
Team Ino!
Chica!
Cho!
Okay, take it away, Choji.
My pleasure.
Listen, group of happens.
This is the end of the senate term Big Muscle!
Fight to the death between leaf and sound!
Int deserving tank.
You gotta be kidding.
Man, if it didn't get through.
What are you doing lads?
Slicing.
It should be in the air.
This thing's spinning way too fast.
The air wave can't control it.
And if I use the supersonic waves,
it'll break my arms in.
Huh?
Zaku!
Zaku!
Zaku!
Zaku!
Zaku!
Zaku!
Zaku!
Zaku!
Zaku!
No, you don't want to help him.
You're the shadow trap!
What's happening!?
Just me and my shadow!
What is it? Why are you just standing there?
That's why you're paralyzed, Tsutsu.
Ino, I'll leave the girl to you.
Okay, you got it.
Just take care of my body while I'm gone.
Sure.
Tsutsu, mind transfer!
Huh?
Enough of this!
Kin!
What's wrong with you?
Party's over, guys.
Take your seats, and put a knife in the eyes of your stupid girlfriend.
You don't want this to happen.
So here's to you, drop the school and walk away.
When your friends the way they can't, then you talk to them.
I'll let her go.
I don't get these guys. What's wrong?
Hey, Tsutsu!
What is it? What's the matter with you?
This is bad.
I don't feel well.
I don't understand these guys.
What kind of a monster would attack his girlfriend?
I guess you haven't seen monsters like this before.
You see, we don't need this kind of rules.
It's not a school rule. We can pass this test.
What?
What then?
Sasuke.
As always, at the wrong time.
So, I'm looking at the action of your paralysis limited to time.
It's not paralysis, it's a shadow trap.
What difference does it make?
And I see your girlfriend can move her soul into the enemy's body.
Smart, but dangerous.
Anything that happens to Kin, it's reflected on her.
If you kill Kin, she'll die too.
What are you going to do?
Kill your teammate?
Well, if it comes to show, yeah.
Oh, man, what a drag.
Yeah, no kidding.
Did you really think you could beat us?
You're not just a bunch of deletants from a second-rate village.
Second-rate? Tough talk.
So, your village is third-rate.
I wonder if any of these amateurs are ready to take on the real threat.
What?
It's Lee's team.
I wonder how they got in here.
Lee!
You blew it.
How many of you are here, Konoksky losers?
Looks like someone used our comrade as a punch in the head.
We don't forgive anyone for this.
His eyes, he's not just looking at us.
He's seeing through us.
No more fooling around.
Full power!
What's the matter, Nedji?
That chakra.
Well, are you going to be there all day?
Or are you going to be down here at the end of the tunnel?
Actually, looks like I'm taking it out of my hands.
Because I was too weak, everyone died.
I couldn't save them.
If only I was stronger.
If only I had the strength.
Instead, you just stood and watched them die.
You just stood and watched them die.
You just stood and watched them die.
You just stood and watched them die.
So helpless, like a lamb before the lamb.
If only you were stronger.
If only you had the strength.
Sasuke, I'm so happy!
Sasuke?
Is that Sasuke?
Sakura.
Who did this?
Who was it?
Those marks.
They're all over his body.
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
What's going on?
Don't worry.
I'm all right.
It's only the powerful power that gives me the power.
I've never felt better.
He gave me this gift, he gave me this understanding of who I am.
I'm an avenger.
To reach my goal, I need strength at any cost, even if it's the devilish nature.
And now I see.
The seal that the girl was asking about was cursed.
How could he survive after her?
More than survive.
More than survive.
Sakura, tell me.
Which one of them gives to you?
That'd be me.
Inu!
Hurry up and get back to your body, or you're going to get all wet.
You, Joji, run over there!
I'm coming!
My soul, release!
Atticus, you're back.
Shikamaru, what's going on?
What's going on?
How should I know?
What is this?
This is incredible.
His chakras are too strong.
I can't believe it.
I can't believe it.
I can't believe it.
I can't believe it.
I can't believe it.
This is incredible.
His chakras are too strong.
Too powerful.
We can't...
We can't handle him.
Zosu, what's wrong?
You're not going to surrender, are you?
No, Zaku, you don't understand.
Right, I'm going to show you.
I'm not going to hurt my friends.
It's a supersonic sound disc.
Ah!
What do you mean?
Blow away, you knucklehead!
Not quite.
Zaku!
Such speed.
He got all my friends out of the way in a blink of an eye.
Fireballs.
The immortal fire of the phoenix.
So try this.
Is the flame...
Zaku, get down!
Get down!
His chakras...
It's completely different.
It's stronger.
Darker.
It can't be Sasuke.
You seem to be very proud of your hands.
You must be attached to them.
No!
What are you doing?
You want it, Sasuke.
You want to become strong, don't you?
It looks like you're the only one left.
I hope it's going to be more interesting than your friend.
No!
It's not...
It can't be!
Whoever it may be, it's not Sasuke.
No!
Stop!
No!
Don't do it!
Stop!
Please!
The marks are disappearing.
We're safe now.
Sasuke!
You're strong, Sasuke.
Too strong.
We can't hope to defeat you right now.
We'll sign a deal.
I give you the scroll and you let us go.
We underestimated you,
but now we know what we need.
For the moment, we've lost.
But if it's going to be another battle against you,
I promise we won't run away
and we won't hide.
Wait!
Stop!
Wait!
Who is this Aratimaru?
What did he do to Sasuke?
And why did he choose Sasuke?
I don't know.
All I know is that all he does gets us,
and we did.
I don't know why he sent us
to someone with such powers.
I don't know why Sasuke survived
after the cursed seal.
There are too many of them.
I don't know.
Hey, guys! How are you?
Ino, you check out the king.
We'll take care of the king.
Okay.
This is a normal chakra.
I didn't know that a clone of quiet
has such power.
Sakura is in danger.
Don't worry.
It's under control.
I'll save you.
We need to push him away so he wakes up.
This is awkward.
Can I do this?
What happened to me?
Where am I?
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
It's not like that.
Well, let's go for a walk?
Come on, are you looking for a teleporter pole?
In the next episode...
Takamaru is in horror!
The incredible power of Gaara!
Then what the hell is it?
