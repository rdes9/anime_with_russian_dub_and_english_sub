        <pre>About me
Tell me about all languages
My dignity melts
I become a porcupine
It's not for anyone, it's not for anyone
Our present is
Unleash the pain, unleash the heart, unleash the shadow
Take a breath and run through the darkness
Fighting and loving each other
The end is yet to come
Unleash the pain, unleash the shadow
The end is yet to come
What is this? Who do you think you are?
Battle on the bridge! Zabudze returns!
Good morning, everyone!
Here. Oh, thank you!
Naruto is not here. Looks like he didn't spend the night at home.
He's gone completely crazy, he's gone completely crazy, he's gone completely crazy in the dark.
He could be sad right now, you know, he's been exhausted by his chakra.
Well, I certainly hope he's okay. A child spending the night in the woods alive.
Don't worry about it. Naruto's got the looks of a boy, but he's also a real ninja.
He can handle this. Sakura's right.
Naruto's such a fool. He's probably lying there somewhere dead.
Sasuke!
I'm going for a walk.
But we just started eating!
Huh?
That was fast!
You'll catch cold if you sleep on the ground. Wake up!
Who the heck are you?
I'm Sasuke.
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Who the heck are you?
Oh!
Uh...
Uh...
I mean...
Hi there, where did you come from?
You know, what are you doing out here and all that?
I'm gathering herbs.
Herbs?
Yeah, that's right.
To treat illnesses and healing wounds.
You started early, huh, sir?
I like it.
It's calm now.
I didn't think I'd find anyone sleeping in the forest.
I'm training, sir.
So are you a ninja?
Because I noticed that you had a band-aid on your head.
Or are you just making a flash statement?
You know what I mean?
Alright!
Alright!
Alright!
Alright!
Alright!
Alright!
Alright!
Alright!
Alright!
Alright!
Alright!
Only super cool ninja can wear these!
Oh, really?
I see that's very impressive.
But...
Does that mean you're training for something more dangerous?
I'm just training to get stronger!
You seem very strong now, Sasuke.
Not enough?
No, no, I need to get stronger!
Stronger!
I have to keep practicing!
Oh, so...
Why is it so important?
So I can become the best ninja in my family!
And everyone will know who I am and they'll all respect me!
There's also a certain core that I can't be!
I have to prove something, too!
So are you doing this for a certain person?
Or are you doing this for yourself?
What are you laughing at?
What's so funny?
Is there someone else precious to you?
Someone who?
What do you say it is?
What do you mean, precious?
Oh!
What are you thinking?
You see...
When you first learn how to protect someone precious to you,
then you become truly strong.
Hmm...
Hmm...
Hmm...
Hmm...
Hmm...
Hmm...
Hmm...
Hmm...
Hmm...
Hmm...
Hmm...
Hmm...
Hmm...
Hmm...
This is our village and we have to protect you at any cost.
I'll protect you with my life.
All of you.
If you ever lay a hand on my sensei...
I'll kill you!
Yeah!
I hear you!
I know what you're saying!
You will be strong.
Very strong.
Goodbye.
We'll meet again.
Oh.
By the way...
I'm a boy.
No!
No!
He's prettier than Sakura!
Whoa!
I see a lot of things in my life before, but this one is the cake!
Ow!
Hey!
What did you do that for?
What about now?
Did you just forget about breakfast?
You're such a moron.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Naruto!
Knowing Naruto, he could be anywhere.
And Sasuke hasn't been back yet.
I wonder where they are.
Wow!
Naruto climbed so high using his chakra!
That's great!
What do you think?
High enough for you guys?
You think he's going to stay down, huh?
Naruto!
Just kidding!
You guys clearly fell for it!
We were worried about you, Naruto!
I'm going to strangle you!
You're an idiot!
Why do I have a feeling that this is going to end badly?
You just had to listen, didn't you, Joe?
You really are a total idiot, Naruto!
Sasuke!
Alright, Sasuke, you're back!
If I'm still studying, it's going to be a miracle.
Naruto!
Naruto Uzumaki!
You're recovering quickly.
Just a little further, Haku.
Yes.
Let's go back.
Alright!
Now that both of them are gone,
I wouldn't have stuck with Sasuke.
What are you doing?
I'm going to the bathroom.
I'm going to the bathroom.
I'm going to the bathroom.
I'm going to the bathroom.
One of you got something that looks good.
We both made it!
We both are going to the top!
Good.
Now we move on.
By tomorrow, bodyguard Tatsuno.
Alright!
You are such a loser!
In a few more days,
hey, we're going to finish the bridge,
and everything's going to be thanks to you.
But still, don't forget to be careful.
I've been meaning to ask you for a long time,
and I haven't had a chance to jump in.
Why did you say you'd protect me,
even though you know I lied to you here?
Those who say the path of truth has no courage,
but under the wing of a strong leader,
cowardice does not stand still.
Huh?
That was a quote from the first Hakage.
Hmm.
If you care about anything,
keep fighting with all your might.
Inari, don't cry.
Why?
What did you say?
All this stupid training is just a waste of time.
Gato has an army.
He'll beat you down and he'll destroy you.
These cool things you say,
they don't mean anything.
How long are we going to wait?
Just long on the sweet and the weak.
Always lose.
Just be like that.
It won't be like that.
Me, I've got that.
I'm sick of you.
You don't know anything about our country.
You're just talking.
You're always laughing and playing.
You don't know how it hurts
when you're being treated like dirt.
Listen to yourself.
You lie, you take a pill,
and you're complaining like a normal victim.
Look, you can live a hard day for all I care.
You're just a coward.
Naruto, you went too far.
Naruto?
Can I talk to you?
Naruto can be a little harsh sometimes,
but he doesn't feel bad about you.
Your grandfather told us
what happened to your father.
You probably don't know,
but Naruto also grew up without a father.
In fact, he doesn't know
neither his father nor his mother.
And he didn't have a father
or a mother in the village.
Still, I've never seen him cry,
complain, lower his hands.
He's always eager to fight.
He wants to be respected.
That's his dream.
And he'll put his life
in a heart with ease.
My guess is he's tired of crying
and decided to do something about it.
He's tired of crying
and decided to do something about it.
Even though he's young,
he's still young,
he knows what it is to be strong,
like your father did.
I think he knows better than all of us
what you're going through.
What Naruto told you
is no matter how cruel they sound,
he's probably repeated himself
a thousand times.
Okay, I'm putting Naruto
on your hands.
He's pushed to the limit
of overdoing it as he always does.
So, he may not be able
to move at all.
What about you?
You still haven't recovered.
Why, do I look wobbly?
Don't worry about me.
Okay, let's go.
Still wasting time
licking wounds?
I hired you to do a job,
are you listening, Zabuza?
Hey!
Haku, you ready?
Yes.
Why didn't you wake me up?
Where are they?
Where are they all going?
Oh, Naruto,
I said you had to rest.
You got the PR.
I knew it! They kicked me!
See ya!
They couldn't have woken me up!
Hold on!
What the heck is this?
What happened?
Someone was here! Someone got to them!
Could it be?
Inari!
Could you give me a hand?
Inari!
I'll be right there!
This mist!
Sasuke! Sakura! Get ready!
I knew he was alive.
I just couldn't wait for round two.
Kakashi-sensei,
it's Zabuza, isn't it?
This is his hidden misdemeanor!
This is his hidden misdemeanor!
This is his hidden misdemeanor!
This is his hidden misdemeanor!
This is his hidden misdemeanor!
This is his hidden misdemeanor!
Sorry I made you wait,
Kakashi.
I see you again,
these suckers.
That one's trembling with fear.
What a pity.
I'm trembling with
excitement.
Go on, Sasuke!
I can see them.
I can see them.
I can see them.
I can see them.
I can see them.
So you can see my water ghosts?
So you can see my water ghosts?
You've learned something.
Looks like you have an opponent,
Haku.
Looks like it.
Haku!
Haku!
Haku!
Haku!
Haku!
Haku!
Haku!
Haku!
Haku!
Haku!
Haku!
Haku!
Haku!
Haku!
Haku!
Haku!
Haku!
Haku!
Haku!
Haku!
Haku!
Haku!
Haku!
Haku!
Haku!
Haku!
Haku!
Haku!
Haku!
Haku!
Haku!
Haku!
Haku!
Haku!
Haku!
Haku!
Haku!
Haku!
Haku!
Okay, so I slept late, don't think I'm going to miss the answer to that.
Whoa, Inari, look at you, you're getting far ahead, partner.
Well, Inari has a big hero, so maybe it's over for her now.
Wait a minute, what about the teacher Kakashi and the others?
If they're in danger, I've got to get over there.
Next up, I've got some secret kids in the crystal ice mirrors.
So right this way, I'll have to get lost like never before.
