Naruto
You always so lazy?
Where's that weird blond with his friends?
They're training to climb trees.
That's too tough for you.
No, that's what I'm the best at.
And that's why Master Kakashi sent me to guard you.
You're kidding me.
Tatsuno.
I need to talk to you.
What about?
The thing is, I've been thinking a lot about the ring.
And I decided I'd push my luck far enough.
I'm leaving.
What?
You're quitting me?
You're kidding me.
You know, I said I'm not leaving because we're friends.
But I'm planning my life on that.
We gotta stay here.
Gato and his friends will show up eventually.
When they do, they'll kill you and the bridge will never be completed.
It's a lost cause, Tatsuno.
Why don't we stop now?
We should get out of this alive.
No way.
This is our bridge.
Our island is poor.
And it will stay that way until the bridge connects us with the continent.
New people, trade, hope.
That's what building here is gonna be for a world day.
It's already day.
Let's break our lunch.
Tatsuno, don't do this.
Don't waste words.
Save your breath.
No.
And geese, don't bother working after lunch.
The land where the hero once lived.
Why is this so hard?
I'm not giving you your hand.
I'm not giving you your hand.
Where are we going?
Where are we going?
You want to eat, don't you?
I've got to pick up some things for dinner.
Thief! Thief!
What's wrong with these people?
Here we are.
Welcome.
This is a store?
There's nothing here.
You pervert!
No!
I wasn't for that!
Wow, you really surprised me.
Girls are really able to fight like that.
They should!
Something serious is going on here.
What?
Again?
Hey, butler!
Please.
Here.
Thank you.
This is how it's been since Gato appeared.
The children suffer,
and the adults are afraid to say a word.
They've lost all hope.
That's why we have to build a bridge
and break cars and trains.
It's much more important than that.
The bridge is a symbol of courage.
It must restore our spirit of faith.
When the bridge is finished,
people will start to believe again.
They'll believe that they can live with dignity.
We can't let Gato stop us.
Sasuke, Naruto,
we have to help them.
He's still alive!
That's impossible!
Damn!
He's catching up with me!
No, no, no!
When I think about Sasuke,
I lose my concentration!
Believe it!
Come on, Naruto!
Set yourself up!
Hey, you're good at this.
How about some advice?
All right.
Chakra requires spiritual energy.
That's why you can't lose concentration.
Relax.
Focus on the tree.
And that's how you get it.
If you chakra, you'll get it on your feet.
Relax.
Focus on the tree.
Yeah, I can feel it!
I'm going to make it!
Hey, Naruto!
Sasuke!
What are you doing?
I was trying to focus on the chakra!
Well, you know,
the thing is...
What?
That's strange.
He never talked to me before.
What does he want?
You know,
you asked Sasuke for advice
when she was here.
So what did she tell you?
I'm not telling you.
It's been a long time
since we've had guests.
Adds!
Stop eating!
You're getting fat!
You're getting fat!
You're getting fat!
You're getting fat!
Stop eating!
You're getting fat!
I have to eat more.
I have to eat more than him.
It's the only possible way I can stop him.
That's true.
But Naruto won't help you.
Excuse me.
This picture is torn.
Is there some reason for that?
Inari, you kept staring at her
all night.
It looks like there was someone else in the picture
and they got his face torn off.
I mean, that's kind of strange, isn't it?
It's my husband.
They used to call him a hero in our region.
Inari, where are you going?
Father, you can't talk about him like that.
I mean, Inari, you know that.
Inari's so weird.
I mean, what happened to him?
Is there a story behind this?
He wasn't just my father.
He went to our family later.
And he brought so much happiness to us.
Me and Inari were very close friends.
In those days,
Inari used to have all the time.
But then...
All that ended.
He never laughs, he never smiles.
Ever since that day, everything's changed.
The word courage
lost all its meaning on this island.
We lost hope,
we lost hope and strength,
and Inari suffered the most.
Ever since that day,
ever since that day it happened.
Tell us,
what happened to Inari?
First, you need to know about
the man's father.
The man who taught us that
he was a hero.
A hero, really?
You can decide for yourself.
He came here
about three years ago.
Poti!
Poti, no!
That's not his name.
His name is Shooting Star.
And he's my dog now.
No, he's not his dog.
He's my puppy.
He's like my friend
so I'll get him.
Shut up!
No!
Poti!
See what happened
because you didn't listen to me?
I'm not gonna lift a finger to help him.
Okay, you can let him go.
Why did you do that?
My dog's gonna drown.
If he's your dog,
go get him.
Be a hero and save your friend.
After all that big talk,
you're not gonna let him go under on you.
I've got to jump and save him.
I've got to, but...
You won't even save your precious little Poti.
I...
I can't swim.
I'm scared.
I'm sorry, Poti.
Hey!
You make us feel about it.
Get him!
I think you went too far, Akane.
I mean, he can really drown or something.
Help! Please!
Forget about it.
I don't know.
You say one more word, you're gonna go in the next.
Got it?
I don't wanna die!
Poti!
Interestingly enough,
at that exact moment
Poti learned how to dive.
Meteor's running away!
Get him!
No!
I can't breathe!
I...
Waking up, huh?
Finally.
I had a little talk with these kids.
They won't bother you anymore, Poti.
Here, eat.
Am I alive?
Is this for real?
Did you pull me out of the water, mister?
Have a bite to eat.
Then we can talk about all of that.
Hmm, I see.
Your dog made you tear up.
In my country, dogs are very loyal.
They stand by their masters.
Then again,
on the other hand,
you betrayed the dog first, so
it goes back.
I really wanted to save him,
but I just froze.
I was just so scared.
I guess I just don't have much courage.
Hey, don't be so hard on yourself.
You're a kid.
When I was your age, I'd be scared too.
It's no big deal.
But always remember this.
Huh?
Live your life so you have
nothing to regret.
Huh?
If you care about something expensive,
no matter how tough, no matter how sad,
you've got to keep trying.
Even if you have to put your life on the line.
And with so many arms,
never give in.
His name was Kaidza.
He was a simple fisherman.
He came from another land
after his dream.
From that day on, Inari was following him
like he was stuck.
He didn't know his real father,
so you can imagine what Kaidza meant to him.
He looked up to him.
He was so excited about everything.
They were like real father and son.
Kaidza spent more and more time
with us.
He easily got into our family.
And then he became a hero
for the village.
We've got some trouble, Kaidza.
The planks are open. The water's rising.
If we don't stop it, we'll be flooded.
What?
Mother!
Inari, bring the rope, quick!
See where the gate is?
We've got to get there with the rope.
But we've got to swim there.
And it's impossible.
No one's got enough courage.
Or else we'll all be flooded.
Anyway, I'll do it.
No!
Kaidza!
Don't be foolish.
You'll never make it.
Father!
Don't worry.
Nothing can stop your father.
This is our village,
and we've got to protect it at any cost.
If you care about something,
protect it.
Even if you have to risk your life,
protect it with all your might.
Never give up.
Father!
I know you can do it!
He made it!
He got it!
Close the gate!
Everybody, come on!
Everybody, come on!
From that moment on,
Kaidza became our hero.
He taught us all what courage was,
and Inari was very proud of his father.
But it was long after,
Gato showed up
and took over the power.
He was terrorizing the whole village.
Not a single Kaidza subdued.
Gato couldn't let
a peasant stand in his way.
He took all his strength
to stop one single man.
Well, Kaidza,
you said you were going to protect
the village with your two arms.
Those arms are strong.
Still got that fighting spirit.
Well, my people will break you.
Get to work with him.
Lie down.
Get to work.
Lie down.
Lie down.
Lie down.
Lie down.
Lie down.
Lie down.
Lie down.
Lie down.
Lie down.
Lie down.
Listen up!
This man has been against the Gato Corporation.
He's disturbed the order of the Gato.
He's been sentenced to execution.
Let this be a lesson
for you all to learn
so that no one will dare stand in our way.
Father!
Inari, be quiet.
Do it.
Father!
No!
Father!
You told me
that
you were going to protect
me and our village
with both your arms.
You made me believe
that you could do it.
But it was all just a lie.
Since that day
Inari has changed.
So did tsunami.
So did all our people.
We lost our will.
There's no such things in you.
Only stupid kids believe in you.
What are you doing down there, Naruto?
You better take a break.
No more training.
You've used too many chakras.
If you don't recover your strength,
you'll die.
I'll prove it.
Prove what?
I'll prove that it's true.
That in this world
there are real heroes.
To be continued...
To be continued...
To be continued...
What do you want?
What do you want?
I'm in training right now.
We don't know when Zabuza will attack again.
See, I was told loud and clear
that you have to protect what you care about.
But to be strong,
you have to be strong.
I'll prove it, Inari.
There are real heroes in this world.
Next time,
Battle on the Bridge.
Zabuza is coming back.
I'm going to take one more hour.
You'll see.
