Hey, what is that bad?
Don't you think that was maybe a little over the top?
Yeah, what the hell?
Okay, where's the real Naruto?
Better watch out, Sakura. I think he's gone crazy.
Yeah, right. Then what happened to the knife from the examiner?
What?
And the knife you put on the left leg, not the right one.
Naruto is right-handed.
You're transforming even worse than Naruto.
Tell me who you are.
So you got me. I'm still gonna take your sword.
So which one of you has it?
We'll do it.
We'll do it.
Fire style! Phoenix Flame!
Hey, get me out of here!
Little idiot.
Thank you!
Better keep your eyes open!
A paper bomb?
Sorry, this is the exam you've been doing.
Now hand over the sword or you're dead.
Sasuke!
I'm here!
Well, well, better late than never.
I guess.
So, let's focus on the chakra.
You all right?
Don't just stand there, Sakura.
Chances are this guy's not alone.
Watch out!
You'll know that they're gonna get you now!
I'll use my left hand to stop them.
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Any second now.
I wish I was the only one who was not wrong.
Big mistake.
So much he'll remember. For now.
That proves we have to rely on appearances.
We have to remember that everyone who looks like one of us could use a transformation technique.
All right, so what do we do?
We need a password.
What kind of password?
A secret one. Something that only the three of us know.
And don't trust anyone who doesn't know it.
No matter what.
Okay, listen closely, because I only want to say this once.
The question will be, when does a ninja attack?
And the response is, a ninja is waiting for a comfortable moment when the enemy sleeps and loses his vigilance.
When his weapon lies forgotten in the silence of the night.
That is the moment for a ninja to strike.
Got it?
I got it.
You got one last one? All short?
No, Naruto, that's it.
Come on, what's wrong?
Didn't you get it? I meant it's easy.
Yeah, sure, I got it. I got it, no problem.
I thought it was going to be a password, not a speech.
All right, I'll take it.
Wait a minute, Sasuke!
What was that?
What is it now?
All right, you two hide in the woods and keep your eyes open.
I'll handle this myself.
Sakura!
Sasuke, what was that?
Stay there. First answer to the question, when does a ninja attack?
A ninja is waiting for a comfortable moment when the enemy sleeps and loses his vigilance.
When his weapon lies forgotten in the silence of the night.
That is the moment for a ninja to strike.
Good.
Hey! What's going on? Are you all right?
Hey, don't come any closer!
What's the password?
Oh, sure, no problem.
Okay, a ninja is waiting for a comfortable moment when the enemy sleeps and loses his vigilance.
When his weapon lies forgotten in the silence of the night.
That is the moment for a ninja to strike.
What was that?
Good job, you're quicker than the last one.
What are you talking about? What was wrong with him?
He said the password exactly word for word.
Exactly, that's the problem.
Huh?
You really think Naruto could remember all that?
And get word for word?
Not that Naruto I know.
You'd have a better chance at teaching him to a hamster.
All right, you got the point.
Besides, you saw how he was moving when he tried to attack.
That was different from the attack.
All right, you found your everyone.
Party's over.
Hm-hm.
Odd way to clap along.
Tell me, why did you make up that damn password?
Why would you come up with a password you're not able to remember?
You see, it wasn't meant to be for Naruto.
It was meant for anybody who tried to be near by trying to eavesdrop on us.
It was meant as a trap that you stumbled right into it.
I'm impressed.
You certainly have a lot of experience.
I'm impressed.
You certainly haven't lost your guard, have you?
This promises to be very intimidating.
She can still remember the word cream.
Where is Naruto?
Okay, I'll just be lazy.
Hey, where did Sagura and Sasuke go?
Where did they...
What?
Oh my gosh!
That's...
That's...
That is a big snake!
I can't move!
You'd like to get your hands on our earth scroll, wouldn't you?
It would go so nicely with our heaven scroll.
Well, when this is all over,
one of us will have both scrolls
and the other will be dead.
No!
Is this an illusion?
No, it's not.
Her thirst for blood knows no bounds.
Looking into her eyes,
I saw the moment of her own death.
Who is she?
What is she?
What is she?
Who is she?
What is she?
Sakura?
No use.
She's got worse.
We've got to get out of here.
Get away from her.
She's dead.
Let me out of here!
I'll make you sorry for swallowing me, you smelly bastard!
Let me out of here!
Hey, wait a second.
Here, maybe you'd better take this.
I was saving this for lunch.
It's all gone!
And I'll make you sorry for swallowing me, you smelly bastard!
No! Let me out of here!
Sakura! Sasuke! Save me!
You're paralyzed here.
What's wrong with me?
Move.
Come on, Sasuke, get up.
That's it.
You can do this.
Yes.
That's right.
Even if it's just a little...
You've got to move.
Very well.
Now what happens?
It's no use.
I can't move.
Don't worry, I'll make it quick.
But I don't have to tell you that, do I?
You've seen it with your own eyes.
I expected you to be more of a challenge.
How disappointing.
I can't believe it!
Is this the end?
Iruka-sensei!
Old man Kage!
Konohamaru!
Kakashi-sensei!
Sakura!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
What's wrong?
Well, some that I'm more precious than
others.
I don't know why I didn't like Sasuke.
he was just jealous of me.
Still, there are good moments when we helped
Kakashi beat Zabutzu.
to prove which one of us is best.
Hey, wait a minute, that's right!
We didn't get to have a matchdown!
We never proved who's better!
I want some more!
No way!
I can't just lose in a game like that!
No, I'm getting out of here!
Whether Slippery likes it or not!
So that's how it is.
Oh, Sasuke!
A desperate move, but not a stupid one.
Move, Sasuke!
You've got to move!
You can do it!
Move!
Come on!
Move!
Yes!
He overcame fear with pain.
So this thing is not so helpless after all.
Shadow Clone, you chose the wrong victim!
Sorry, but you've been through a lot, Shingo.
I'm going to be OKAGA in a minute.
You think I'm going to end up a pile of snake crap in the woods?
You're crazy!
The wound is deep.
Will you be all right?
I'm going to be OKAGA in a minute.
Sorry, but you've been through a lot, Shingo.
Will you be all right?
Gotta move!
Gotta get away from here!
But how?
Where?
Man, I've never seen Sasuke like this.
He's got me scared.
Sasuke, watch out!
Unbelievable.
I didn't even notice her.
I think I'm losing.
No!
Stay away!
I sense your fear.
It's only natural.
The prey is never going to come in the dark.
It's never going to come in the dark.
In the presence of its predator.
I'm going to be OKAGA in a minute.
Sorry, but you've been through a lot, Shingo.
I'm going to be OKAGA in a minute.
I think I'm losing.
I'm going to be OKAGA in a minute.
Looks like I came just in time.
Naruto!
Oh, and by the way...
What was that password?
I'm going to be OKAGA in a minute.
Sorry, but you've been through a lot, Shingo.
I'm going to be OKAGA in a minute.

Light was born, darkness was born.
Two are one,
Harmonia,
Telepathy.
Can you hear it?
What a mess!
I turned my back on my team
and scared them away so they couldn't move.
But I'm not afraid of snakes.
I spent an hour in the snakes' pants.
I don't even know what you would do without me.
I don't even know what you would do without me.
I don't even know what you would do without me.
Hey, that's it.
The Reptile Crew is here.
In the next episode, Naruto strikes back.
Not Shingo back.
I don't care who this freak is.
Nobody's scared to show me their tongue.
