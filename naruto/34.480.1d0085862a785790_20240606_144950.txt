Here it is
Naruto
If you open your eyes and get closer
You'll reach it, you'll reach it, you'll reach it
Ah!
Close your eyes and get closer
If it's not a dream, then it doesn't mean anything
So, faraway land
To be continued...
Akamaru is in horror! The power of Gaara is incredible!
Huh?
It's that ninja! Everybody in cover!
Quick, get down! That ninja, where could he be hiding?
Naruto?
Ugh, it's about time for that idiot to wake up.
You really are the only one of the kind to share.
And that means that you're the only one that's playing on my nerves.
Oh no, Sakura! What?
Sakura, Sakura, how are you? What's wrong with your hair?
What happened?
Oh, that's all.
That's all.
I just wanted to just... change my look.
I like it that they're long, but now that so much is happening,
and we're moving around this time, it gets in the way too much.
So what's going on? Where are you guys coming from?
What's going on around here?
I don't have the strength to explain.
Everybody's gathered up to help.
What?
Sakura's pretending that nothing's happened.
Huh?
I'll take care of him now, Ina.
Uh, okay.
Come on, Leap! Stop pretending! Come to your senses, Leap!
Tenten, is that you?
What are you doing here?
I came to help you. What did you think?
What? Where are those sounds coming from?
Sasuke figured it out. Don't worry about it.
Really?
Just why did you come into the fight without us?
Look at what they did to you!
Well, Sakura was in trouble, so I had to do something, right?
He's not kidding!
I couldn't handle the three of them alone.
That was a pretty darn stupid thing to do.
Why did you do it?
Well, I guess you can't argue with that.
Aha! I know you, fatso!
Hey!
Don't you dare speak to Leap in that tone!
What happened when I was off?
Everybody's gone crazy.
Leap!
It looks like Naruto's really gone crazy.
So far he doesn't even know he's gone crazy.
He's not going to do it on his own, is he?
Leap?
Thank you.
Because of you I was able to stand up for myself.
And I've become a little stronger.
Thank you, Sakura.
But my efforts were still not good enough.
So, Sasuke.
You are really good at what they say about you.
Just what you were expected from the Shi clan.
To chase off those ninjas, you must be very strong.
Not like me. I just got beaten up like a pear.
What's he talking about?
He got beaten up like a pear?
Is he serious?
Were those guys really that strong?
Sakura!
The lotus of Leap will bloom twice when we meet again.
When we meet again, I will have become a stronger ninja.
I promise.
Hey, Sakura!
Come on over here!
Come on over here!
I'm going to fix your new hairstyle, okay?
Yeah, I'd like that.
Why, you scoundrel!
Hugging him like this.
Bill Bull is a scoundrel.
In love like at war, all means are fair.
Bill can build a pig.
Sasuke, be quiet.
He's a stronger enemy than I imagined.
Hey, Akamaru, you okay?
Is he still shaking?
He's been at it all day.
Akamaru?
I don't blame him.
Not after what happened,
but after what he saw.
I know who's going to survive this.
Right, Akamaru?
Of course it's lucky that the people got that scrap at an Earthquake.
And we're going to be the first one to win the tower.
Don't get overconfident.
It's a game. It's just a joke.
No matter how small a bug is,
it has to fight itself out.
We have to make sure that we get rid of any enemies.
That's the only way to be safe.
Yeah, I know, Shane.
But as you keep saying,
we have to take a way, you little nerd.
Yeah, Kiba.
What Shane said was right, you know?
Yeah, I know. I just don't like that.
I hope nothing bad happened to the people.
What happened?
Hold on, guys. We should stop.
Why?
We're being... we're not going to encounter any enemies, right?
All right, Hinata.
I want you to go one more meter ahead in that direction.
You're good.
Yakuza!
Yakuza!
There's something there.
It sounds like there are six people there.
All right, let's check it out.
Kiba, what are you talking about?
We're not going to get there.
Why not?
The test to get this through the internet
is going to be full of evidence and evidence, all right?
But she just said we can't do more than that.
If we get more calls from each other,
we're going to go around,
and that means there are fewer competitors in the competition.
But...
First, we'll just check it out, okay?
If it's too dangerous, we're not going to get into a fight.
Now, come on!
Here's the kind of little ugly bug I've never seen before.
What's wrong, Akamaru?
What happened?
You just stopped suddenly.
Yeah, this was so scary.
Yeah, this was so scary.
Yeah, this was so scary.
I have no idea.
Akamaru has no ability
to skip out of the level of Henry's Chakra.
But, again, I've never seen this kind of thing before.
Whoever those ninjas are, they're not normal guys.
They aren't normal guys.
Do you bullies from the village of Sand Mountain
dare to challenge us head on?
Yeah, they're a bunch of fools.
What's he thinking?
That he's way too cool to hang out with,
or that big?
What did you say, Akamaru?
That that big guy
is really in trouble.
They look like they're very bad.
Like they're really, really strong.
Too bad, you guys.
You should have been more considerate
and you're all gonna die.
That's enough of you.
Let's make this quick.
I don't want to waste any more time on them.
We don't even know what kind of scrolls they have.
Hey, Gaara,
doesn't it take more sense to follow these talks
and gather information first?
I mean, if they have the same type of scroll as us,
we're just fighting them.
This is a battle.
I don't care.
They looked at me the other way,
so they're gonna die.
This is why I didn't want to be
starting the war with him.
If you think you can kill us,
then try it.
And now,
Ninja,
come to my store.
A thousand eagles.
Up, down, back,
right, left.
It doesn't matter where you go.
You don't hide from them,
because I control
every single eagle with my chakra.
Shut up, slug!
Is that all you're capable of?
It can't be!
Not a single eagle has passed!
Impossible!
All right.
I have no idea
about the rain and the eagle.
Let's make one about the rain and the eagle.
Man, he has a powerful chakra.
And that's sand.
Do you smell that odor?
It stinks.
What's the odor?
It smells like blood.
He's creating a wall of sand.
That's right.
It's a different thing.
There's nothing going through it.
He carries around all that sand
in the car that he has on his back.
And when he's attacking,
he uses the power of his chakra
to control the heart in the sand.
It's a trick that's only got
to do with Gaara.
It somehow it happens automatically
depending on his will.
So any attack against him
is doomed to fail.
Yeah?
Well, we'll see.
Just face it, you got no chance
of beating Gaara.
Give me a hand.
That guy's dead.
We warned him.
I got him.
Sand!
I can't move!
Let me go!
All I need to do is
cover your mouth with sand
and you're dead.
But it's going to be
too simple and boring.
Sand burial!
Sand burial!
He wasn't in pain.
The sand crushed him with
such force that he died in an instant.
The corpse, the sweat and the tears
of the dead mingled with the sand.
That's feeding the chaos in me.
Just take this little...
Go on!
Yes! Take it!
Just spare us!
No!
Man, this is bad.
We got to get out
before he finds and kills us.
We got lucky.
It's a heaven's scroll.
All right, now let's go to the tower.
Just shut up.
It's not over yet.
It's still not enough for me.
Oh no!
If he did, what's he up for?
Come on, Gaara.
What?
Are you scared, coward?
Look, Gaara,
I know this test is going to be a problem for you,
but it's not for us.
We've already set up two scrolls.
We don't need more for the test.
Losers,
I don't need you.
All right, then.
Sometimes you have to
listen to your older brother.
It's too bad.
But I don't consider you my brother.
If you get in my way,
I'll kill you.
Wait! Just stop, Gaara.
You don't have to treat us
like we're the enemies.
Please, do something for your sister.
Please.
Oh no!
Oh no!
No!
Gaara!
Oh no!
All right,
this time.
Yeah.
That's why I
hate children.
Well, I guess you don't want
to risk your life out.
I just wanted you to meet someone sooner.
No one's here.
We're the first.
No.
I'm sure there was someone here
a long time ago.
I'm very worried about
the Komaru.
The boy was so scared,
he had to go somewhere.
Come to think of it,
what did the Komaru say to you?
Well, I think he was saying
that that bigger ninja was in trouble
because the little kid was gonna kill him.
Just like I thought.
We've already waited half a day.
How much longer
would that make us wait?
I don't know.
I don't know what this war is,
but whatever it is,
I don't want to mess with
is bad news.
This is turning into a real mess.
But there's no way we can
cancel the test.
What do you mean?
Sorry to interrupt.
What do you want?
We're talking about something important.
I'm sorry, but this is tape.
You have to see it.
What is it?
Okay, now when you watch this,
I feel attention to the time.
What does that mean?
That's right, Anka.
This recording was made
inside the tower.
It's unbelievable.
Those ninjas
only passed the test
in two hours and seven minutes.
They complete the record
for passing the second test.
That's impossible.
It took them
just 127 minutes.
Nothing like this has ever happened
in our country.
No one's even close.
The last record
that was set by the ninjas
was four hours.
I'm afraid
it's not just that.
What do you mean?
It's 10 kilometers
from the central gate to the tower
and in between are ferocious
animals and poisonous insects
not to mention the ninjas.
How did they avoid all those things?
Especially that brown-haired kid.
What's so special about him?
You mean you didn't even notice?
Interesting.
That is a big surprise.
I still don't get it.
What am I supposed to notice?
It's what you're not seeing.
Look closely at his body.
I see it now.
Not one single scratch.
And I hear that there's
not one single speck of dirt
on his clothing.
Not even I.
No, not even me.
No, not even me.
No, not even me.
It's impossible.
He must have special abilities.
It's been a long time
since we've had such a promising kid.
But his eyes are
full of evil.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
No way.
No way.
Only thisvalue picks up.
It does.
It's not easy, but you can do it!
It's not easy, but you can do it!
It's not easy, but you can do it!
