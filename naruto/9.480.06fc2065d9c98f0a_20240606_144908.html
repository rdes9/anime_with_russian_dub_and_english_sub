Naruto
We cry for no one, we cry for no one
We cry for no one, we cry for no one
We cry for no one, we cry for no one
Take a deep breath and run through the darkness
Fighting and loving will never end
Moon and Deluxe
You're nothing!
Stop! Stop!
Shadow clone, get down!
Ah, the Shadows are twins, and there's quite a few of them.
The Shadows are twins, and there's quite a few of them.
Here we go!
The Shadows are twins, and there's quite a few of them.
They can't do it together.
He's too strong for them.
I've got something else for you!
Sasuke!
So that was your plan.
Not bad.
Syuriken, Wind Demon, Wind Maiden!
Ah!
Syuriken, you'll never catch me.
So, you're aiming for me, not the clone.
So, you're aiming for me, not the clone.
Smart.
But not this.
A second Syuriken, hidden by the first one.
A second Syuriken, hidden by the first one.
But not this.
A second Syuriken, hidden by the first one.
A second Syuriken, hidden by the second one.
A second Syuriken, hidden by the second one.
The second Syuriken, he's definitely gonna get it.
The second Syuriken, he's definitely gonna get it.
I told you we can't take Syuriken.
He doesn't get me!
He's back!
What?
Eat this!
Kakashi!
Shoryuken Ninja!
Shoryuken Ninja!
Roy, you're finished!
Kakashi-sensei!
Naruto, that was a excellent plan.
You've really grown up, haven't you?
I knew I couldn't get a clone, but that was a success, right?
Well, he thought I turned into a Shoryuken ghost.
He didn't know what that was.
I used one of the clones in the first school I saw, Shoryuken.
All right, balance is...?)
Representation.
When I threw it to Sasuke, it was like a real shuriken.
Sasuke!
Sasuke immediately realized that it was me.
He spun around so that no one could see him, and pulled out his own shuriken.
Now there were two shurikens.
One was real, one was fake.
One was fake.
One was fake.
One was fake.
One was fake.
One was real, one was fake.
Shuriken! Windmill!
Windmill!
I hid in the shower with a real shuriken and I followed the real Zabuzei.
Of course I wouldn't have found him myself.
That was when the case went.
It was important to me to get him out of water prison.
I didn't think that his clone would get him too.
That's the point! Leave it!
Don't f**k with me. You just went down.
The whole thing was just a coincidence.
You can f**k with us.
Our teamwork is flawless.
They knew what to do.
They knew what to say.
Most of the time they hate each other.
We just said, we're a team.
I got distracted.
I lost my grip on what to do.
Don't flatter yourself.
You weren't disciplined.
You were forced to let go.
Let go.
You take what's yours.
But it won't work for you anymore.
So, what's it gonna be?
What's next?
Sakura, do you know what to do?
Yes.
He hotel is under siege!
That's right.
The Shining Biohazard
You have to beおお
You have to put him down
He's our planet,
I am a fox, I am a fox, I am a fox, I am a fox, I am a fox, I am a fox, I am a fox, I am a fox, I am a fox, I am a fox, I am a fox, I am a fox, I am a fox, I am a fox, I am a fox, I am a fox, I am a fox, I am a fox, I am a fox, I am a fox, I am a fox, I am a fox, I am a fox, I am a fox, I am a fox, I am a fox, I am a fox, I am a fox, I am a fox, I am a fox, I am a fox, I am a fox, I am a fox, I am a fox, I am a fox, I am a fox, I am a fox, I am a fox, I am a fox, I am a fox, I am a fox, I am a fox, I am a fox, I am a fox, I am a
fox, I am a fox, I am a fox, I am a fox, I am a fox, I am a fox.
Ah...
Arggghhh...
watery...
Man, it is this exact repeat of what you were talking about.
Mister mindless...
What are they doing?
It's not Ijutsu!
Something is wrong.
Sharingan can comprehend and copy the enemy's moves.
However...
Torii!
Water style! Water style!
Ijutsu! Water Dragon!
Both Ijutsu have appeared at the same time.
Maybe...
To be continued...
Could it be...
Ah...
He's not just copying.
He moves the same way at the same time.
How's he doing that?
Sasuke!
My man...
It's as if...
It's as if he knows what he's going to do next.
What are you going to do next?
What?
Is he reading minds?
This look...
This Sharingan...
It makes you feel pissed, doesn't it?
All you're doing is copying me like a monkey.
You can't do this to me, Triss.
I'll crush you.
When I crush you, I'll never be a monkey again.
What is it?
It's...
It's me.
But how?
Is it his own hallucination?
Water style!
Ijutsu Vodovoroto!
What?
What?
It can't be!
I was going to do a Vodovoroto, but he's ahead of me.
He comes before I do.
I can't make it!
I can't make it!
You're finished with him.
How?
Can you see a future?
Yes.
This is your last battle ever.
You were right.
It was his last battle.
I can't make it!
No signs of life.
Thank you.
Dza Budza.
I've been tracking him for a long time.
I've been waiting for the chance to finally take him down.
By your mask, I see that you're a spy from the village hidden in the mist.
Impressive.
You're well informed.
A tracker!
Wait, Naruto.
You don't know what that is.
You missed the lesson on the mission.
Trackers have a special role.
The trackers on the Senobi, when they go away from the village,
they carry all the secrets of the village.
The trackers are specially trained to hunt down the hidden and eliminated.
That way, the secrets of the village can be discovered.
That way, the secrets of their people remain secrets.
That's correct.
I'm a member of the elite tracking unit of the village hidden in the mist.
It was my duty to stop Dza Budza.
Judging by his voice, he must be the same age as Naruto.
Yet he's an experienced assassin.
He's not just a kid.
But what is he?
What is it?
Who do you think you are?
Did you hear me?
Easy, Naruto.
He's not our enemy.
That's not the point.
You see what he did just for that?
That was huge!
Dza Budza is huge, as strong as a beast.
And this kid, he's just a kid.
He's just a kid.
What are we then?
We're just not able to do anything.
We don't know anything.
How can I accept that?
Well, it doesn't matter if you don't understand or not.
Still, that's not the point.
There are kids who are younger than you,
but they're stronger than me.
The battle is over.
I'll take care of the rest.
Even his body keeps secrets.
Nobody should know about them.
Please excuse me.
Farewell.
He just disappeared!
He just disappeared!
He just disappeared!
He just disappeared!
He just disappeared!
He's gone, Naruto.
Let it go.
What are we doing here?
We're nothing!
I can't believe it!
Naruto!
Naruto!
We're ninjas,
and it's not easy to do what we need to do.
Don't waste your energy.
You'll need it later.
We haven't completed our mission yet.
We still have to get the bridge builder to his bridge.
Sorry it's all because of me.
You can rest in my house when we get to the village.
All right.
Get on the move.
What? What happened?
Kakashi-sensei!
Kakashi-sensei!
Kakashi-sensei!
Kakashi-sensei!
What are we doing?
We're out of control!
Kakashi-sensei!
Kakashi-sensei!
Kakashi-sensei!
Kakashi-sensei!
We can't fight them alone!
We have to train!
Kakashi-sensei!
Kakashi-sensei!
Kakashi-sensei!
Kakashi-sensei!
We can't fight them alone. We need to train, become stronger.
Why climb trees now?
Well, if Kakashi said I needed to work...
In the next episode, I'll be kicking butt again!
Fact!
I'll be kicking butt again!
You'll see it!
