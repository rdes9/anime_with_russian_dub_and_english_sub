        <pre>NARUTO
We cry for no one, we cry for no one
Our present is
Painful solitude, heart solitude, shadow solitude
Our breath is cold, we run through the darkness
Fighting and loving will never end
All the way
Painful solitude, heart solitude, shadow solitude
We cry for no one, we cry for no one
And so I started to catch up with you in time
My movements...
It can't be!
Damn! Just a little bit more!
Naruto, can you go on?
Just a little bit more! I'm totally fine!
He's pretty tired.
And it's not in vain, because the technique of shadow clones requires a lot of chakras.
But thanks to that I found...
His weak spot.
It can't be!
It's just a coincidence.
Naruto, run!
Get out of here and attack from the outside!
Got it!
Do you think you can do it?
I won't back down!
Here he is! Kato! Gokkakyo Natsutsu!
Damn!
Damn!
That was okay.
Let's try it one more time.
Got it!
I guess this guy's chakras have limits too.
Every time a little bit.
I won't act like you thought.
I'll start with you!
Sasuke!
Damn!
I haven't had a fight in such dangerous conditions for a long time.
Besides, I'm worried about Sasuke and Naruto.
Be cool.
Think.
Where is he going now?
He's not here.
Too late.
Free seal!
That was...
...Sakura's voice.
Something must have happened.
What is this Kakashi doing there?
Sakuratian!
Damn, we have to do this.
We'll make it somehow.
Him?
Well, I'm going.
Useless fight.
Naruto, behind you!
Naruto!
It's impossible to escape from here.
Absolutely.
Can you stand up, Naruto?
I won't use the chakra in vain anymore.
He's just waiting for this.
Yeah.
I got it.
Damn, if we keep going like this, we're stuck.
I have to do something.
Something happened to my eyes.
Well, let's finish it gradually.
What?
Stand up, you idiot!
I've marked important organs in my life.
But all the attacks were repulsed.
I know without you!
I'm so tired of you!
Coincidence?
No, not at all.
No.
Most likely it's because he's defending...
He's fighting, defending his friend.
Could it be...
My movements?
This boy sees something?
I wonder what.
Okay, if so.
He disappeared.
Where?
Where did he go?
Naruto, don't lose consciousness anymore.
Otherwise I won't be able to cover you.
Who are you?
Well, it seems this little one has exceeded his limit.
Excellent.
Great movement.
You're moving well.
But now I'll stop you.
The ability to move, the defensive reflexes, the ability to assess the situation.
All this has already reached its limit in you.
Here he is.
Calm down.
Calm down.
Concentrate.
Concentrate.
I completely predicted it.
Really?
These eyes...
It can't be Sirengan.
You...
Although not much,
but I saw it.
That's it.
That's it.
That's it.
That's it.
That's it.
So you also have the power to pass on inheritance.
What kind of children are they?
They are not yet taught, but during the fight they wake up like that.
But I can't fight for so long.
This technique takes away a lot of chakras.
In order to accumulate speed for movement, there is also a limit.
I'm afraid that the longer this fight lasts, the more he can read my movements.
His eyes have already captured me.
It's stupid to attack him directly.
Then...
I'm using this guy.
I can lure him.
What?
We don't have time.
Kakashi-sensei!
You're late with the defense, aren't you, Kakashi?
The fog has clouded your Sirengan, and the thought of saving the children is your mind.
Despite the fact that you have such an eye,
your power in reading the opponent's movements has become dull.
Well, entertain me more, Kakashi.
I would like to return the debt to you with pleasure.
And you don't worry.
Haku will soon finish your little ones.
At least in that world you can ask them for forgiveness for being so weak.
Haku!
Sasuke-kun will lose!
It can't be!
Sasuke-kun!
Damn it!
That bastard!
Damn it!
He'll never give up!
Damn it!
And Naruto too!
That's right.
I believe in their power.
Naruto is the greatest, most unpredictable, noisy ninja number one.
And Sasuke belongs to the most outstanding clan in the village of Konoha.
It can't be!
That's right. His name is Uchiha Sasuke.
A genius ninja, in whose body the blood of this clan flows.
The only living representative of that tragically famous family?
That's why he's improving so fast.
But the same can be said about Haku.
There is no one who could resist this secret technique of Haku.
Well, I guess I'll be finishing soon.
Sakura, don't take a step out of this place.
No, I'll be finishing this.
Take a look at yourself.
You always turn out to be a bully.
You did it, Sasuke!
What? What's that face?
You're a bully.
Why?
You saved me.
How do I know?
How do I know?
I'll become Hokage, and the whole village will recognize me.
What, scared like a kitten?
We've reached the top.
Sasuke! Sasuke! Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
I've always hated you.
Why? Why? Why? Why me?
I didn't ask you to help me!
How do I know?
The body moved on its own.
Idiot.
Sasuke!
That man...
My brother...
He said he wouldn't die...
Until I kill him.
But I...
Died.
He...
In order to protect my dear man,
he was able to die knowing about her in advance.
He is a shinobi who deserves respect.
This is the first time your friend dies.
This is the shinobi's path.
Shut up!
I'll kill you, too!
I hated you, too!
I won't forgive you!
I'll finish you right now!
What kind of chakra is this?
It can't be...
That the fate of the world is in my hands.
It can't be...
That the essence of the chakra has changed.
Besides, such a disgusting chakra...
The wounds on his hands heal right in the eyes.
What kind of child is this?
Is this Zabuza?
No.
Such an evil chakra.
I'll kill you!
I'll kill you!
I'll kill you!
I'll kill you!
I'll kill you!
I'll kill you!
I'll kill you!
Such an evil chakra.
Really?
What kind of chakra is this?
I have a bad feeling.
Kakashi?
For Kakashi, she is too big.
Who is it then?
Doruto?
What does it mean?
Such a moment...
Is his seal destroyed?
We need to hurry!
We need to hurry!
Not right for you!
But he is too shaken, like I was 12 Sneaking out the classroom, by the back door
