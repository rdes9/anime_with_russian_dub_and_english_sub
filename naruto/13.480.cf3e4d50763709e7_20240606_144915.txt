Dumbass
Naruto
Our present
Untie the pain, untie the heart, untie the shadow
Breathe in, run through the darkness
Fighting and loving each other
The end is unknown
All the way
I wanna rocks
Rocks on my chest
Inari, help me, please
I'm coming
This is Duman
Sasuke, Sakura
Here they are
So he survived
And immediately after us
Kakashi-sensei, this is the technique, isn't it?
The technique of hiding in the fog
Sorry for making you wait, Kakashi
And you still hang out with these kids
Look, they're shaking again, poor things
Naruto
This is my military dust
Do it, Sasuke
I see
I see
He was able to see the water clones
And this paint is noticeably grown
Looks like you have an opponent, isn't it, Haku?
Looks like it
The End
Damn it!
I'm definitely late
It seems that my assumptions got to the point
Your assumptions?
About that little boy in the mask
Yeah, that's what I thought
So it was just an impudent lie
About the following ninja from the village hidden in the fog
It was clearly Zabuze's friend
Who's been following us for five years
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
He's been following us for five years
And he still has the audacity to show up after what he's done
I don't like such rare jokes at all
But it's still better than Kakashi-sensei
That's right
Leave him to me
He played that cheap show
I hate such rare bastards most of all in the world
Sasuke, you're so cool!
You can't get close to Sasuke
And don't hope, Sakura
He's an impressive guy
Despite the fact that the water clones have only a tenth of the power of the original
I didn't think he'd be able to handle them
But we made the first move
Go
Yes
What?
Haku's secret technique
Earth Mirror from crystal to ice
Is that you, Tatsuna's daughter?
Of course you're sorry, but you'll have to come with us
Mom!
Don't hide!
Run away from here!
What do you want, kid?
We'll take him with us
It's better if there's only one hostage
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
It's better if there's only one hostage
A hostage?
Well
Cool, then
Should we kill him?
Wait!
Just raise your hand at this kid
And I'll bite off my tongue and die!
You need a hostage, don't you?
Be grateful to your mom, kid
I'm missing something
Stop it
Hey, calm down
You've just been practicing in prison
You'd better take the girl and let's get out of here
Mom, I'm sorry
I'm sorry, please
I'm weak, so I can't protect you
Mom, I'm sorry
I'm weak, so I can't protect you
I don't want to die
I'm scared
You're a crybaby
You're crying like an actor on stage
Only fools like you can cry all the time
Crybaby!
I think he's tired of crying
That's why he understood what it means to be strong
Just like your father
You have to protect what's really important to you with both hands
Even if it costs you your life
Inari
Inari
I'm curious
Will I ever be strong too?
Dad!
When I look at your beautiful skin, I want to cut it
Come on, walk faster
Stop!
Inari!
What is it?
Is it that guy again?
My mom's brooch!
Well, it looks like you can't do anything with him
I'll deal with him
Do it, and I'll...
Shut up and sleep
Inari!
He can see that speed
What speed?
Sakura, stand next to Tatsuno-san and stay away from him
We'll leave him to Sasuke
I don't want to kill you, but you won't back down, right?
Don't pretend to be a fool
That's what I thought
You won't be able to catch up with my speed
Besides, I have two advantages
Two advantages?
The first is the water around you
And the second is that I took one of your hands
Now you can only defend yourself from my attacks with one hand
What?
With one hand?
With one hand?
I've never seen anything like that
Secret technique
A thousand deadly moves
So you don't want to kill me?
I didn't hear you
Sasuke!
Remember that training
Activate the chakra immediately
Body replacement technique, woman?
Sorry for being late
But heroes are characters that appear at the last moment
Brother Naruto
Inari!
You did a good job
You distracted these guys, and that's why I managed to save your mom
You're a bitch
Did you find out that these samurai came here?
There was a katana boar cut out of the woods
There was also a lot of trees, everything else with traces of katana
That's what I said
And go home to Inari
I was concerned about that
What's that?
This is some kind of useless ninja that Tadzun hired.
Let's finish him off.
Yes.
They're coming!
Will it help?
Fool!
Get ready!
Wow!
Cool!
Awesome!
Naruto, brother!
You're just like a ninja!
Fool! I am a real ninja!
Chakra, I'm going to activate the Chakra!
On your feet!
On your feet!
It's gone.
It's gone.
That was unexpected.
From now on, you will only defend yourself from my attacks.
You want me to lose to Haku in speed?
It doesn't matter, but it looks like I'm winning in speed.
It looks like you underestimated my squad, calling them kids.
Asasuke is the best ninja in the village of Anoha.
And Sakura is the most beautiful.
Of course!
And one more.
This is the most eye-catching, unpredictable, noisy ninja number one, Naruto.
Are you cold?
No, I'm fine.
By the way, Inari...
I'm sorry about yesterday.
It was what I called you a ploxy worm.
Forget about it.
You're strong.
Damn it, I thought I wouldn't cry anymore.
Now Naruto will call me a ploxy again and consider me stupid.
What are you talking about?
Everything is fine.
These are tears of joy.
When a person is happy, you can cry.
Brother!
So, will you handle it yourself now?
Yes.
Then I'll go to the bridge.
It's not easy to be a hero after all.
Yes, it's not easy.
Haku, do you understand that we will have to leave because of such actions?
Yes.
What is it?
I'm very sorry.
Is this...
...cold?
Secret technique.
What kind of technique is this?
What kind of technique is this?
What kind of technique is this?
These...
...mirrors.
What are they?
Damn it!
Your opponent is me, isn't it?
Thanks to this technique, your guy is over.
Well, I'll start slowly.
I'll show you my real speed.
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
One unthinkable move and I'll finish those two.
Tatsuno-san, I'm sorry.
I'll leave you for a while.
Got it.
Go.
Sakura!
Sasuke-kun!
Catch!
S.T.A.R.S.E.
That's enough!
Who's that?
That's a bugger.
It's a jump.
Unthinkable number one.
A noisy ninja.
Utsumaki Naruto, we're at last!
Cultivate your hunger, before you idealize
Motivate your anger, to make them all realize
Climbing the mountain, never coming down
Breaking through the contents, never falling down
The knee is too shaken, like I was 12
Sneaking out the classroom, by the back door
A man ran at me twice home, but I didn't care
Waiting is wasting, for people like me
Don't try to love so wise
Don't cry that you're so wise
Don't try to spend so fast
Cause you will hate yourself in the end
Don't try to love so wise
Don't cry cause you're so right
Don't try with fake so fierce
Cause you will hate yourself in the end
Don't try to love so wise
Don't cry cause you're so right
Don't try...
Wait...
Why can't I break the mirror made of ice?
Why can't I melt?
What the hell is going on with me?
Next episode!
The alien number one, Naruto 3000!
Will I be able to perform again?
