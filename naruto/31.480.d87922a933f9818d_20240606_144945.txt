Gently, gently, I'll pull you in with my left hand
I'm sure it will reach you, I'm sure it will reach you
Ah
I'm close to you, I'm holding you
I'm sure it will reach you, I'm sure it will reach you
I'm sure it will reach you, I'm holding you
If it's not a dream, there's no point
I'm far away
Don't tell me you've come here to kill Hokage?
No, not yet
I don't have enough help to do that
But I've heard a lot of good things about this village
I might want to make a money
Oh, it's the mark, isn't it?
I put that similar small friend of mine
Just a little iron man
Very promising project
And you don't believe what I say?
He'll die before he tries to
He'll die before he tries to
Very likely
I'd say the chances are between 10 and 10
But the kid may survive, as you did
Sounds like he's very badly
Oh, jealous, is that it?
You can't even get it for using me for tossing yourself
In some ways, the boy has even more potential than you have
You see, he's inherited the high art of the Uchiha clan
And his physical condition is excellent
Yes, he might very well be the ideal weapon
At the very least, it's not so interesting
Whatever happens, make sure no one steps out of the test before time
Three of my three candidates are participating in it
I look forward to seeing what they can do
Bear this in mind
If anything happens to drive me and my family
You will end belief in me
All right, that's enough resting, that's enough
The other teams will be probably the first in line
And that means it's time to strike
You know the plan
We split up and fan out
Whatever happens, whether we make contact with another team
We meet up back here in this spot
Got it
No sweat, Roger
Roger, Roger, Roger
No sweat, Roger
All right then
Let's move
Bushibao's pledge
Undaunted love and protection
Wasui
I can't fall asleep
I have to protect them
Oh wow, I slept really well
I'm so happy
Oh wow, I slept really well
Hey, Naruto
Sasuke
Did you take care of us all this time, Toya?
Thanks, Sakura
You brought us back to life
I'm glad you're okay
Now you will see what it means to be a prey
Panicking and suddenly running away from the predator
And that predator is Mia
My voice is gone
Our voice is gone
It was just a dream
I can't believe it's daytime already
Oh no
A squirrel?
Oh man, don't surprise me like that, little guy
That was too close
I thought Fisher had the mirror
Do you think she saw the paper bomb on the squirrel?
No, that wasn't it
Then what was it?
What are you thinking?
I'm thinking we need to get a little closer and find out
So let's get going
Okay, if I can get all 20 leaves before they hit the ground
Sakura will fall in love with me
But if I can't, then she will never return my feelings
That is the challenge I'm going to give myself
Those eyebrows are so cute
I'm going to get them back
I'm going to get them back
I'm going to get them back
I'm going to get them back
I'm going to get them back
Those eyebrows are so cute
You're such a weirdo
I can't believe she said that
I swear I'm going to get them back
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight
Yes, I'm going to get them all
Nineteen
One left
What is that?
That was close
This paper bomb explodes after a certain amount of time
Who would do such an awful thing?
All right, stop hiding in the mouse
Shoot!
How could he have seen us, kid?
What a drag
Nothing is found out, this is going to be such a pain
It's no big deal
But our hidden heyday is that it didn't work
So, it's just your strategy number two
What? Are you so stupid?
You got to fumble with that
Trust me, this plan can't fail
Well, what do we have to lose?
Wow, and Nedji's a newbie from last year's summer
I'm looking to be a future
Can I have your autograph, Dash?
Oh, it's you guys
Yeah, it's strategy two
When you fall, I never feel the love of my life
Hi there
I've been wanting to meet you for a really long time, Nedji
So, hi
Get lost
What?
He shouldn't be able to look at my beauty
Why did that work?
Ugh, it makes me feel like they're the steps that I took
Did you just raise your fist at me?
Does that call for a fight?
No
No way
Of course not
Go away
Even if I were to steal a scroll from you cowardly winks
Everybody would just laugh at me for it
Sounds to me
They scurry off like cockroaches
Just as I thought
Someone like him won't take a scroll from people like us
Unless we do not provoke them
Oh, right
Let's see if we can find the weaklings
Yeah, well, some doubt that there are any weaker than us
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Some look at her half a second
At least you don't need to watch anymore
What's the point of being able to be found?
Now, wake Sasuke up
We want to fight him
You never get him, you jerks
What do you want here?
I mean, what do you really want?
I know you're only a doll in the hands of Aradimaru
What's that strange blue thing on Sasuke's neck?
You're behind this, aren't you?
And now you want to fight the one who can't defend himself?
I wonder what he's thinking
I can't stay quiet over here
Your tone doesn't like that
First I'm gonna kill this girl
And then I'm gonna kill Sasuke
Wait, son
What? Why?
It's so obvious
This is the color of the dirt that's been dug up recently
And this kind of grass doesn't grow in places like this
You know, if you're built to have a life of your own
I think this makes you actually hidden
Ha! You're just chillin' through your good nights
So that's why I'm gonna screw in the trap you set, huh?
Now, we kill her
A log!
She also put a trap on top of it
Watch out
Nice fly, little girl
Clearly you don't look like there's a ninja
Someone might need to make a lot of work for you if you don't think
Deep party!
What?
Is that you again?
Looks like you also need to make more of an effort
Who are you?
I am the action devil of the village
And my name is Rock Lee
What are you doing here, Lee?
I will always appear anytime, anywhere you are in trouble, Sakura
This was really all that means to you, little one
But now it is time for you to run along
But right now, on this test, I'm your enemy
Sakura, I already told you
I will protect you until I die
Please be my girlfriend
I vow to protect you with my life
Yes
Thank you, Rock Lee
Yes! She said yes!
I said yes!
She said yes!
It looks like I have no choice
Zaku, I'll let you take care of Sasuke
I'll take care of these two
It is not likely that Sakura is the only person to fight
That guy with the blue eyes is a good guy
He looks like a good guy
Looks like a good guy
I am positive there's some kind of trick to your attack
They're pure
I will not take your time trying to dodge it
After all, I've seen your jukes before
Wow, he's so brave
Of course, it's not going to be easy
There's three of them at once, but I have to take the risk
One at a time
I will attack this system with all my might
Oh, man!
We're probably the weakest team
Not so bad
I still think Naruto's team is weaker than we are
Take that back!
What do you mean?
Naruto and Sakura are weak, but I won't let you mess with Sasuke
He's the best!
Yeah, whatever
Maybe your precious Sasuke is better in theory than in practice
All right, all right
I apologize if I upset you
What a drag
I say one more negative thing about Sasuke
and I think you can find for yourself what I'm saying here
There is no way Sasuke could lose a battle
Sakura is a different matter
Hey, Sasuke is lying there
Sasuke has no feelings
And Sakura is fighting
What did you say?
He's late
And he's never...
Lee is... well, fanatical about being on time
Maybe he ran into enemy
You think?
No, I'm sure he's all right
But still, we better go find him
Right
Yes! I did it! I finally got this Zutsu!
Remember, there's nothing impossible in youth
This tricks, in the end, will lead to Lee
I did it! I actually did it!
Lee
That's what I'm best at
Lee
No one even thought that...
Lee
I'll make it, but I did it!
Quiet!
Now listen to your sensei's posture, sensei
I am ready to hear your wise words, sir
This new Zutsu, the Lotus Technique, is now forbidden to use
What do you mean? Why?
This Zutsu, it puts a huge strain on your body's muscle
It's a self-sacrifice you take
Normally, humans overuse at most 20% of their muscles
Do you understand? Only about 20%
If all of the power were used to use the muscles, they would disintegrate
So the brain regulates the amount of power muscles can use it
But this Zutsu is different
It uses this chakra, which forces the brain to go past its limits
Allowing a human to be as high speed as possible
In other words, this Zutsu is based on a secret technique
That brings more power almost beyond the human body
So you see, it's very dangerous
There's one time this Zutsu can be used for a particular condition, isn't there?
Yes, I see! So what is the condition, sir?
Are you ready?
You all need to take this to the point
The condition is...
The condition is...
Gai-sensei, I have to use the Lotus now
The condition has been met
I must use the Zutsu
To protect the life of someone precious
Did he disappear?
Not today!
Oh, no, Dotsu!
There's no way you can break the wall!
Take this!
Ready for the Lotus technique!
What is this?
Got you just in time
That impulse
Got you just in time
That impulse could have been much worse
What? This cannot be!
That is a strong Zutsu
If it wasn't for that pile of dirt, I wouldn't have survived
Now it's my turn
Oh, no! My body has not recovered from the Zutsu!
Blin, no!
Your technique is impressive
But ours is faster
Because it travels with the speed of sound
Effort by itself is nothing
Now watch, we're going to show you what real art is
What is this?
What is this?
What is this?
What is this?
What is this?
What is this?
What is this?
What is this?
What is this?
What is this?
What is this?
What is this?
What is this?
What is this?
What is this?

What is this?

What is this?
What is this?
What is this?
What is this?
What is this?
I'm so sick of this, it's like I'm always the weakest of all, and I'm always going to be protected.
I want to be like Sasuke, Naruto, or Rock Lee.
Wait, did I just say I want to be like Naruto?
Well, at least he didn't hesitate to jump into the action.
So yeah, I want to be like Naruto.
Next time, Sakura Blast!
In this battle, things will be different.
In this battle, things will be different.
In this battle, things will be different.
