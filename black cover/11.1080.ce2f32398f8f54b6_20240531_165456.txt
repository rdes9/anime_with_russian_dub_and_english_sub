It seemed that humanity would be destroyed by demons, but one mage was able to save this world.
He was given the title of King of the Magi, and he became a legend.
Well, how? You've just been done! Misha of creation!
Well, what? I ate!
You!
What kind of man is he after all?
Hey, you bastards!
Is my magic sealed?
The knights of the sorcerers will untie you with mega tongues!
Who are you, what did you want, how cute you will put it all out!
You won't make it. It seems that this is the end.
The magic of the ice, the ice cellar.
He was sure that someone was so strong.
Idiots, life, what is life for you?

You are so lively.
Why is he so happy? After all, people died.
Captain, I don't think that we can laugh about it.
You won't bring back the tears of the old man.
Right?
Yes, Mr. Yami.
The old man liked it when everyone around him was cheerful and happy.
Come on, guys, laugh too.
Come on.
Louder.
Not you, Noel.
It's okay.
What happened in Seychelles is really terrible.
But the three of you were able to protect the inhabitants.
Be proud of it.
Well, okay, you worked hard for fame, fool.
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
What is it?
Idiot!
Don't you know how to give honor to a knight?
Look here.
These fingers symbolize cleverness.
Well, try it.
Yes, sir!
Great!
We're back.
The three of you did a good job.
Vanessa? Finral?
Captain, we were in the magic investigation committee.
Okay.
Did they find anything?
Who's behind all this?
I'll find their base and spread it to the devils.
I'll shake them all out.
Well, they...
They were investigating the item that the magician left behind.
But they didn't find anything.
What good is it for them?
Idiots, enough.
We're going to destroy everything here.
I'm sorry.
Well, these pocket watches are pretty beautiful.
Yes, judging by the behavior of the attackers,
they all had a fairly high status.
So it's either the royal family or the noblemen.
Oh, what kind of bird is this? How cute!
Where is she, she's cute!
She's cute!
Hey, you!
Come on, fly to me!
Little ugly bird, I'll burn you!
Just try it!
You can already pray!
Don't you dare!
Again, you're destroying everything here!
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
But you're the one who's destroying everything here.
Okay, now listen.
It doesn't matter who's behind all this, the noblemen or the noblemen.
We're going to leave it to the Magical Investigative Committee
and we're going to wait for the report.
And by the way, I have good news for you.
Good news?
Interesting.
Of course!
Your actions were recognized by the king of the magicians himself.
The king of the magicians?
He awarded you with a star.
Wow, really?
Yeah!
Great!
Yeah!
Wow!
That's cool!
Congratulations!
What kind of star is this?
Don't be so happy when you don't know what it is.
Stars are given to the king of the magicians for their work.
And why do they need them?
Well, it's a sign of honor.
Honor?
Right, Asta, honor.
A sign of honor for men.
There's a lady here.
A sign of honor for men and women.
That's ridiculous.
The knights of the magicians compete to see who gets the most stars.
Their number shows how much work the squad has done.
Oh, now I get it.
By the way, the first place is the Golden Dawn.
They have 70 stars.
70?
What about us?
How many black bulls do we have?
We're not going to lose to them.
We do.
That's exactly minus 30.
Minus?
What?
Now there's only a hundred left until the Golden Dawn.
A hundred?
Well, in order to catch up and overtake them, we're going to lose eternity.
Damn it, young man.
Impossible.
Do I have to be in this squad?
And one more.
Your salary for the month.
Huh?
Ah!
Money!
There are about 200,000 jules here.
Thank you.
Thank you, captain.
With this, I can buy so many delicious things.
Of course.
Hey, captain, how much should I fight you?
Well, well.
Not much.
Well, captain.
I thought I'd buy new clothes for my angel, the younger sister, Marie,
so that she would look better on her.
Don't ask me.
That's it.
I have no idea.
Tomorrow is your day off.
Don't waste it in vain.
I have a lot of dates planned.
Do what you want.
Thank you very much.
Thank you for everything, captain.
We should all go somewhere together and have some fun.
What do you think?
A trifle.
Are you stupid?
You can buy potatoes for them for 10 years.
Potatoes?
What is it?
Potatoes from the ancient Heich have a very delicate taste and a dubious texture.
Garbage.
Not garbage at all.
Sister Lily can cook anything delicious from it.
Who is it?
A woman I'm going to marry.
What?
But aren't sisters nuns?
I don't think they can get along.
It's not a problem.
I can overcome the limitations.
Are you stupid?
Congratulations on your first salary.
What are you going to spend it on?
I haven't decided yet.
What about you, baby?
I was going to send some money to the Heige church.
Great idea, Asta.
A real man's action.
Yeah, and you're sending your money to your homeland too.
Of course, but...
But?
Only when I win a hundred times more.
Life doesn't teach you anything.
Man, you have to take risks.
You probably wanted to say morons.
Well, you're not going to send all the money there, are you?
Leave a little for yourself.
Leave?
But what am I going to spend it on?
What about going to the benches of the castle city tomorrow?
And you too?
Please come back.
I'll see you out.
Oh.
How are you, sister Lily?
I'm fine.
All the seniors in the squad are kind to me.
Asta, come here.
What are we doing?
Don't move.
Fire magic!
Explosive...
Fire...
...ball!
It's burning! It's burning! It's burning! It's burning! It's burning!
I said, don't move!
I can't!
Besides, I did well with my first assignment,
and the King of the Magi has awarded me with a star for my excellent work.
With this pace, I'll be able to become the King of the Magi in the next month.
I'll become them and create a world where every person will be happy.
And when I come back to you, please come out for me.
I just got my first salary, so I'll send you money.
Done. I'm sure this is a great letter.
I wonder if Sister Lily will be upset.
The King of the Magi. The King of the Magi.
I wonder what he's like.
Black Clever
Have you ever been to a castle town?
No, I haven't.
I think the noblemen of the Magi have enough reasons to not go there often.
What about you?
I was there when I took the entrance exam in The Knight of the Magi.
Well, let's have some fun.
Hey, don't touch me.
I can't. Do you want me to fall?
For some reason, I can't stop thinking about him. Damn it.
What? Again?
Clever Kingdom is divided into noble lands where members of the royal family live to know,
common lands where ordinary people live, and abandoned lands where peasants live.
The royal city of Kiko, where the noblemen and young people passed the test is located in common lands.
It's amazing.
It's pretty lively.
I hope I'll be able to bring my sister, Lily, and the children from the church here one day.
Marie, my goddess.
I'm already flying to you.
I want to see your smile as soon as possible.
I can't wait.
Mister.
That voice.
So you're back.
Yes.
I won't lose this month.
Me too.
I'm going to the church.
I'm going to the church.
I'm going to the church.
I'm going to the church.
I'm going to the church.
I don't want to lose.
Me neither.
A super portion of everything.
Try to eat all this.
Thanks for the food.
Mo cream, Mo cream, Mo cream, Mo cream, Mo cream, Mo cream, Mo cream, Mo cream, Mo cream.
I'm limite hot because of one of those.
Oh?
Miss, we're a bit late.
Would you like to get a cup of tea with me?
Can't you see that I have time?
You can take your kids with you.
I know a great...
Why did you decide that they're mine?
They're my brothers and sisters.
I need to get home to open the store.
I don't have time for that.
Oh my God.
I love rude girls.
Miss,
would you like to have some fun?
Hey, boy, don't get carried away.
I'm so hungry.
Don't you want to buy something?
There are so many things here,
and I don't even know what to choose.
I don't know.
Hey,
those clothes,
they're knight's charms.
That's a sign.
Those are black beaks.
That's
Vanessa, the hot witch.
There's a cutie next to her,
and that kid is also made of black beaks.
It's better to stay away from them.
It's getting noisy.
Relax.
With knight's charms,
no one will dare to commit a crime.
Not to mention that on the way,
we can hook up a couple of three beauties.
Well, let's see.
I bought some healing herbs
and a potion that acts as a antidote.
That should be enough.
Since we've already bought everything we need,
why don't we go to a quieter place?
A quieter place?
I know one.
This way.
This way?
Isn't that a alley?
Isn't that a dead end?
Isn't that a dead end?
Come on.
Wow!
That's a black market.
A black market?
It's a little bit dangerous,
but it's full of
useful things.
Hey, Vanessa.
Look, I've got a new item.
Hi.
I'll come later.
Wow!
It doesn't look like you're excited.
No.
There's nothing to blame you for.
The nobles have a lot of prejudices
about such places.
But you still can't control
your magic, can you?
Yes.
What is it?
There are items that
will help you with that.
If you can find
an item that suits you,
it will adjust your magic
and it will be easier for you to control it.
Control my powers?
Why don't we take a look?
Of course.
It's so cold in here.
You're still too young
for such places.
It's better for the nobles
to wear their noses,
or you'll regret it all your life.
Great!
I'll do it!
I'll increase my salary
a hundredfold!
I know it!
Damn!
I failed again.
I see the future.
This old lady is not a failure.
Anyway,
it's enough to cool down here.
I have a job.
The job of a pocket watchman.
Is this what a wizard knight
should do?
But the captain will be
terribly angry if I refuse.
Do you have any problems?
I'll cut you into two.
Even though I was able to
join the wizard knight,
that green moth...
I'm a moth.
Now I'm fucking a bug.
I have one routine every day.
And on a regular mission
I was a shield,
and I almost died.
The locks were tortured,
the hair fell out.
Damn it!
Oh, cutie!
What about him?
Maybe this will help you
stabilize your magic.
Not really.
Well, let's try it.
You shouldn't have gone there.
Well, well,
if you want magic,
then do it.
The black market
is not a place for cute ladies.
You got lost?
Like one of the elite
wizard knights,
I'll help you get out of here.
Get lost, insect.
Hey!
I found something really cool!
You didn't buy it, did you?
She says so.
So you bought it.
Look!
We're people!
See?
So what?
He-ha!
It's...
Hey, you're...
Sekki! He-ha!
How are you?
My name is He-ha.
Oh, you're Sekki!
Who?
I was giving up on him.
In the black market?
He's one of those beauties?
Wait a minute.
Are they also in the black market?
Bastard!
I'm so jealous!
Besides,
it was because of you
that I ended up in the black market.
He-ha!
You're pissing me off!
War!
My win!
Stop!
