        <pre>It was said that humanity would be destroyed by demons and one mage was able to save this world.
He was given the title of the king of the magicians and he became a legend.
So, guys, your first task.
The first task?
Like the knight Richard.
And what is it?
I hope it is worthy of my special queen.
Yes, be proud of it.
You will have to hunt wild boars in the village of Soshi.
Wild?
Boars?
Boar!
What a miserable job!
You call her miserable?
Yes, I will kill boars with bare hands.
Do not dare to underestimate the wild boars.
Legs in hand and on a hike.
Or you are dead.
Calm down.
We're coming.
No matter how it is, this is our first task as knights and sorcerers.
I'm already in anticipation.
I will have to hunt wild boars.
What?
Are you still complaining?
I'm not complaining at all.
It's just that I can't even control my magical powers.
Should I go at all?
Her name is Mad Cyclone.
Cool!
Cool, huh?
Of course.
Poor thing.
The man gave the word, the man will keep it.
Let's go!
Fly!
Wow, Magna, we're like the wind.
Idiot, hold on tight, or you'll break into the cake.
Yeah.
So this is where the magical stones are.
Find it.
Yes, sir.
Dissolve in the fog.

I've been dreaming of the day when I would never be able to reach you
Even so, one step at a time, even if it's a short-lived world,
I want to give you an iron wall that has collapsed over and over again
I ran to the distant future
I've overcome all the worries I still see
I drew that day, so that I could be myself
One day, I'll continue to draw
With you, with hope
Just like an angel from the past
You and I met
Let's call it a miracle
One day, I'll continue to draw
There's a boar following me!
A huge one!
This is definitely a wild boar!
I think it shouldn't be using magic
It's catching up!
Shouldn't we help him?
I have a break now.
I spent too much money on the flight.
It wasn't that easy to get you two here.
Nothing will happen to him. He's alive.
But...
If you're so worried, you can help him.
No!
I'll do it.
What's wrong with me?
You're finished!
I think I'm done for.
Good job, Asta!
But that's not all.
What a catch!
What about you, Eve?
Three or four boars, you know, it's not that easy.
You're strong enough.
Old Seihya will be pleased.
So let's have a party.
Seihya, the mayor of the village of Soshi.
Do you know him?
Yes, we've known each other for a long time.
I'm from the village of Rayaka.
We flew over her.
When I was a kid, I was a hooligan.
What's changed?
When I got my grimoire, I was so rude.
I ran to the village of Soshi to get it.
And then...
Here you go!
Hey, snot!
What are you doing, huh?
You want to die, old man?
You're the only one who's going to die here.
Catch him!
Take this!
You'll pay for this!
And now you're going to pay for this!
And now...
What are you going to do?
Punishment time!
Hey, stop it!
Since then, I've called that old man many times.
Real men will never harm others.
Get it!
Help the weak to pacify the strong.
That's what makes you a real man.
Apple!
A real man will never make others worry about himself.
He's been pulling my ass every time.
And he's strong.
And then I found out that old man Seiki
had a lot of magic
and in his youth also tried to become one of the knights.
And it was he who suggested that I try myself
on the knight of magic.
Oh, it seems that during this time you've become stronger.
I've been using my magic all the time.
In that case, don't you want to try
to pass the exam in the knight of magic?
Huh? I pass the exam?
You're already quite experienced.
No.
It's impossible.
I'm just a simple village kid.
Nothing is foreseen.
How should your origin
affect anything?
Your future depends only on you.
I'm sure you can achieve
what I couldn't in my time.
Old man.
Be a man, Magne.
So, what does the knight of magic do?
You don't even know that?
If it wasn't for him,
I wouldn't be here right now.
When I was able to become a knight of magic,
he was the happiest man.
A good man.
Yes.
And he came to the capital
to quickly earn money for his village.
But I think he wanted to see me too.
I'm sorry.
He tricked me for every little thing.
He was the one who showed me
what a real man should look like.
I wanted to be like him,
the man I respect the most after yam.
Magne?
What the hell?
It's a village.
It's like it's in the fog.
Wow, they're not lucky with the climate.
Bullshit!
It's magic!
Oh, come on!
The village of the dry.
A magic fog?
Even if we go in there, it doesn't look like we can get where we need to.
We'll lose direction and eventually just wander in the fog.
Magic that can cover the entire village?
Not a single resident is capable of that.
And it doesn't look like the magic of old Seiki.
What's going on here?
Hey!
Yeah?
Cut the fog with a sword!
Got it!
Don't be silly.
Somehow I have to cut the fog.
Bullshit!
Since it's magic, your sword will cut it.
Oh, yeah!
Great!
It works!
Let's go!
Yeah!
To the right!
Got it!
To the left!
Yeah!
It looks like you know where to go.
Of course.
To the left!
Can you feel it?
Yeah.
It's...
...powerful magic.
Straight!
Be careful.
We have to be on the square.
Can you feel it?
God damn it!
Make the flame ball explode!
Magna, is that you?
Nick, what's going on here?
Old man!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Old man!
Hey!
Get up!
Old man!
Our mayor!
He tried to protect us.
Grandpa, they came!
Knight of the Eternity!
Your prayers are heard!
Can a man die so easily?
Bastard!
It's your business!
How dare you break my schedule?
In ten seconds you will be executed.
Damn, I'm almost out of power!
Gast!
I won't forgive you!
Black Clever.
Why are you here?
Why do you need all this?
Who the hell are you?
They don't look like spies or robbers who attacked the village.
Who are they?
They didn't tell us that the knights live nearby.
Perhaps they have an official task.
How did they get through our foggy barrier?
Black Beaks.
They don't go to the knights as a gathering of violent demand.
Fighting them is an empty waste of time.
Five minutes.
And we'll get rid of the useless people who don't know anything.
And we'll keep searching.
Hey, I'm talking to you!
The magic of the fog.
Illusory whirlwind.
You're stupid if you think you can get into the fog so easily.
Disappear from the fog.
Damn it!
Recently, he also cut my ice.
I don't know what spell he uses, but his sword can cancel magic.
You can't let him get too close.
I'm asking you why you're trying to kill all the villagers of the village.
This world is divided into several regions.
Noble lands, where the wise live.
Common lands, where the common people live.
And abandoned lands.
The village of Soshi is located in abandoned lands.
People who inhabit these lands.
Lowest race, capable only of low-level magic.
Just like beasts, unable to use tools of labor.
These weak-minded creatures could take my time.
What's bad about it is to clear your path.
Beasts?
You three are strong enough to become knights-magicians, aren't you?
And you came here just because it's one of your tasks.
Don't you think you're dirty pigs?
It must be good to live in the upper lands.
They probably have a holiday or something.
Why don't they just go there?
It's not that easy.
Why?
Only strong magicians can live in the upper lands.
And as for us, they have a lot of prejudices.
Even though we're all human.
Well, then I'll become a knight-magician,
and then a king of magicians.
And I'll make everyone equal.
And our village is the best.
Thank you, Asta.
If someone like you were on my side, we would have lived like that a long time ago.
What did you say?
Respect the elders!
You will never become a knight-magician,
not to mention the king of magicians.
You can't even conjure.
Hey!
I live just to protect people like that.
I see.
So these pigs are so important to you.
I can beat them.
That's...
The combination of ice and mana.
Endless ice cell.
And now, will you protect your favorite herd?
I hate the word slow,
but it seems that this will be the most effective.
Asta!
Dissolve.
You can not only dissipate, but also reflect magic.
But that's not enough.
I can create ice fragments endlessly.
Try it.
Defend.
Damn you!
Asta and I are connected by the salvation of the inhabitants.
Not to mention that my mana is at the limit.
And there are four more magicians.
The level is no less than the knight-magician.
And that Khmer has not yet revealed all the secrets.
Yes, guys,
your first task has not been completed.
Bad things.
But if I run away now,
then how can I later consider myself a man?
I'm just as simple a man as you are.
And I will not hurt you.
Magna!
How long will you last?
Oh, who can not even cope with his magic?
Apparently, in the black bull, it is very tight with skillful magicians.
Rejection after rejection.
You are a beast.
And you can not protect your skin.
If you run away now,
I'll let you live, knight-magician.
It's not like that.
A real man never leaves anyone.
I'm from the royal family.
My magic is stronger than the rest.
Back, Noel.
And in the end I just get in their way.
I'm sorry.
I have no reason to be here.
If you run away now,
I'll let you live.
Exactly.
I'm royal blood.
I can not die in such a place.
I need to run.
Knight-magician, please.
Save us.
This little girl is asking me for help.
I have to protect them.
Another spell.
Now I can not.
Just run away.
I have to protect them.
Like a member of the royal family.
And as one of the black bulls.
