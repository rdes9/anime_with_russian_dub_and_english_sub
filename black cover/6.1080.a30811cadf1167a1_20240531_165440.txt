It seemed that humanity would be destroyed by demons, but one mage was able to save this world.
He was given the title of the king of the magicians, and he became a legend.
The exam in the knight and sorcerer, Asta and Yuna were able to overcome this test.
The magic of the wind, Tornado!
Number 164!
What? Really? All the captains!
Raise your hand!
I want to enter the golden dawn!
Number 165! No more proposals!
Oh, it's not surprising.
Since you have no magic, you don't need anyone.
Someday I will become the king of the magicians!
And you, busy? Come to me.
Asta and Yuna were able to pass the exam in the knight and sorcerer, and now they are one step closer to the dream of becoming the king of the magicians.
I'm Asta from the village of Heij, and today I...
Oh, my God.
Welcome to the worst of the knights and sorcerers' detachment, the black bull.

Are you the shaman right there?
What's your name?
Yune.
I'm Klaus Lunet.
Not a royal bloodshed, you know.
Just a fellow from the village and yet he let you occur.
Don't even think that becoming a full member of our squad is that easy.
I'm sure you'll be accepting me soon.
You have a sharp tongue.
That's not all!
Now you've made me angry!
I'll rub you in powder!
Come on, do it!
Die!
What a noise!
It looks like I've had too much to drink.
My head!
Today you're as charming as the angel of my younger sister, Marie.
Shut up, you morons!
They're fighting again.
Again?
Hey, be careful!
That's scary.
But today we're in the same squad.
I'm Asta from the Ancient Age!
Glad to meet you all!
And I'll become the King of the Magi!
The pudding you hid was delicious!
The last pudding in your life!
You two are sick of it already!
And if because of your noise you wake up my younger sister, then pizza!
Shut up already!
The only thing I remember is the time I sang a song with an old man.
Thank you!
No one heard me.
This is for you!
For my pudding!
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
You're going to get drunk already!
And without you my head hurts!
Shut up, drunk!
What did you say?!
Youngster!
No, no, no!
Nothing like that!
Well, well, if you count the crows, I'll kill you!
Come on, get down!
I told you to shut up!
In the name of my angel, Sister Mary!
I'll kill you!
And you!
Hooray!
Get the fuck down!
He just broke the wall!
Captain!
Captain, take half!
It's so tasty!
Captain, drink with me!
Mr. Yami, I hope no one said anything inappropriate to you, otherwise I'll kill him!
Captain, fight me!
Just don't hold back!
Don't pay attention to these children and let me through the glass!
Hey, hey, try it!
Try it!
Isn't it tasty, Mom?
I'm sorry, I can't stand it anymore.
Can I see my sister?
Yes, yes, how much you adore me!
But shut up!
I'm sorry!
We have a replacement.
Where is he?
Over there.
Help me!
What did you forget there?
Help me!
I have no idea.
Karatyzhka, your new comrade.
Karatyzhka?
Karatyzhka?
What's your name?
Yes, I'm Asta from the village of Heich.
Nice to meet you!
Heich?
Yes, it's Zahalustia.
Hey, introduce him to the rest.
Oh, right.
So, you already know him.
This is Gordon Agrippa.
Nice to meet you.
He's pretty gloomy and you never know what's in his head, but he's a good guy.
And this is Vanessa Neteca.
She's good at getting drunk, but she's a good person.
I'm not good at getting drunk.
Heich, a little village on the edge of the world?
Yes.
You came from the dead and immediately became a knight of magic.
You should have tried very hard.
If you want, I'll personally reward you.
Of course I want.
But in my heart there is already a goddess named Sister Lily.
So, let's continue.
What?
I'm the next one.
This is Lakvold.
He likes to fight.
We just win battles, but he's a good guy.
Nice to meet you.
Do you like to fight?
Well, of course.
I love fighting.
Do you want to fight?
What?
Hey!
Look.
This is my younger sister Maria.
She's an angel.
So?
Listen here.
If you touch her with your finger, I'll kill you.
What?
This is Gosha Dlai.
He's a little obsessed with his sister, but he's a good guy.
This is Charmy Pappitson.
He eats too much, but she's a good person.
Nice to meet you.
This is Gray.
I don't quite understand him, but he's a good guy.
Hi.
And this is Magnus Wing.
He's a hooligan, but he's a good guy.
That's creepy.
And I'm Finral Rollcase.
He's popular among girls.
And the last, but not least,
Captain Black Bull.
I'm Mizuki Hiro.
He didn't say he was a good guy.
Thank you for accepting me.
That's not all.
The rest either do their homework,
or have a rest, or go for a walk.
Try to get along with them.
I will.
I'll make friends with everyone.
I'll say it again.
Nice to meet you.
My head.
You're too loud for your height.
Yeah.
Shut up.
I'm sorry.
All right.
Tell him what to do, but don't kill him.
What?
Did you hear that?
Mr. Yami told me to explain everything to you.
I'll gladly help you.
You look like a hedgehog in some kind of hole.
You're just a regular hooligan.
You don't look like a hooligan.
And you're a new member of the Black Bull?
How could a hooligan like you look like Mr. Yami?
Do you want a coat of Black Bulls?
A coat of Knights of the Black Bulls?
That's cool.
All right.
Do you want it?
Of course.
Here you go.
Do you want it that badly?
In that case,
you have to break my right hand, Mr. Yami.
A real man, Magnus Wingo.
It's time for you to be dedicated to the Black Bull.
That's creepy.
Black Clever.
Hey, Lucas Cage.
If you want one of these nakidas,
you have to pass my test.
I got you.
He's doing his rituals again.
I wish.
You can do it.
You can do it.
Let's get started.
First, show me your strength and endurance.
Show me your strength and endurance.
5,000 press.
Got it.
5,000 push-ups.
No, that's not all.
You can do it.
You can do it.
It's not bad.
It's not that bad, though.
Because in this world,
everyone can do magic,
and his actions don't make sense,
but he has a lot of energy.
How about you?
You've got a little bit of courage.
So what?
Now I can get my nakid.
Fuck you!
You're a jerk.
It can't be that easy.
You have to pass the test.
It's a decision.
You can use magic,
or something else.
The main thing is to turn around
or block my spell.
If you can do it,
consider that you're already
one of the Black Beaks,
and you'll get your nakid.
I want to.
Got it.
That's all I can do.
Shut up.
Get your
nakid.
Are you ready?
Yes.
Then catch it.
I'm ready.
Come on.
Not bad.
Yeah.
I can do it.
Now let's start
the real test.
It's so hot.
Fire magic.
Explosion.
Flame ball.
Die.
What the fuck?
Damn, I'm dead.
Leave everything
to your intuition.
With his muscle strength and speed
and great eyesight,
Asta always
won the enemies of the Cutting
and their magic, but
Magne's magic was way too
fast for Asta.
How fast?
Even if he cuts him.
The impulse from the attack
will touch him,
and the two halves will hit him.
I can't.
When he realized his limit, his brain turned off.
When his body did not give up.
And thanks to the greatest reflex, he still could.
He was able to find a way out.
When he realized his limit, his body did not give up.
I hit it! I hit it!
Great!
It's been a long time since anyone has been on a mission without my help.
He didn't just cut it, he hit his attack.
So, with this sword, you can not only chop, how interesting.
Wow!
Of course, I knew that he could cut magic, but to beat it, this sword is amazing.
Well, damn, I thought I was going to die.
Too close.
And what did he want? How to eat a newcomer on his first day?
Wait, is he alive there?
Oh, you little bastard.
What? He took such a blow and at least ...
I managed to cancel the spell in time.
But you almost devoured me with my magic.
Oh, you little bastard.
Scary, scary, scary, scary, scary, scary, scary, scary.
Cool!
What?
You didn't just block my magic, you also threw it in the air.
I like you, little bastard.
Actually, my name is Asta.
I'm sorry I laughed at you for your magic.
Actually, I'm not from the capital myself.
I'm from the village of Rayaka in the north of Heiji.
What? Seriously? So Rayaka is still deaf.
Who would say?
In fact, I don't just have little magic.
I don't have any magical powers at all.
What? You don't have any magic at all?
And you were able to repel my attack?
Well, yes.
That's even cooler.
That means you're a real man.
Not bad, man.
Do you want to eat?
Let's do the second one.
And another one.
Let's try to kill each other.
That was amazing.
Thank you.
Here, try it, it's very tasty.
Thank you.
Here, take half.
Here you go.
Thank you.
Tasty.
Okay, okay.
We have no other business.
Here you go.
It's yours, Asta.
You don't want it?
No, I want it, I want it, I want it.
It's mine.
Come on, try it.
And another one.
Here you go.
It looks good.
What do you think, Mr. Yami?
It looks simple.
From this moment on,
you're officially a knight of the Blackbeak enchantment.
Work so as not to disgrace our name and Mr. Yami.
Thank you.
I'll be glad to work with you.
Shut up.
I'm sorry, next time I'll be more careful.
The captain told you to shut up.
So, is this a newcomer?
Yes.
Bukashka.
Bukashka.
Bukashka.
Bukashka.
Bukashka.
Bukashka.
Bukashka.
Bukashka.
Bukashka.
Bukashka.
Bukashka.
Bukashka.
Bukashka.
Bukashka.
Bukashka.
Bukashka.
Bukashka.
Bukashka.
Bukashka.
Bukashka.
Mini Clever
Reality.
The knight of swords 24 hours.
Cold.
Yes, Mr. Yami!
Yes, Mr. Yami.
I don't see anything.
Yes, Mr. Yami.
Get out of here.
Yes.
