        <pre>I have to become the king of the magicians.
The king of the magicians? You?
By using these chains, I can determine the level of his magical power.
You don't have a drop of magic.
You must have been born like this.
That's why you don't have a grimoire.
I think you don't have enough drops.
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.
I think you don't have enough drops.
The world of magic is all about it.
What a worthless find.
What?
What the hell?
So no matter how hard I try,
I can't use magic.
Just think about the fact that there is someone so pathetic.
You can't even find a job,
and even more so become the king of the magicians.
I'm more than sure that your gifted friend
is also laughing at you behind your back.
Maybe that's right.
Yuna is so amazing that he chose the four-leaf clover.
And I...
You can't achieve anything in this world.
All you have to do is give up.
You were born a loser.
Yes, he's right.
No matter how hard you try,
there are things that you can't do.
I guess I have to...
Hey!
Who did you call a loser, Asta?
It's true that you can't become the king of the magicians.
Did you hear that?
Even your friend says it's impossible.
Because I'm going to be their king.
What?
He's not a loser.
He is.
Asta is my rival!
What?
He is your rival?
A loser without a clover of magic?
That's not all.
I'm sorry for this worthless spectacle, Yuna.
Give me a few seconds.
I'm going to get rid of him.
Is that Grimoire?
I knew it.
It can't be that he wasn't chosen.
Asta has always been like that.
You can expect anything from him.
He's always done stupid things and he still does them.
I will become the king of the magicians
and protect you and the others.
I will make everyone happy
and we will have everything we can wish for.
I will prove it to everyone.
You will?
Even if you are poor or orphan,
you have a chance to become the king of the magicians.

A boy's oath.
A boy's oath.
10 years ago.
Hold on.
Yuna!
How are you?
I'm fine.
Yuna, how are you?
Give me your hand.
Stop.
Oh my God, Yuna, you're such a crybaby.
Well, then I'll help you.
Okay?
Yeah, great, let's go.
Everyone's waiting upstairs.
Let's go.
It's delicious, but too hard.
This is our sister Lily. She cooks very well.
When I grow up, you'll come out and cook for me, right?
This is my father. Do you want to marry him?
No, I want to marry you.
Sister, come out, come out for me, come out for me, come out.
Is that so?
Asta, this is impossible.
Sister, well, she's a nun.
That's not all, Yuna.
As long as I don't grow up, I'll never give up.
Well, good luck to you.
Then the world plunged into a deep, deep darkness.
And when the demon tried to destroy it...
Yeah, that's not right.
...one brave sorcerer appeared and fought the demon to bring back the light in this world.
And finally, when he defeated him, the bright light emanating from this magician spread all over the world.
The long, long night finally ended. This was the dawn of our world.
Like this!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Like this!
That sorcerer was given the title of King of the Magi, after which he became a legend.
King of the Magi?
And they lived long and happy.
Hey, sister, does the King of the Magi still exist?
Yes.
The title of the King of the Magi was passed down from generation to generation.
And all this time they have been protecting us with their magic.
And all this time they have been protecting us with their magic.
It is thanks to them that the inhabitants of our kingdom can live in peace.
Wow!
Is the King of the Magi so important?
He is the second most important after the King.
Then I decided!
What are you talking about, Master?
I will be the King of the Magi!
Sister?
I'm sorry, I just didn't expect this.
But why do you want to become one of them?
Well, he defeated the demon, didn't he?
That means he's very strong, that's cool!
And I also want to be cool!
And one more thing.
If I...
If I become the King of the Magi,
then I can also make everyone happy.
And you can also wear beautiful clothes and have everything you want!
I'm going to rebuild this little shitty church!
Shitty?
I can conquer you, sister!
I'll be waiting for you, Master!
Yes.
The King of the Magi.
I will be the King of the Magi!
And that's why, sister, come out for me!
That's a completely different topic.
And that's not all!
I won't give up!
No!
I won't give up!
No!
I won't give up!
I won't give up!
I won't give up!
I won't give up!
I won't give up!
December.
Why?
Why? I still can't use magic!
Thank you, Asta.
So you're going to...
No.
You...
No.
You...
No.
Come out for me, please.
Yuna, at least you don't cry.
Nesh doesn't stop crying.
Yuna, leave it to me.
Asta, at the end of the day, I'm going to be the king of the magicians,
and it's easier to calm down one or two children.
Come on, come on, come on.
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry.
It's already quiet.
That's how you hold the king of the magicians.
Shut up.
Shut up.
Hello, everyone.
I need someone who can do one task.
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I want...
Someone can deliver this mail.
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I want...
This is a very important letter.
Can you handle it, Yuna?
Me?
Well, it's really important.
I can't trust him, Asta.
So I'm counting on you.
I have to see the mayor of the neighboring village.
I wanted to ask him for food so that it would be easier for us to survive the winter,
because now we have very few products.
Yuna, let me go.
No, my father asked me.
I'll go.
Can you handle it?
Yes, I can.
I'm going.
Come on, Asta.
You can chop firewood.
If you can't use magic, then at least help me.
Shut up.
You also have to dig potatoes.
I've finished a long time ago.
What?
It seems that the night will be cold.
Enough already.
Get out of my bar.
What the hell?
If you want to drink more, then bring more money.
No one will pour you here for free.
Who gave up your party?
Who gave up your booze, you moron?
Damn it.
Damn it.
Ouch.
The snow is getting bigger.
We have to be careful.
Oh, thank you.
Tell your father that I got it.
Of course.
Please forgive me.
It's late. Be careful.
Thank you very much.
I'm sorry.
The young man was supposed to be back.
I'm hungry.
And my father is not home yet.
Let's just eat without them.
No.
I'm hungry.
I'm hungry.
I'm hungry.
I'm hungry.
Let's just eat without them.
No.
It will be dishonest to the young man.
Boo-boo.
The pendant.
It's mine.
I'm just exchanging it for money.
Give it back.
Damn it.
Where did you get such a thing?
Give it back.
Give it back.
It's mine.
What is it?
How are you going to take it with this magic?
Do you want to fight me and die?
Young man!
Who are you?
It's Veshuna.
Give it back.
Give it back.
Give it back.
Give it back.
Give it back.
Give it back.
Don't touch me with your dirty hands.
Damn you.
Not yet.
Not yet.
Scream.
I'm not done yet.
Get out of here.
Not yet.
What the hell?
Why did he come to me?
Asta.
I'm sorry.
I...
I...
Don't worry.
I told you that you can rely on me.
Asta.
Asta has always been like this.
What?
What is it?
This sword!
Who are you?
Asta!
It's a lobe that can't even wield.
He has broken my spell.
Even without magic, I will become the king of magic.
Never give up.
This is my magic.
Asta!
I developed my body because I couldn't use magic.
It seems to me that it was useful after all.
Asta.
Asta, how are you?
I'm sorry.
It's all my fault.
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
I'm going to become the king of magic.
I will become the king of magic and protect you and everyone else.
I will make everyone happy and we will have everything we can dream of.
And then I will prove to everyone...
Prove?
That even if you are poor or orphan, you can become the king of magic.
We can?
We really can.
Everyone can if we work hard on it.
Everyone?
Me or even you, Yuna?
I will never cry again.
Maybe not even.
Yuna, me too.
I'm going to become the king of magic.
I will become stronger and be able to protect everyone.
I will make everyone happy.
Yuna, look, I have my own grimoire.
I don't care if it has gone, but I will take care of it my whole life.
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my.
You saved me again.
I'll pay you back someday.
Asta, do you remember our oath?
So you want to stand against them too?
That means, Yuna, you're my rival!
That means you didn't forget. I thought you were just laughing at me.
I didn't want to be too kind to my rival.
But it was you who gave me hope.
Whether you're poor or poor,
any of us can become better than anyone in this world.
And prove to everyone.
And make my sister and everyone else happy!
Let's see who will be the first to become the King of Magicians!
