Upon arrival in the village of Soshi, Asta, Noelle and Magna meet a mysterious enemy.
They fight desperately, trying to protect the villagers, but the enemy's magic is too strong.
You can not only spread, but also reflect the magic.
But this is not enough. I can create endless ice fragments.
Well, protect them.
Damn you!
My hands and feet are tied to the salvation of the inhabitants.
Not to mention that my mana is at the limit.
Yes, guys, your first task was not completed.
Bad things are happening to us.
Well, if I run away now, how can I later consider myself a man?
I'm just a man like you. I will not hurt you.
I'm from the royal family. My magic is stronger than the rest.
Back, Noelle.
As a result, I just get in their way.
Oh, Mr. Knight!
Save us!
This little girl is asking for help.
I have to protect them!
Now I can not just run away.
New spell?
The water magic of creation. The logo of the sea dragon.
When the magician becomes stronger, new spells appear in his grimoire.
Usually, to do this, you need to train your magical power using the spells you already have,
improving their power and efficiency.
But sometimes sharp emotions, sharp changes or hard decisions can become an impulse.
I will protect them as a member of the royal family and as one of the black bulls!
Black Bulls!
Black Bulls!
Black Bulls!
Black Bulls!
Little sister!
Not so cool!
What power!
Hey, Noelle, what did I tell you? You can do it when you want!
What is it? What kind of magical power is this?
In the meantime, the black bull is patiently waiting for the moment
to wear out its fangs and strangle them in the throat of the victim!
You three have enough magical powers if you can join the knights of the sorcery.
But I have no magic!
But this will not stop!
I will strangle you!
Lord Hiss!
What a fool!
Did he...
succeed?
He froze the ground to extinguish my escape?
Even if your sword is able to dissipate magic, it seems that you are just an ordinary person.
Now it's my turn.
Sleep, eternal sleep.
Asta!
Your spell is impressive.
However, this is only a matter of time.
Perhaps I can create a small door.
About 25 seconds.
I see you really like to waste my time.
You will have to pay for this.
I have no power at all, but I must continue to fight.
Fire and ice.
If I compare their magical properties, then I have an advantage.
But this fucker has enough magic to extinguish my flame.
He is too strong.
I'm sorry, Mr. Yami.
But I can't handle this guy.
Not yet!
Asta!
You managed to survive.
Amazing.
And you're pretty strong.
However, with such wounds, you can't swing the sword.
Not yet!
Wild animal.
I'm sorry, Mr. Yami.
I'm sorry, Mr. Yami.
You understand me.
I'm sorry, mr. Yami.
ulating!
Wild animal!
I'm not done yet.
Just think about it, that someone from the Young trapped King of Cavalry.
Are you proud of that,えー?
Let's make him go up!
Magna!
Magna!
Magna!!
Yeah, right, really really good!
Well done Magna!
Oh Indian.
Now you solved it out of the blue,去了 ла рак outsв too,
dude!
I come in lats!
You're not just a hooligan, you're a gift.
Old man.
How do I look?
Yeah, you look good. Be a real man.
Yeah.
I won't give up until the last breath.
Otherwise, what kind of man am I after this?
This shield, I can get out of it, right?
Well, I think so.
I'm leaving the villagers to you, Nell.
Wait!
You don't even have a chance to win.
Why don't you just give up?
If I give up, who's going to protect them?
I got it.
Not just for the sake of the promise.
I will become the king of the magicians to protect everyone.
The king of the magicians, huh?
What a stupid dream.
It's a pity, but you'll die in a minute.
You freak, as if I let you.
If you want to kill him,
you'll have to kill his mentor first.
Magna?
You know, Asta, you're a real man.
You fool.
You can't wait to go to the grave?
30 seconds.
Cool.
Come on, Asta.
Let's tear it up.
Get all the magic I have left.
The ball of the soul.
The magic of fire.
The prison of the deadly ball.
And these are your last rifts?
How exhausting.
Time.
No!
They distracted us from the blind zone to reflect magic.
I'm alive.
Be grateful, bandit.
Yeah, yeah, I managed to cast a spell.
Why don't you just shut up?
The flame won't go out.
So I'll just freeze him.
I'm not done yet.
My body is still moving.
Wait.
Now take this.
Black Clever.
The flame won't go out.
So I'll just freeze him.
I'm not done yet.
No!
My body is still moving.
Wait.
Now take this.
It's impossible for me to lose to this bandit.
I just wanted to be useful to the Lord.
They did it.
Sister?
Yes.
Now take this.
The flame won't go out.
So I'll just freeze him.
I'm not done yet.
No!
My body is still moving.
Wait.
The flame won't go out.
So I'll just freeze him.
No!
My body is still moving.
Wait.
The flame won't go out.
So I'll just freeze him.
Wait.
Why are you so relaxed?
Don't think of the crow as your mentor.
I'm so cold.
Whose cow is barking?
Damn, it's gone.
Damn, I missed it.
Well?
You've just been done.
You're so low-key.
So what?
I'm done!
Astor!
Did you knock yourself out?
He's so ridiculous.
He's an empty-headed guy.
An empty-headed, noisy and low-key guy.
But he's still amazing.
Phew.
We're saved.
He's just a kid.
Is he really just like us?
Magna, young lady.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
It's nothing complicated.
You're our saviors.
What?
He's crazy?
Hey!
Hey!
Are you out of your mind, you bastards?
I'll take a little break and take you to the capital
on my crazy cyclone.
Are you going to pray for your sins
in front of the people until the end of your life?
Is my magic sealed?
The knights of the sorcerers will untie you in a second.
Who are you? What did you want?
You're going to expose everything.
You won't make it.
It looks like it's the end.
In his body is an artifact.
Magelda.
An ice tomb.
What?
Damn fanatic.
He was so sure of someone.
Is it strong?
Idiots.
He went to such a place.
What were they looking for here?
Life.
What is life for you?
I will never recognize
people like you.
Never!
Never!
Grandpa.
Nick, let's go home.
Grandpa liked the view from here.
Yes.
Nick, I heard
that old man was trying to protect you.
Your grandpa was a real man.
My grandpa looked so happy
when he told me how he defeated the magicians
by putting them on the map.
Yes.
My grandpa gave it to me
and even bought a lot of delicious food
for everyone in this village.
My grandpa didn't pass the test,
but he always dreamed
of becoming a knight-magician.
Yes.
And he always, always felt sorry.
He felt sorry
that he didn't try his best
in his youth.
Yes.
But he was really happy
that Magna tried his best for both of them.
Yes.
Even if he was a villager.
But I...
I can also become a knight-magician.
Of course.
There is nothing impossible.
Only you can choose your future.
I'm also from the village
and I have no magic at all.
However, I could.
But you know, you'll have to sweat.
Do your best.
I'll try.
Yes.
And while you're in the squad,
I'm going to work hard
on every task
to get even closer to the title of knight-magician.
Phew.
You again for your stupidity.
But you must have a dream.
That's what makes you a man.
I'll be waiting for you, boy.
Yes.
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!
Damn bird!
Why did that hit your head?
Do you want to fight?
For some...
Huh?
What's this stone?
It's...
a treasure for my grandpa.
Hey, give it back! Give it back!
Come on, give it back! Give it back to me!
You can take it, if you like this bird so much.
It's less than I can thank you for.
Well, okay.
Such small evil eyes.
Honey!
If you want, fly to me.
Give it back! Give it back!
Give it back! Give it back!
You're out of my mind!
I'll burn you now!
Come on, stand still!
Give it back! Give it back!
What are you doing, damn bird?
So this is Hiss.
I see.
This is how the black bull got the magic stone.
Yes.
It doesn't matter.
We can split with them any minute.
In the meantime, we'll let them hold the stone.
The resurrection of the Lord is inevitable.
Thank you for watching.
Thank you for choosing us.
THE END
