To be continued...
It seemed that humanity would be destroyed by a demon.
But one mage was able to save this world.
He was given the title of a mage king, and he became a legend.
Asta and Yuna arrive in the capital of the kingdom of Clef,
a place where everyone dreams of becoming a wizard knight,
and the entrance exam will begin soon.

Just a second! The meat is almost ready!
Cool!
Wow! They have so many things here!
But it's too expensive!
It's different from our village.
So the king of the magicians lives there?
Probably, and the king too.
So one day this castle will be mine!
You wanted to say ours.
Don't worry, you'll be able to live there too.
That's my word.
Oh, calm down, calm down. Don't cry.
Let's hurry up and open the store.
It reminds me of the church.
I'm sure Sister Lily and the others are already missing me.
Impossible.
Hey, Yuna!
Hey!
Oh, how quiet and calm.
It's so good that Asta left.
You're doing your thing again.
But it's true!
Most likely they are already in the capital.
I hope they won't have any problems with the exam.
Me too.
Nothing!
Asta, Yuna, do your best.
So, where will this exam be?
Probably there.
What is it?
Fried purple snakes. I took them for a discount.
Does anyone want to see the fried purple snakes that I just caught?
Will you?
No.
They are super nutritious and give a lot of energy.
Impossible. Let's go there.
Do your best for the exam.
You are the hope of Cleaver.
The future of the kingdom is in your hands.
Don't relax.
I'll do my best.
You don't know him.
You are 163rd.
Next.
Yuna.
From the village of Hedge.
Yuna from Hedge.
Can I see your grimoire?
Four christs?
Oh, so that's what everyone is talking about.
Hey, this is that grimoire.
Seriously? Four christs?
Cool.
You are 164th.
Next.
I'm Asta, also from the village of Hedge.
And here is my grimoire.
Pretty dirty.
Is this really a grimoire?
Of course.
Look more closely.
Here. See?
Okay.
You are 165th.
Got it.
Great.
He must be very confident in himself,
since he came here from such a desert.
Oh my God.
I'm so nervous.
What the hell?
Sad, famous birds of Ancidore.
What? Really?
The weaker your magical power, the more they are around you.
Little parasites.
Hey, look at this guy.
There's not a single bird around him.
Hey, it's that one.
That one?
He's from some distant village of Hedge,
but he was chosen by a four-leaf clover grimoire.
What? Four-leaf clover?
Really?
He-he-he.
One of us will become the king of the magicians.
This is the beginning of our legend, young man.
Will become the king of the magicians?
I'll show you how I grew up during these six months.
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.
What the hell?
These birds.
What's wrong with them?
This is too much for a village.
Let's go.
Go away, you fucking birds.
Oh, they finally flew away.
I'm sorry I hit you.
It's okay, Cousin.
Who is he?
This look. The look of a killer.
His neck. He doesn't look like a magician.
This aura.
He's definitely my friend.
No, no, no, stop.
Don't judge from the cover book.
You just need to be friendly.
Well, dude, you look like a starper in your 15th year.
You must have had a hard time.
I see you're ready to die.
Oh, damn, I was wrong.
Oh, here you are.
What are you doing here?
Well, I'm tired of living with one boy.
Oh, he's...
The famous Finral Rolocase.
Finral Rolocase?
He has a rare spatial magic.
Hey, are you a cutie?
True, he prefers girls to knights and sorcerers.
And that one is Gordon Grippe.
He's an expert in occult magic.
I heard it's hard to talk to him.
It's even scary.
Hey, the captain of the knight and sorcerer squad
shouldn't kill candidates.
And why are you even here?
I went to shit and got lost.
Captain of the squad?
So he is...
God of Destruction, Yami Tsukihiro?
Damn.
What do you think you're doing?
The end of your life.
Yami?
The captain of the black bull?
The black bull?
There's a lot more harm on the battlefield
than good, right?
There seems to be no decent knight and sorcerer in this squad.
A playboy and a guy you can't talk to?
I see.
I don't want to go in there.
What the hell?
I've been in contact with him.
My head is about to explode.
Let's go.
The exam is about to start.
What?
You'll have to live a little longer.
Try for your life saved,
or I'll kill you.
What?
See you.
I want the captain to kill me.
What was that?
Are you all right?
Yes.
It must be terrible to meet face to face
with the captain of the black bull, Yami.
Oh, yes, I'm Seki.
Seki Bronzadze.
Nice to meet you.
I'm Astor.
Me too.
This is the captain of the silver-winged eagle,
Nozel Silver.
And this is...
One of the captains.
What a priest he is.
Does this shit bother him?
Captain Bogrova Volva.
Fugilion Vermilion.
From the name of Bogrova,
it should be noted that he uses magic.
I see.
I see.
Captain Green Bogomol.
Jack the Ripper.
What does Bogomol mean?
Well, Bogomol is like a bug.
The magic of Captain Jack is able to split the earth in half.
Awesome!
But I don't want to be Bogomol.
The bugs are too slow.
Captain Blue Rose.
Charlotte the Red Rose.
And I don't want to be Bogomol.
Captain Blue Rose.
Charlotte the Red Rose.
What a beauty.
Yes, but the sister is more beautiful.
Captain Purple Haircut.
Gelder Poiset.
Is that all?
I'm not interested in a paradoxical guy like him.
Captain Royal Pavlina.
Dorothy Answorth.
Is she a lunatic?
In general, her only occupation is sleep.
Then how did she become a captain?
She has a unique power, and few people have seen what she is capable of.
Captain Aquamarine Deer.
Rio Boa Mortier.
He's so young.
I heard that Captain Rio is 19.
19?
He's only four years older than me.
The path to becoming the king of magic is shorter than I thought.
The king of magic, huh?
Pretty strong dream.
But after the next king of magic,
they say he's the most promising candidate.
Captain Golden Dawn.
William Bungeance.
William Bungeance.
All members of his squad have a lot of faith in him.
And everyone says that in the last battle,
he was the leader of the enemy general.
I wish I could get a golden dawn.
Or a silver eagle.
Idiot.
Only the people of the royal blood and the elite
can get into these squads.
How annoying.
Why do we even have to do this?
This is an important exam that will determine the future of these young people.
It's time to go to bed.
Good night.
This is an important exam that will determine the future of these young people.
You have to be more serious about this.
Yes, yes, Mr. Suryo.
The captains are gathered in one place.
They say that the strength of each captain of the knight and sorcerer squad is equal to the strength of a hundred magicians.
And one of them will become the next king of magicians.
And where is the king of magicians?
The king of magicians?
The king of magicians would not have come to the exam.
The fact that all the captains gathered in one place is already a miracle.
Candidates.
Excuse me, what made you wait?
I will take this exam.
Magical tree.
Magical tree.
I'm still surprised by this.
So this is him.
He is the best in the title of the king of magicians.
The entry exam in the knight and sorcerer begins.
The Black Lion.
Now we will conduct several tests.
We, nine captains, will evaluate you.
Each will choose a squad worthy of his opinion.
And you will be able to join this squad.
If several captains have chosen you, you will be able to choose which squad to join.
Those who have not chosen any captain will not be able to join the knight and sorcerer.
Whatever it takes for me, I will become a knight and sorcerer.
Your first task.
You must take off on the broom.
But this ...
I did not do this before.
If the magician can control his magical power, he will take off instinctively.
For a magician, this is the main transport.
If you can't do it, you have nothing to do here.
So, let's get started.
From what we have seen, we can get enough information about what kind of magic and what kind of power it is.
There are quite a few candidates this year.
The path is rural, but this guy is cool.
The geniuses are chosen by the four ladders.
What does it mean?
It's strange, he has to get off the ground.
As if there were not enough magical powers.
I'll take off for a while.
How sorry.
I think we've already got rid of one.
How did he get here anyway?
Come on, it should be easy.
Relax and everything will work out.
Like this.
Wow!
Relax, got it?
Hey, are you a normal guy?
I still can't.
Okay.
What are you doing?
Well, I...
I told you.
You don't have to pass the same exam as normal people.
But...
Your future is already decided.
Don't take useless actions.
Yes, brother Nozel.
Your existence is already useless.
To be continued...
Just relax.
Just do your best.
I'm not done yet.
More, more.
I can, I can still.
Okay, the next exam will be the last one.
You will fight in a real fight.
So...
Everyone will fight with their opponent.
Grimoire is allowed to use it.
If we lose, it will significantly affect our results.
Everything will be decided by the choice of the opponent.
The battle is an essential part of our work.
Show us everything you're capable of.
As soon as one of you gives up or can't continue the fight, the exam ends for you.
Our doctor will immediately help you.
So fight with all your might.
Shit, all this time I just saw him screaming.
I need to find the strongest opponent.
I need to find the one who will fight with me.
Hasta, come with me.
Oh, Seki!
Do you really want to fight a loser like me?
Of course.
You're really a great guy.
First pair, go.
Yeah, yeah.
Let's fight in a fair fight.
So that we can both achieve our goals.
You don't have to try so hard anymore.
You're a pathetic rat that got into the wrong house.
Thank you for helping me look better in front of you.
In the knight's squad of sorcerers, I'll try to beat them both.
And have a great time.
Got it?
Village.
I'm going back to the pigsty.
I'm going back to the pigsty.
I'm going back to the pigsty.
And continue to enjoy my old life.
Seiki chose the weakest guy.
Seiki.
So, let's start.
Don't hold back, okay?
Let's make it, Hasta!
The magic of creation.
Big bronze Seiki's core.
How do you like my magic?
This ball protects me and I can attack without leaving it.
Attack and defense, two in one.
The core will block any of your useless attacks and demonstrate my defensive abilities.
And when you're out of breath, I'll finish you off.
Pretty good for the candidates.
What's that?
It's a crazy insect from the Amazon.
Come on, attack, don't hold back.
And now try to make it as exciting as possible.
Of course.
As you wish.
What?
Oh, come on!
I'm going in.
I'm not a wizard knight just to have a good time and get away from work.
I'm here to become the king of the magicians.

Thank you for choosing us.
THE END
THE END
Get away from me!
Get out of here!
Hey, what the hell are you doing?
Hey, young man, help me!
Help me!
That's shit.
I still haven't proven myself.
But I'm not done yet.
I'll pass, no matter what.
Black Clever, page 5.
The way to the title of the king of the magicians.
Never give up.
This is my magic.
