It seemed that humanity would be destroyed by demons, but one mage was able to save this world.
He was given the title of the king of the magicians, and he became a legend.
Here, it's yours, Asta.
What, you don't want it?
No, I want it!
Mine!
Well, try it!
And now?
It looks good! What do you think, Mr. Yami?
It looks quite simple.
From this moment on, you are officially the knight of the black bull charioteer.
Work to not disgrace our name and Mr. Yami!
Thank you!
I'll be glad to work with you!
Shut up!
I'm sorry, next time I'll be more careful!
The captain told you to shut up!
So this is a newbie.
A bull charioteer.
A bull charioteer.
A bull charioteer.
THE END
The base of the black bull.
Here's your room!
What? I didn't expect it to be so scary!
By the way, my room is twice as big!
My room!
What?
I never had my own room!
When I lived in the church, we all slept in the same room!
I'll clean up all the dirt!
I'll clean everything up!
In short, do whatever you want!
You're free until the beginning of the task!
Oh, by the way, Asta!
What is it?
Don't forget to write to your friends!
Well, from the church!
They're your family, aren't they?
I'm sure they'll be interested to know how you are!
Exactly!
Don't make them worry about you!
Be a real man!
See you!
Call me if you need me!
Of course! Thank you!
My first fortress.
I will give all my strength to become the king of the magicians.
I will never lose!
Got it, young man?
What a pity.
What did you have to give to this room?
Tomorrow I will read you a lecture on your duties as a knight or sorcerer.
I would prefer not to be your mentor.
But this is the captain's order, and I can only obey.
Are you listening?
Young man.
My name is Klaus.
I'm your mentor.
And you have to respect me.
Got it.
Don't be late.
THE END
What?
THE END
Well done, young man!
He was able to become the knight of the magicians, and that's our pride!
Young man is so cool! Cool!
I need to tell the others.
Sister Nana, what does it say?
God, what a terrible handwriting!
When is he going back there?
When he comes back, we should cheer him up.
I'm sure Asta will be crushed after the failure.
Let's have a potato party!
He writes that he has passed.
What?
What?
He has also passed.
What?
Come on!
Wow, he really did it!
Then I think he won't come back home.
I see.
So they both passed.
So, I'll go tell the others.
This is the first good news since the foundation of Heiji.
Yes!
I see.
So Asta has also passed.
Asta, young man, congratulations.
Keep trying.
Thank you.
It was not a dream!
Great! Go ahead!
Oh, come on!
Was she here yesterday?
Hey, newcomer, how did you sleep?
Good morning.
What about this wall?
What about it?
I don't think she was here yesterday.
Forget about it.
Our base is constantly changing its shape.
What?
Nothing, you'll get used to it.
Does it really change?
Yes, let's go.
Okay.
As a reward for yesterday,
I will personally show you a super cool base of black bulls.
Follow me, shorty.
I'm running, Mr. Sunshine.
Idiot, say Great Magna.
Idiot Great Magna.
Yes, it's you, idiot.
This is our dining room.
What do you think, right? It's huge.
Yes, in nature.
This is our swimming pool.
It's hot.
Such a heat for a black bull.
Not bad.
Have you already burnt yourself?
No, not yet, not yet, not yet.
It's too hot today.
I would add some cold water.
At the end of the corridor is the women's bedroom.
If you try to sneak in, they'll catch you.
No way.
And here is the toilet.
Toilet.
You're dead.
I'm sorry.
And here are the animals.
What for?
Mr. Yami's hobby.
Asta.
Yes?
I'll let you take care of them.
It's a very important role.
Even though I don't want to, but that's the way it is.
Feed twice a day, morning and night.
Well, try it.
Uh, yes.
Uti-puti-puti.
Here, eat.
Here's the library.
Yes.
This is the playground.
You can have fun here.
What?
Well, don't lag behind.
Well, wait.
I won't lose.
Oh.
Magna?
A black bull's cape.
What does it mean?
Hey, Asta.
She's like you.
She was also taken this year.
Like me?
Sounds great.
Hi, I'm Asta from the village of Heij.
Nice to meet you.
Let's get stronger together.
Who gave you the right to talk to me?
I can barely feel the mana in you.
Misha the Insect.
Insect?
Misha?
My name is Noelle Silver.
The blood of the royal family flows in me.
What?
The royal family?
Black Cleaver.
I'm sorry.
I'm just a bug that can be blown away with one breath.
That's better.
Wait a minute.
Who's the Insect here?
In the detachment, we are all equal like rats and monsters.
Who cares what kind of blood you have.
So, Asta.
Your status doesn't mean anything here.
Of course.
And how do you imagine that?
Villagers.
You don't understand a word.
I'll show you the difference between us.
Know your place.
I won't make it.
What?
Little bitch.
And you have steel nerves.
If you dare to do that to the elders.
It's your own fault.
How dare you stand up there?
How dare you?
I'm older than you.
And I'm from the nobility.
I'm the Insect.
I'm the Insect.
And I'm from the nobility.
What?
I don't care.
Even if you're the captain's sister of the Silver-winged Eagle.
The only person who agreed to take on such a trifle is Mr. Yami.
Thank you.
I've only been restrained by the fact that you're a girl.
Come on, I've had enough.
I've had enough of this detachment.
You...
Hey!
What the hell are you doing?
Who cares about this black bull?
I don't need this dirty mess.
You're the worst detachment from the knights of the sorcerers.
There's no place for me in this dump.
Bastard.
Apologize to the cape and Mr. Yami.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Apologize to the cape and Mr. Yami.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I tried so hard to get the cape.
I'm sorry, damn it.
What the hell was that?
I was looking for the toilet and suddenly found it outside.
What?
What the hell is that?
Noelle.
Why?
Why can't I...
get there?
Maybe...
I just...
The youngest daughter of the Silver family can't control her magical powers.
Who would have thought that such a child could be born in the royal family?
What a pathetic grimoire.
Are you sure about the royal blood?
What a disaster.
You can't even control your powers.
It's a pity that such a destruction is like you, my sister.
In such a disgraceful place,
the Silver-winged eagle is not needed.
You'd better die
instead of our mother.
You're trash.
I don't care.
I'll make them confess to me.
Looks like she had a hard time, too.
Hey.
Insect?
How long are you going to...
Now he's going to laugh, too.
I...
In such a disgraceful place,
the Silver-winged eagle is not needed.
What a disaster.
You can't even control your powers.
You'd better die instead of our royal blood.
No.
No?
No!
No!
I've shit my pants,
and now I can go to sleep.
What the hell?
I don't want to go.
Look at that.
Wow.
This is crazy.
Something magical came out of the control.
Don't you dare smell the spell.
It's going to suck if we don't do anything.
Let's attack this thing with magic,
and the girl is not made of iron.
Can you pull her out with space magic?
Don't joke like that.
I can't even get close to her.
That's true.
We'd have someone who could extinguish her magic.
No!
Now's the time.
Huh?
Come on, deal with it.
Deal with it?
Okay.
Wait, how do I get there?
I can't fly.
Then get over yourself.
It's time to overcome your limits.
The End
I'm done for.
I'm alive!
I'm alive!
Was it fun for them?
Yeah.
Now I'm all wet.
Thank you, space magic.
You're welcome.
Good job, man.
Yeah.
Hey, you.
You're trash.
They're laughing at me again.
You.
I'm shocked by your magic.
It's just something.
What?
I have no magic power at all.
Damn, I'm so jealous.
Learn how to control it, Noelle.
And no one will beat you.
Nas.
Nas.
Aston.
But I'm still going to beat you.
It turns out you're not good at controlling magic.
I should have told you earlier.
We are a detachment from the Thieves,
an unarmed black bull.
And your shortcomings.
They don't beat us, you fool.
It's good that everything's fine.
By the way, there's a restaurant.
You can lick your fingers there.
Maybe we should go there sometime.
But first, try this.
Huh?
That was amazing.
And I'm only good at controlling magic.
So if you want,
I can help you.
And I'll teach you how to use a woman's trick.
And I'll tell you about my angel,
my younger sister, Maria.
Let's be friends.
Come on.
Let's try together.
Let's try together.
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
The song was made for free home viewing.
Thank you for choosing us.
Thank you for watching.
See you soon.
