It seemed that humanity would be destroyed by demons,
but one mage was able to save this world.
He was given the title of the mage king, and he became a legend.
The capital of the kingdom of Clever.
Time went by, and the title was passed down from generation to generation.
The knights and sorcerers, under the command of the mage king,
defend this kingdom together.
The division of the knights and sorcerers consists of nine departments,
specializing in battles.
These heroes defend the kingdom, risking their lives to become the king of the magicians
or the knight sorcerers of the dream of anyone in the kingdom of Clever.
One hour later...
Anilibria TV presents...
Black Clever.
The third page.
The way to the capital of the kingdom of Clever.
I was dreaming of a dream that would never come true
Even so, it's a world full of uncertainties
A world that has changed over and over again
I want to keep my spirit alive
I ran to the distant future
I'll overcome all my worries
To be who I am, who I painted that day
One day, I'll paint the rest of my life
With the hope that you have
Someday, like an angel
You and I will meet
Let's call it a miracle

It's time for some lychee juice
Yuck!
One more sip!
Yuck!
You want some too?
What the hell?
I got my makeup
And I'm going to keep trying, even without any magic
That's not all!
It's not the end!
1001
I'm sure Yuna is training now too
I can't lose to him
1002
Asta is training for the entrance exam in The Wizard of Oz
Which is held in the capital of the Clever kingdom once every six months
Just like Yuna
That's enough for today
No, more
I'm sure he's doing the same
1001
1002
They were united by a common goal
The goal is to become the king of the magic
1503
Well, Yuna, can you understand?
Are you sure Asta should be admitted to the exam too?
Well, he says he wants it
Besides, the ones I put my hopes on
We won't be able to become the knights and sorcerers
If the one who was kicked out of there is so strong
There's no place for us
Forgive us
Oh
They decided not to pass the exam
And still, I think Yuna can do it
But I'm not sure about Asta
Well, he says he wants it
I'm telling you, I believe in Yuna
And sending Asta is pointless
Well, he says he wants it
In fact, do you think that if Asta goes to the capital
You'll be lonely, right?
Oh my God, father
Well, it's just
I think he still has no chance
And he better not even try
You know, the others will be missing him too
And I'll be lonely
It's the kids I'm going to play with
Why are you looking at me like that?
And you too
Father, I'll be a little lonely too
When Yuna and Asta leave
Of course
I grew up and brought them up
And I told Salgu that I wouldn't miss them
If it was possible
I would like them to stay in the church
But I don't want to interfere with their dreams
In fact
Besides, you're sure that Yuna will give up
And Asta will fail and in any case return home
Exactly
You're absolutely right
Yuna will pass and Asta will return home
Well, what about the book that Asta received?
It's actually a grimoire
Asta can't spell
How did he get it?
I'm not sure
But this
What is this?
No
My, my, my own grimoire
I don't even know how
But I managed to get it
Five-leaf clover
It can't be
Until I return to the church
The training is not over
Eat dust
Yuna, Asta
Return home
Who was the first?
Hmm
Yuna was a little faster
Oh, come on
Did you even watch?
Then
Who is faster to the church?
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I won
Sometimes Yuna behaves like a child
Yes, and he chose Asta from all the people
Not to mention that Yuna
How long will this continue?
I will become the king of magic
I'm scared
Black Clever
Oh, Yuna
Come to see me train?
Do you know what's going on?
Nothing. I was just bored.
So I came to laugh at how an idiot is doing some kind of nonsense.
What do you mean some kind of nonsense?
It's like that.
Without the ability to use magic, you are going to pass the test on the wizard knight.
You have no chance.
This is not decided yet.
Look, I even got a harem.
And I'm going to become a wizard knight.
And one day I will become a king.
Impossible.
We are poor and orphaned.
We...
We are not allowed to dream about such things.
You know...
You can't give up without even trying.
Everyone has a chance.
Shut up. We don't have a single chance.
No. I will continue to pursue my dreams.
It doesn't matter if you are poor or orphaned.
Anyone can shine in this world.
And we can do everything.
Make our dreams come true.
And make everyone happy.
And I will prove it to you.
Prove?
I will join the wizard knight and become a king...
...magic!
The wizard knight
Tomorrow, Ast and Juna will go to the capital of the kingdom.
We should be able to see them off with dignity.
Father went around all the villages in the city and asked for potatoes.
Father!
What kind of a look is that?
It's not for you alone.
To tell you the truth, it's mostly for Yuna.
Father!
Well, you know, Yuna can get into the knight of the sorcery, but you...
Father!
Asa, don't be ashamed if you fail the exam.
Huh?
Anyway, no one believes in you.
Are you trying to cheer me up, or are you trying to make fun of me in front of others?
You can come back at any time.
The church, your house.
No matter how old or old it is, it's your house.
That's right, Asa.
I'll miss you, Asa.
And Yuna.
We're a family.
Tell Yuna about it too.
Tell him he can come back whenever he wants.
I'm not worried about Yuna.
What are you doing?
As if something bad is going to happen to me!
I'm going to become the king of the sorcerers!
And then I'm going to go back to my sister!
And when it happens, you're going to be...
Okay, let's eat.
Shoma potatoes, tempura on the table,
potatoes cooked on the grill,
fried potatoes cooked on steam,
boiled potatoes according to Heiji's recipe,
potato juice,
and even a special pudding.
Wow! Bon appetit!
It's so delicious, Yuna!
It's delicious!
Hey, it's mine!
Asa, give it to us too.
It's delicious!
Take care of yourself.
Yuna, be sure to write to us.
Of course.
Good luck!
Come back soon!
He'll be back soon.
You know, Asa...
You know,
even if I don't believe in it,
what if you end up
with the sorcerer knight?
Yeah?
I'll believe that there's a chance,
that we have a chance to achieve anything.
And one day I'll join the sorcerer knights too.
Although it doesn't matter.
I'll be waiting.
Well, I'm going.
Hey, Yuna, wait!
Hey, damn handsome!
Even though we're rivals,
don't ignore each other's wives.
Oh!
Well, bye!
Bye-bye, guys!
Good luck!
See you.
Yuna, Asa...
You've grown so much since that moment.
Asa was always full of energy.
I'm fine.
She's Lily's sister.
She'll be working here from now on.
Don't hurt her.
Wow!
Lily's sister!
Yes?
Please get out of me!
I'm sorry!
Lily!
I think he's happy.
Maybe it's thanks to Asa.
Yuna's gotten stronger too.
Asa!
He's badly wounded.
It's all my fault.
He protected me.
What?
Yuna, you...
Asa, hold on!
Lily's sister!
Asa!
Please get out of me!
Thank God!
Do your best.
I believe in you.
Summer.
Asa and Yuna are going to the capital
to see the sun.
Asa and Yuna are going to the capital
to see the sun.
Asa and Yuna are going to the capital
to see the sun.
The capital is far from the village
and they have a long way to go.
The capital.
I wonder what it looks like.
Are we going to meet the mages?
We need to send a entry
into the Kingdom of the Magic stall.
Let's see.
I'm so nervous!
Nervous?
Don't you feel scared?
What if I do?
You don't change.
Let's hurry. The capital of the kingdom is very far away.
Hey!
I have to become the king of the magicians as soon as possible.
Because you will get there faster, you will not become the king of the magicians faster.
I will become the king of the magicians.
Oh my God, Asta, you are so amazing.
Sister, no, my lily.
I came back as I promised.
I became the king of the magicians.
And now sit down.
Okay.
Hold on tight.
Something like that.
How are you going to fly on a broom when you can't spell?
Well, I'll do it.
You?
Yes.
I got my makeup.
And I can do everything until I give up.
Let's hurry.
Or I'll leave you behind, young man.
Training until we get to the capital of the kingdom.
You will never change.
What? You can't catch up with me, can you?
Not yet. Not yet.
Stop.
We have a long way to go.
Not yet.
I'm not done yet.
Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot!
I wish the guys from the army had tried it.
Yeah.
This way.
No, that way.
Hey, wait.
Okay, don't get in my way.
I just helped.
And nobody asked you.
Like that.
Hey, my precious leaf juice.
What's up, young man?
Wow, it's huge.
So this is the capital.
The place where the king of the magicians lives.
Awesome. I did it.
Just wait, I'm coming.
I will become the king of the magicians.
After a long and dangerous journey,
Asta and Yuna arrive in the capital of the kingdom of Clever.
Waiting for the beginning of the challenge in the knight of the magicians.
Now they will have to fight many powerful enemies
to go further.

To be continued...
Clever!
The secret of the grimoire.
Hey, wait.
Are we small now?
Well, our grimoires are completely different.
Intriguing.
The size and thickness of the grimoire are determined by the type of the owner.
Great. Let's compare the grimoires.
This thing is dirty.
Honestly, are you afraid to lose?
Impossible.
Do you think you can say that just because it's a little prettier than mine?
No chance.
This is them, Yuna.
The knights of the magicians that we admired so much.
This is where our journey to the dream of becoming the king of magicians begins.
Black Clever, page 4.
The challenge on the knights of the magicians.
Never give up. This is my magic.
