HENCH VILLAGE
Somewhere in the outskirts of the village of Hench.
Here we go again.
HENCH VILLAGE
Easy, easy.
There we go.
These two have finally calmed down.
The brothers, or maybe the twins.
Well, no.
One of them is pretty calm,
and the other one looks like he's going to make a lot of noise.
And they don't look like each other.
Young one.
Well, what about the other one?
Hey, that was too much.
Asta.
So, you don't have to worry about anything else.
Today is your new home.
Asta.
Young one.
Fifteen years later.
HENCH VILLAGE
I hope we'll have a good harvest this year.
Yeah.
Opa!
Sister Lily!
What's that?
Again, this shorty from the church.
Someday I'll become the king of the magicians,
and I swear I'll make you happy!
So please, come out for me!
I'm sorry, Asta, but I'm the sister of everyone.
Not yet!
I'm sorry.
I won't give up!
Um, but...
I won't give up!
I'm really sorry.
One more chance, Sister Lily!
Stop coming at me!
Water magic!
Fist of Love!
I'm sorry, Asta.
I didn't think about using my magic.
Great, Sister.
No chance.
I did it.
Not yet!
How many times has she already cut you off?
Young man, why are you getting into your own business?
Why?
Because you're a throaty shorty,
a fool for a nose in the ass.
And most importantly, the conqueror of the heart doesn't like you.
Hey!
Is that what you're talking about?
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Is that what you're talking about?
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
It's just a waste of time.
What did you say?
That's enough, Asta.
You can't beat the young man.
Then take this.
Super!
Hey, Asta.
Attack!
You can't use magic.
It didn't work.
I'm not done yet!
Asta is so funny.
I have no abilities.
I can't believe you don't know how to use spells at such a young age.
What the hell? How dare you talk to the elders like that?
Shut up.
In this world, magic is everything.
And its use is quite natural.
And you're the only one I've ever seen who can't use spells.
Then... then I have no choice.
I'll show you my scythe.
Scythe?
What's wrong with you? You can't do it that fast.
And what's wrong with that, you fool?
You're so funny.
Brother Juno, you're so cool.
Great, Juno.
You helped me a lot.
In that case, I'll...
I'll beat you up.
Brother Juno and Asta are the same age, but they're like heaven and earth.
Juno, hope for this church.
You can even become a wizard and serve the magicians.
Asta, the ceremony is coming soon.
When you get your scythe, maybe you'll be able to use magic too.
Sister!
I think so.
I'll get my scythe soon.
Finally. Finally.
I'll have the strongest scythe.
And then I'll be able to become a wizard knight, and then a king of magicians.
You're going to get your scythe.
You're going to get yours again.
And then I'll come back and rebuild this dirty church!
I'm sorry, but it's so dirty and dirty!
Right, Juno?
Right?
You'll see.
Damn it! I'll show it to everyone!
Wait, Asta!
He's definitely older than me.
Say, Yuna, why are you so...
What?
Say, Yuna, why are you so cold with Asta?
Everything has changed.
I remember when you were kids, you were always together.
You used to cry a lot.
But since the day he brought Asta with those terrible wounds,
he hasn't cried anymore.
I can't be nice to him.
And since then, Asta always comes home dirty from head to toe.
I wonder what he's doing there.
994, 995, 996, 997, 998, 999, 1000!
This is the best time for a leafy ointment that increases the power of sorcery!
I will become the king of magicians.
I will never give up.
But in order to achieve this, I need strong muscles!
It's March.
It's the time when the dance is surrounded by ointment seeds.
And one of his children, 15 years old,
gathers in a place where they get their own grimoire,
which enhances their magical abilities.
Wow!
These are all grimoires?
And which one of them is mine?
As soon as I get my own grimoire, I'll be able to conjure up magic!
And finally, I'll catch up with Yuna!
I suppose today I will finally become a full-fledged magician.
Hey, look at that.
So pathetic.
And why give a grimoire such a waste?
Exactly.
Just don't say they think they can pass the entrance exams on the knight sorcerer.
Only nobles born with great magical power or related to the royal family can get there.
Besides, I've heard that that grimoire can't even use magic.
Oh, then we shouldn't even think about them.
Looks like he's the only one in the kingdom who can't conjure up magic.
Welcome, young people.
Today is a different day in your lives.
I wish you all faith, hope and love.
I am the grimoire master of the tower.
There has never been a man in this area who would become the king of magic,
but there have been those who have reached heights as knight sorcerers.
I sincerely hope that one of you will someday become the king of magic.
No, I'm serious!
And now it's time to give you your grimoires.
Grimoire!
That's my grimoire!
Look at that.
That's my grimoire!
That's my grimoire!
Yes.
I'm going to get out of this madness and move to the city.
I'm going to start a business.
That's my grimoire.
That's my grimoire.
I decide what to do after I've tried my grimoire.
In six months, there will be a test on the knight sorcerer.
And we will definitely pass.
All right, all right.
I'll be looking forward to it.
And me?
And where's my grimoire?
Black Kleber.
Released on Anilibria.TV.
And me?
And where's my grimoire?
Well, try it in a year.
What?
What the hell?
What the hell?
That's too funny.
Are you kidding me?
I can't believe it.
It's amazing.
Simple people are really funny creatures.
Black Kleber.
Black Kleber.
The four-leafed one?
The one from the legend?
That's the one who got the first king of the magicians?
A grimoire filled with great power and bringing luck to its owner.
He's a simple man?
Wow.
I will become the king of the magicians.
Cool.
He's the shining star of Heizle.
The young man's brother is amazing.
Oh, cool.
Young man.
Just wait.
I'll catch up with you in a second.
Because I'm your rival.
He said he's his rival.
He doesn't even have a grimoire.
And what does he think?
That's impossible.
So, kids, let's go home and celebrate this day.
Today you can eat three potatoes.
Yes!
You could have eaten something else.
What an amazing thing can be found in such a small town.
I thought that when there would be a grimoire,
I would be able to use magic.
But not to get it at all.
Well, as if I give up because of this crap.
Destiny, don't underestimate me.
You'll see.
Even if it takes one, two, ten, fifteen minutes,
one, two, ten or a hundred years,
I will try until I get my grimoire.
I will become the king of magicians
and show everyone that anyone can achieve this,
whether he is a beggar or an ordinary orphan.
You're all fools.
Just wait, young man.
Hey, you shouldn't have come so far.
Today everyone was supposed to look at us.
And what's the result?
Some beggar gets a grimoire of four-leaf clover?
I'll just...
I'll just burn it to ashes.
He held my flame and didn't even use it in the grimoire.
Do something.
Come on.
I can let you go and burn it.
Don't try to resist.
My magic of creation is connected to an iron chain
that locks a person and seals his magic.
Who are you?
Until recently, I was a well-known knight-magician.
I was called the master of the chain, Le Buci.
But I was kicked out.
And now I'm just a humble thief.
And I'll take this grimoire.
Le Buci, right?
It makes no sense to steal it.
After all, the only one who can use the grimoire
is its owner.
However, there are a lot of collectors in the world
who are ready to pay for them.
Especially for a grimoire with four-leaf clover.
Maybe he chose you.
But you're still an ordinary kid.
You're not lucky enough to meet me on your way.
Your story will end without even starting.
And this clone seems to be quite expensive.
I think I'll take it.
Stop right there!
What the hell are you doing?
I came to...
What the hell are you doing?
Is this a grimoire of Arion?
Where did you get it?
Give it to me, thief!
Aren't you the rat that the grimoire chose?
Oh, you remember me?
Yeah, maybe I'm a pathetic rat.
But the grimoire is a treasure that only one owner has.
Well, give it back to him, young man.
In the adult world, people are not so cruel.
Boy, do you want to die?
Run, Asta!
I'm not going to run away from this terrible destruction!
Not yet!
No, that's it.
The snakes dance in chains!
What a strong blow!
All the magic in the city is so strong.
I've been training my body hard, but it's no use.
What a poor boy!
Not yet. Not yet.
I have to become the king of magic.
You? And the king of magic?
By using these chains, I can determine the level of his magical power.
You don't have a drop of magic.
Maybe you were born like this.
That's why you don't have a grimoire.
I think you don't have enough drops in the world where magic and all that is.
What an invaluable discovery!
What? I can't conjure?
So, no matter how hard I try, I can't use magic?
Just think that there is someone so pathetic.
You won't even be able to find a job and become the king of magic.
I'm more than sure that your gifted friend will also laugh behind your back.
Maybe that's it.
The young man is so amazing that he chose four-leaf clover.
And I...
You won't be able to achieve anything in this world.
All you have to do is give up.
You were born a loser.
Yes, he's right.
No matter how hard you try, there are things that are not for you.
Maybe I should...
Hey!
Who did you call a loser, Astor?
It's true that you won't be able to become the king of magic.
I heard! Even your friend says it's impossible.
Because I will be their king.
What?
He's not a loser to me.
He's...
Astor is my rival!
What? He's your rival?
A rat without a bunch of magic?
Not yet.
I'm sorry for this worthless sight.
Give me a second.
I'm going to get rid of him!
It's...
Grimoire?
I knew it.
Astor couldn't have been chosen.
Your magic?
But there's no magic inside you!
What kind of Grimoire is this?
Three Clever sheets symbolize faith, hope and love.
In the fourth sheet, luck is hidden.
In the fifth sheet, luck is hidden.
In the fifth sheet,
the demon is imprisoned.

Thank you for choosing us.
Thank you.
I'm not going to give up,
just because I can't use magic.
It doesn't matter if you're poor or poor.
Anyone can shine in this world.
