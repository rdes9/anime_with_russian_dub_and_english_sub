        <pre>It seemed that humanity would be destroyed by demons, but one mage was able to save this world.
He was given the title of the King of the Magi, and he became a legend.
In the capital of the Kingdom of Clever began the trials in the knight of the sorcery, the detachments defending the kingdom under the command of the King of the Magi.
In the last trial, each candidate must fight his opponent with the help of Grimoire.
So, let's start!
Don't hold back, okay? Let's make it fast!
The magic of creation, the great bronze Yotroseki!
How do you like my magic? This ball protects me, I can attack without leaving it. Attack and defense, two in one!
The Yotroseki will block your attacks and demonstrate my defensive abilities. And when you're out of breath, I'll finish you off.
Well, attack, don't hold back! Ha ha!
The Black Clever
Anilibria.tv presents...
The Black Clever
The fifth page, the way to the title of the King of the Magi.
The Black Clever
The Black Clever
The Black Clever
The Black Clever
The Black Clever
The Black Clever
The Black Clever
Yes, everything is obvious here.
The boys from the village have no chance.
Damn, I also wanted to fight this shorty.
Well, the Grimoire beat him up.
He doesn't even know how to conjure.
Silly rat.
What kind of squad do you need, guy?
Well, attack, don't hold back! Ha ha!
And now try to make it as exciting as possible.
Of course, as you say.
Quick, that was the��를?
No, that was an incredible physical force.
What?
Oh, come on!
I'm joining, the blackjack deeds.
I'm not here to have a good time and get fired from my job.
I'm here to become the king of the magicians.
This grimoire...
Oh no.
I'm going to beat you.
Asta.
The sword of his magic?
This loser from the village?
What the hell? Who is he?
And what did he say about the king of the magicians?
Hey, shut up!
Yeah, I said I'm going to become the king of the magicians.
What, do you have any problems?
What a jerk.
What the hell is this village doing?
It must be awful to lose to such an idiot.
Get out of the arena, you moron!
Hey, who's there?
Magic of creation.
Amazing.
In the previous tests, he didn't have such a magical power.
And he didn't use magic.
What?
No, he didn't just not use it. He doesn't have it at all.
Then I didn't feel a drop of mana in him.
And despite that, he wants to become the king of the magicians?
Yes.
Looks like we've got a very interesting specimen in our hands.
Hmph.
He's getting stronger and stronger.
And that's true, with such talent and great magical power.
That's so cool!
If you think about it, this shorty was just simply lucky.
That's true.
Most likely, his opponent simply lost his vigilance.
Young man, isn't that right?
Looks like it's hard for you to pick an opponent for yourself.
Maybe you'll fight me?
That's... Salim?
From the famous Habchuskin family.
From the Habchuskin family?
Maybe you were chosen, four-leaf clover, but you're just a black man.
I'll show you how much you're worse than the nobles, both in status and strength.
And of course, in money.
So, let's get started!
The opportunity to fight the great Salim of the Habchus is already a honor for you.
And when you return to your village, you can boast about it for the rest of your life.
I'll show you the difference between us, the rising god of lightning, Salim!
Young man...
I'll even buy you a ticket to your house.
The magic of the wind... Tornado!
The magic of the wind... Tornado!
Salim?
Yes, with one spell!
Are you kidding me?
Awesome!
Amazing, I want to be his friend.
Wow, not bad.
Yeah.
This is the end of our exam.
And now, candidates, whose numbers will be called, take a step forward.
The captain will raise his hand if he wants to see you in his detachment.
Will you step forward or not?
And which of the detachments invited you to choose, decide, it's up to you.
But if no one raises their hand, the path is closed to you as a knight and sorcerer.
And you will leave this place immediately.
Candidate number one, take a step forward.
Yes!
Candidate number 32, no suggestions.
Candidate number 40, no suggestions.
Candidate number 45, no suggestions.
Candidate number 67, no suggestions.
Finally, someone raised their hand!
Cool!
Candidate number 71, purple braids.
Candidate number 78, I will be glad to see him.
I will be glad to see him.
Bagrov and Lev, number 99, Karalova and Pavlin, number 116, no suggestions.
Damn!
Candidate number 141, no suggestions.
Well, basically expected.
I'll just go back to the village.
Oh, it's scary.
Next, number 164.
Yes.
Young man.
Candidate number 141, raise your hand.
What?
Really?
All the captains!
Raise your hand!
Amazing!
I thought that only the people of the royal blood and nobles could enter the Golden Dawn.
Yes, well, even the silver-winged eagle.
But he is an ordinary peasant.
All the captains!
Wow!
I did not expect less!
To become the king of the magicians,
I will go the best way.
I want to enter the Golden Dawn.
Yes, you took the best.
I wanted to be his friend.
Well, you can't do anything.
Number 165.
Oh, and he's next.
I won't let the young man overtake me.
I'm ready!
Candidates, raise your hand.
I don't care where.
Well, anyone, please.
Number 165.
No suggestions.
Black cleaver.
Black cleaver.
Oh, come on.
Hey, come on!
Don't delay the line!
Not yet.
Shame!
No.
I... I...
It's not even surprising.
Yemi?
No matter how good your combat skills are,
if the source of your power is unknown,
no one will want to deal with you.
And finally,
for knights and sorcerers,
the main thing is their magic.
What... What's going on?
Yemi?
How... How does it hurt so much?
So this is the power of the knights and sorcerers.
And since you have no magic at all,
you don't need anyone.
This is the reality.
You said you wanted to become the king of magic,
didn't you?
So you're going to defeat
all nine captains, aren't you?
And now, here,
when I stand in front of you,
you have the courage to say that you will become the king of magic,
even without using magic?
If I can't join the knights and sorcerers today,
no matter how many times I fail,
no matter what others say about me,
someday I will become the king of magic!
You're a busybody.
Come to me.
What?
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
I want you to enter the Black Beak.
By the way, you don't have a choice.
What?
In the Black Beak, you'll make seven circles of hell.
We'll shake the whole spirit, so be ready.
What?
And one day you will become the king of the magicians.
Yes!
Number 512, no suggestions.
The exam is over.
Well done, don't worry.
You'll try in a year.
Asta.
Juno, you're the Golden Dawn, and I'm the Black Beak.
This is where our battle begins.
Yeah, let's see.
Nature calls!
It seems that the fried snake was spoiled.
I can't take it anymore.
Damn it, it's coming out!
Don't make a fool of me.
I don't think it's going to work for you, Asta.
Because of you, I only got a place in one of the lowest ranks,
the Green God.
Now I'm fucking a bug.
And how are you, a guy from some kind of slum,
trying to get into the crown?
Life is not so simple.
Bronze magic of creation.
Poisonous lizard Sekki.
Now your luck won't smile on you.
Eat poison.
If you're unlucky, you'll be a colleague for the rest of your life.
Are you having fun?
Four-leaf clover.
I just wanted to make fun of him.
You know, it's a farewell gift.
I wanted to bet who would be the first to get famous.
Get lost.
Asta, you're not an opponent.
I just remembered, I had one important thing to do.
Say hello to the cats from me.
That's much better.
Oh my God, I got in, got in.
I thought I'd shit my guts out.
And now...
Let's go!
I see you're immortal.
What the fuck took you so long?
There was one very important thing.
It's so long and long.
I'm not talking about that at all.
I don't give a shit about you, you piece of shit.
Let's go, Finral.
Okay.
What is this?
Since you can't fly,
we'll teach you some other transport magic.
Oh, but you can't do magic.
What the hell?
I'm sorry, Captain,
but it's pretty hard to hold a portal like this.
Can't you go through it faster?
What are you talking about?
Practice more, you piece of shit.
Let's go.
I'm so tired.
The Black Bull base.
So this is the Black Bull.
So, cool, huh?
The building is pretty old.
Welcome to us.
Welcome to us.
From today, I'll be...
Great!
I'm Asta from the village of Heich,
and from today, I'm...
Oh, God.
Welcome to the worst of the Knights of the Wonders' squadron in the Black Bull.
The following is the continuation.
The project was announced by anilibria.tv in 2017.

Let's have some fun!
The guy who defeated Yuna.
I'm so impressed, Seki!
Your core, Sekki, has such a cool name!
Ha-ha! Your rising god of lightning, Salim, is not bad either!
Ha-ha!
Sekki, I think we could have become better friends.
Ha-ha!
Impossible...
We did it!
Finally, we've joined the sorcerer's team!
Oh, damn it!
Looks like I'm in some kind of stupid house!
