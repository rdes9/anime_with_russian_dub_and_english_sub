It seemed that humanity would be destroyed, but one magician was able to save this world.
He was given the title of the king of magicians and he became a legend.
This is the black market. It's a little dangerous, but full of useful things.
Oh my God, I made it again.
I see the future.
Oh, this old woman is not a mistake. In any case, stop cooling down here.
Oh, cutie.
The black market is not a place for cute ladies.
Get lost, insect.
Hey, I found something really cool.
Ha-ha, it's ...
Hey, you're ... Ha.
Sekki, ha-ha.
How are you?
My name is Ha-ha, oh, that is, Sekki.
Who?
I handed over the stepping stone to him.
Oh, so you're in a green mule.
He is with such beauties. Wait a minute, are they also in a black mule?
Bastard, I'm so jealous.
In addition, it was because of you that I ended up in a green mule.
Ha-ha, how do you piss me off?

So you go shopping?
Well, today we have a weekend.
It should be great.
But if you have so much free time,
it's better to do business and earn points.
I heard that black bulls have less stars than zero.
Stars? By the way, yes.
For my first task, I got a star from the king of magicians.
Come on, it can't be.
You two did a great job.
Are you serious?
Calm down, Suki.
Ha-ha, ha-ha.
I see, it seems you tried hard for fame.
Ha-ha, and you?
Suki!
Well, one day I got the second star.
Suki!
Suki!
Whore!
My victory!
Run!
Stop!
This old woman!
And in fact, but I think we can trust the guy.
I hope for you.
Ha-ha.
Asta, do you want to take all the glory for yourself?
Bronze magic of creation.
Meteor Sekki.
Wait, a barbarian.
Dear ladies, give me the thief.
I'll deal with him in a moment.
No.
Ha-ha.
Come on, stop.
Try to catch up with me.
Stop, I said.
What?
What?
Excuse me.
It seems to have come off.
Not yet.
What is he doing?
I do not see.
You can not escape.
Damn, here's tied up.
If I do not do anything with this cloud, I will not catch him.
If it is created by magic, then for sure.
Do you think my bandit wind cloud?
You can just break it with an ordinary sword.
What?
You can not escape.
Ha-ha.
Ha-ha.
Your glory will be mine.
This is amazing.
Ha-ha.
Ha-ha.
You are arrested.
He is my prey.
Ha-ha.
This is ...
Ha-ha-ha-ha, finally shut up.
I'll take you with me.
Ha-ha-ha-ha.
What are you like ha-ha?
Poison.
Poison spreads throughout my body.
Hold on.
Ha-ha.
Ha-ha.
I die.
If to think, a long time ago, I also sought to the top.
It's a shame that I'll have to rely on him, but when you've overcome me,
reach the heights instead of me.
My dream is in your hands.
Ha-ha.
It's probably not so bad to die like this.
Ha-ha.
Ha-ha. Ha-ha!
What? Am I still alive?
Ha-ha!
What? What are you...
Don't rush at others. These are important things.
Live and realize your dreams yourself.
Never give up, balda!
Well, this poison is not fatal.
Ha-ha.
It only causes temporary paralysis.
I've put a mask on your leg. Will you be like a new one?
Ha-ha. You should become stronger for our next meeting, Asta.
See you. Ha-ha.
See you. Ha-ha.
At first glance, he's still a child.
But the spirit of this boy is unusually strong.
Hold on tight.
Thank you, knight of the wizards.
Take care, granny.
Be careful. Good luck to you.
Ha-ha-ha.
Ha-ha-ha.
I've never met such a type of magician.
And in general, magicians are not magicians.
Yami chose a truly interesting child.
That's why it's so much fun to change your appearance.
Here you are.
Oh.
What are you doing here, king of the wizards?
Ha-ha-ha.
What? I'm walking around the castle and looking for new magic.
What? You realize your position.
It's rare to meet unknown spells.
No, it's not.
You don't know where and with what magic you'll come across.
You're listening to me.
Now, now, Marks.
Oh.
Oh, and this is not the new one from William's detachment.
Well, okay.
I'm going to continue looking for new magic.
I'll be later.
Wait.
Black Clever.
A novice in the golden dawn of youth.
A candidate who received offers from all the captains at the entrance exam.
In addition to him, there is another novice.
Mimosa Vermillion.
A girl from the royal family.
The first mission is to guard Salima de Hapchus.
We must accompany the son of Hapchus, who serves in the palace of the lords,
to our allies in the kingdom of the heart.
Do you know who Lord Hapchus is?
I only know his name.
It is not known that he is rich, but there are only bad rumors about him.
I'm sure he's worried that his son, who is going to study in the kingdom of the heart,
may be attacked along the way.
But you have a family of quite a few strong magicians.
Apparently, he believes that the knights of the sorcerers will perform better as bodyguards.
The Lord makes very generous donations to the knights of the sorcerers every year.
Therefore, it is difficult for us to refuse him.
Are you against it?
I am not.
We must agree on any task.
This will go in favor of the kingdom of Clever.
Yes, sir, I understand.
Take Mimosa with you.
I'm sure there will be more than enough of them with you.
I hope you will look after the beginners.
Salim de Hapchus lost the final part of the entrance exam to the youth.
As a result, he was unable to become a knight of the sorcerers.
So why was Yuna appointed as one of the bodyguards?
This is my first task.
I'm so worried.
Klaus, Yuna, I'm glad I can work with you.
Yes.
Do not relax, Mimosa.
Yes.
And you too.
I know.
Brave newcomer.
How are you doing, Yuna?
Don't look at me like that.
I chose you as my bodyguard because I wanted to apologize.
I heard you want to become the king of the sorcerers.
How do you know?
You were chosen by all the captains and could join any of the detachments.
I understood this because you chose the golden dawn.
The more you achieve, the faster your name will spread throughout the kingdom.
Yuna, you are the one who wears a grimoire with a four-leaf clover.
Try to make your dream come true.
And then I will be able to boast to my future children that one day I fought the king of the sorcerers himself.
And they will say, daddy, you are so cool.
We still have a lot of time before we get to the queen of hearts.
Could you tell us a little bit about yourself?
But I don't insist.
There is a village called Hedge.
Yes, yes, I heard about it.
This is a village of abandoned lands, right?
I think the legend about the king of the sorcerers who defeated the demons came from there.
It's not just a legend.
A huge skull of a demon still lies there.
Really?
In fact, I was thrown into the church when I was still a child.
I have never seen my parents, and I have no idea who and where they are from.
The church was very poor, but my father and sister took good care of me.
Nothing has happened yet, but I am sure that in the Habchus family there are magicians who possess transport magic.
Why us?
Not considering that we are the only bodyguards.
If this were a real threat to the attack, wouldn't they have put more guards?
This task is too suspicious.
What is it?
These clouds.
A little creepy.
I'll check.
Hey, I didn't give an order.
Damn it.
Mimosa, be careful.
Yes, yes.
Young man, defend the carriage.
I was just about to.
Let me through.
I'm scared.
She's gone!
Yeah!
You saved me. Great job, young man.
I didn't even have time to use my rising god of lightning, Salim.
Now you're even more interesting to me.
Yeah, maybe you can show me your village.
I want to see the place where you were born.
I want to know where you lived to grow up so strong.
Lord Salim, this is out of our way.
After what happened now, we don't know what else could happen,
so we should fly straight to the kingdom.
Regardless of who can attack, you three will protect me, right?
Well, of course.
But, you know, visit the village in abandoned lands...
It will be a small stop.
I'm sure the young man will be glad to meet his friends from the church.
Am I right?
It's none of your business.
Oh, come on.
Oh!
So this is the demon's skull.
It's pretty big.
And on top of that, there's a small tree.
It's pretty big.
And on top of that, there's a statue of the first king of magicians.
I see.
So where's your church?
Over there.
Oh!
Juno!
Welcome back!
Thank you.
You've grown so much.
I haven't changed.
Since I left, it's only been two months.
Really?
Well, yeah.
Your face has grown bigger.
Now you look older.
What brought you here?
During our mission, we stopped for a stop.
And why should we stop in an abandoned village?
Hello, I'm Lily's sister.
I'm Klaus Lunet from the famous Golden Dawn,
headed by Willy Van Janssen.
I'm the mentor of these newcomers.
Hello, Klaus.
Thank you for watching Juno.
I read about you in his letters.
Letters?
What did you write about me?
Oh, come on.
I'm Mimosa Vermillion.
Juno and I are in the same squad.
Yeah, I read about you too, Mimosa.
Oh!
What did you write about me?
Wow, what a beauty.
I'm from the Habchus family.
Son of Lord Habchus and heir of the Habchus family,
Salim de Habchus.
Nice to meet you.
No!
I'm sorry.
I'm just...
It's okay.
It's okay, sister.
Juno!
It's Juno!
How are you, my son?
Welcome back!
What are you doing here, Juno?
Wow, what a form!
It's the Golden Dawn!
Juno's brothers!
Yay!
Hey, where's Asta?
Do you talk to Asta?
No.
You're staying with us for the night, aren't you?
Well...
Unfortunately, we're not staying here.
We have to hurry.
Juno!
Well, we don't have to hurry.
We can stay here for an hour.
Well, that's...
In that case, I'll cook the famous dishes from the Heija potatoes
Juno, stay and eat with us.
You too.
Please, come in.
Wow, what a great church!
I've never seen such a tiny church.
How cute!
Tiny?
Like a dollhouse.
What?
Juno, tell us about the knight's magic.
Yes, tell us!
Tell us!
Why should I go into this little dirty church?

The End
The Heija Sekki seminar, part two.
Again?
Of course, Asta.
You haven't studied all the Heija versions yet.
Your rising star is so cool!
Oh, you know, I'm great.
The front part is especially beautiful.
Great, you're starting to understand the Heija way.
I see, so this is Heija.
Yes, you've mastered Heija since today.
Men are so stupid.
Damn this Juno, he's too insolent for a novice.
I'm your mentor, if you don't listen to me, you'll recognize the anger of my glasses.
