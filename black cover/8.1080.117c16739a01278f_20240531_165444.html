The title of the mage king was given to him, and he became a legend.

The morning for the sorcerer knights begins early, they have to do a lot.
The morning for the sorcerer knights begins early, they have to do a lot.
Cleaning.
Washing.
Oh no, my heart belongs to Lily's sister.
Like this.
Take care of the belly.
Sit.
Like this. Good boy. Here.
You will have to endure even if the beast has almost eaten you, and more.
Captain Yami.
Captain.
You have to wake up Captain Black Clever Yami Sukihira every morning.
Captain, it's morning already.
Go away or I'll kill you.
I'm sorry to bother you, but it was you who told me to wake you every morning.
The sorcerer knights also have to deal with unreasonable requirements.
I wake up again to work so early. The sorcerer knights actually have a lot of work to do.
Wait a minute, what the hell am I doing the same as in the church?
What should the sorcerer knights actually do?
For breakfast, nothing but meat.
Noelle, why don't you help me with the cleaning?
Cleaning? I'm from the royal family.
But you're a beginner.
In my life, I never cleaned and didn't wash.
I found something to be proud of.
We both live in the same house.
I don't want to live in the same house.
I don't want to live in the same house.
I found something to be proud of.
We both live in the same house.
I don't want to live in the same house.
But I'm from the royal family.
Stop repeating it.
Shut up, you insect.
Oh, come on.
What should the sorcerer knights actually do?
What? Are you serious now?
We're protecting the country and its people.
There's nothing more important than this job in the world.
What did you think when you joined the squad?
I'm sorry, I'm going to be the king of the magicians.
I'm going to puke.
It's so lively here in the morning.
Being energetic is great.
I need some of this energy too.
Damn it.
Tell them what the sorcerer knights are doing.
It's an alcoholic.
They're protecting the people or something like that.
You can even get closer to the knights if they put you to protect them.
I see.
You can fight the enemies as much as you want.
And no one will say a word to you if you beat the criminal to death.
What's more important, my sister thinks this job is the best.
You see, isn't she an angel?
And I buy her everything she wants.
But if you dare to touch her with your finger, I'll kill you.
What about you, Finral?
I think this is the best job in the world.
After all, I can save so many beauties.
Of course, I'll tell you.
We're friends.
Charmy?
I've run out of food.
I'm still hungry.
The magic of creation.
The cook is a lamb.
Thank you for the food.
While you're a knight of the sorcerers, you can eat as much as you want.
Ouch!
Well, in general, it's a good job.
One-on-one.
I look forward to our joint mission.
Me too.
That's it.
They're the same guys.
Should I be in this squad?
If you take this and pour it over here, it will turn out so delicious.
Try it.
Thank you, but I'm done.
Well, now you know what the sorcerers have to do.
No way!
Let's go, Magna.
Yes, Mr. Yami.
What happened?
A mission.
A mission?
Can I go?
No.
We can do without children.
This is a very important task for adults.
Okay, we're gone.
Hey, don't destroy everything here until we're gone.
Okay, have fun.
Captain, when you come back, you can fight me.
Come back soon.
I'll be waiting.
Just try to get to dinner.
As soon as I can see Mari, I can't stand it anymore.
Maybe we should go to the...
I mean, to the mission.
Should I be in this squad?
Captain Yami and Magna looked so serious.
What kind of a mission is this?
Damn it.
Very damn it.
Now the two of you...
...are done.
Black Clef.
Now the two of you...
...are done.
Flash.
Two pairs.
Damn it.
I lost.
You look good.
Damn it. This is my salary for six months.
You still have a chance to leave, Magna.
And you also have a chance, Captain.
Very good.
Now on the way back, I can buy gifts for everyone in the village.
Let's do it again.
Mr. Yami.
But you have nothing left.
No money, no clothes.
Right, we're already naked.
No, there's something else.
Hey, old man, let's play again.
And if we win, you'll give us everything back.
And what if you lose?
Oh.
It's yours.
Mr. Yami, it's...
Let's do it again.
I don't think it's a good idea.
Yes, Mr. Yami.
Shut up.
Take advantage of the moment and surpass yourself.
But, you know...
Okay, if you lose, you do what I tell you to do.
Okay?
Do it.
What do you say?
Of course, Mr. Yami will never agree.
I agree.
So do I.
Pray, old man.
You're done.
Who else will pray?
I have to work.
Let's hide.
There you go, good boy.
Eat.
Don't stand there.
Come on, help me.
I'm from the royal family.
Be grateful that I woke up so early.
What?
I thought I was going to die.
You're surprisingly strong.
Of course, I'm training.
Captain Yami and Magna.
I hope they're doing well.
That old man had a royal street flash.
Who would have thought?
He's good.
We're no match for the old man in the safe.
People are strong when they have something to lose.
Hey, you fool.
We're back.
Be happy.
You're going on your first mission.
As knights of the Chiradis.
So, guys, this is your first mission.
First mission?
As knights of the Chiradis.
Which one?
I hope it's worthy of my royal special.
Yeah, I'm proud of that.
You have to hunt wild boars in the village of Soshi.
Wild boars?
Boar!
Boar!
Boar!
Boar!
Kabam!
What kind of a poor job is this?
You call her poor?
I've got wild boars in my bare hands.
Don't underestimate wild boars.
They can attack from anywhere.
Don't make hasty conclusions.
We lost to the mayor of the village of Soshi.
Captain Yami and Magno lost?
How strong is he?
They lost to the cards.
Cards?
He took us by the thread.
And the salary for six months.
What the hell?
They're happy.
And when we had nothing left, we made one wish.
And now we have to deal with wild boars.
They must have appeared somewhere in the village.
Now they're destroying the fields.
Well, I'll be waiting for you.
All right, I'll give them back to you.
I have a question.
What do we have to do with it?
Exactly.
We lost to him, didn't we?
So...
Idiots!
You're asking Mr. Yami to pay for his mistakes?
But...
It's okay.
We're the ones responsible for the mistakes.
Mr. Yami.
Legs in hand and on the move.
Or are you cowards?
We're on our way.
Whatever it is, this is our first task as knights and sorcerers.
I'm already in anticipation.
Do I have to hunt wild boars?
What? Are you still complaining?
I'm not complaining.
It's just...
I can't even control my magical powers.
Should I go at all?
Idiot.
The more you spend, the faster you learn.
Right?
And one more thing.
If anything happens, I'll always fix your mistakes.
After all, I'm your mentor.
Magna, you're a real man.
Stop it, idiot.
You're embarrassing me.
Well, if you insist, I'll let you come with me.
Thank you very much.
Hey, why the hell are you looking at us from above?
Not at all.
So it turned out that you were always under me.
What kind of logic is that?
So, use your magic and take us to the village of Soshi.
Village of Soshi?
Impossible.
What do you mean?
Well, to send you somewhere, I must first mark this place with my magic.
What?
This means that I can't move to a place where I've never been.
You're useless.
Well, if that's the case, let's go to the honeycomb.
Hey, teacher Magna.
Yeah, Asta.
I can't fly on a broom.
Hey.
Yeah, Noel.
I can't either.
Are you both kidding me?
How did you even pass this exam?
Damn it.
It's the basis of the basis.
Well, I don't have any magical powers.
I found something to be proud of.
And I can't control my magic.
It's so hard to understand.
Idiot.
You go there too.
Looks like I have no choice.
I'll give you a ride on my...
...cool baby.
Baby?
Her name is...
Mad Cyclone.
Cool.
Cool, right?
Of course.
Poor thing.
What?
How else?
Poor thing.
What?
Girls, you'll never understand this.
You're not playing.
Poor thing.
Yeah!
We flew!
Hey, how are you there?
The man gave the word, the man will keep it.
Let's go!
Fly!
How do you like it?
Mad Cyclone can withstand even three of them.
Can you fly more carefully?
No.
Hey, don't come near me.
Idiot, don't ask for anything impossible.
Why did you scream?
Yeah!
Wow, Magna!
We're like the wind.
You fool, hold on tight.
Or you'll get hurt.
That's right.
Hey, don't let go of my hand.
What the hell are you doing?
Let me go!
Just in time.
So this is where the magic stone is.
Find it.
Yes, sir.
Disappear in the fog.

Respect.
Well, isn't the crazy cyclone cool?
In general, your hairstyle looks more like a crazy cyclone.
What did you call a cyclone?
I agree with the crazy one.
