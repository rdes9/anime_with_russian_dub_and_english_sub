It was said that humanity would be destroyed by demons and one mage was able to save this world.
He was given the title of the king of the magicians and he became a legend.
So, guys, your first task.
The first task?
Like the knight Richard.
And what is it?
I hope it is worthy of my special queen.
Yes, be proud of it.
You will have to hunt wild boars in the village of Soshi.
Wild?
Boars?
Boar!
What a miserable job!
You call her miserable?
Yes, I will kill boars with bare hands.
Do not dare to underestimate the wild boars.
Legs in hand and on a hike.
Or you are dead.
Calm down.
We're coming.
No matter how it is, this is our first task as knights and sorcerers.
I'm already in anticipation.
I will have to hunt wild boars.
What?
Are you still complaining?
I'm not complaining at all.
It's just that I can't even control my magical powers.
Should I go at all?
Her name is Mad Cyclone.
Cool!
Cool, huh?
Of course.
Poor thing.
The man gave the word, the man will keep it.
Let's go!
Fly!
Wow, Magna, we're like the wind.
Idiot, hold on tight, or you'll break into the cake.
Yeah.
So this is where the magical stones are.
Find it.
Yes, sir.
Dissolve in the fog.

Why are we even doing this?
Why are we even doing this?
Why did Sylvain do this?!
Why did Sylvain do this?!
I-I don't know.
I-I don't know.
I just want to help him!
I just want to help him!
I'll do this.
I'll do this.
I'll do this.
WHAT?
You're done for!
I think I'm done for.
Good job, Asta.
But that's not all.
What a catch!
And you?
You're amazing.
Three or four boars, you know, it's not that easy.
You're strong enough.
The old man will be pleased.
So let's start the party.
Um, the mayor of the village is dry.
Seiche, you're a good boy.
I'm glad you're here.
I'm glad you're here.
I'm glad you're here.
I'm glad you're here.
The mayor of the village is dry.
Seiche, do you know him?
Yeah, we've known each other for a long time.
I'm from the village of Rayaka.
We flew over it.
I was a hooligan when I was a kid.
I was a hooligan when I was a kid.
I was a hooligan when I was a kid.
And what's changed?
When I got my grimoire,
I was so impudent,
and I ran into the village of the dry
to grab it.
And then...
Hooray, hooray, hooray, hooray, hooray!
Get it!
Hey, snot!
What are you doing?
You want to die, old man?
You want to die, old man?
You're the only one who can get rid of the mushrooms here.
You're the only one who can get rid of the mushrooms here.
Catch him!
You'll pay!
You'll pay!
Watch out!
And now...
And now...
What are you going to do?
Punishment time!
Hey, Hooray, stop it already!
Hey, Hooray, stop it already!
Since then, I've called that old man many times.
Since then, I've called that old man many times.
Roar!
Real men
Real men can never hurt
Real men can never hurt other.
Real men can never hurt other.
Play with your strength!
Kolya, this is what you gain by first Lipone!
Kolya, this is what you gain by first Lipone!
real man
Real man will never let the othersheure him
Real man will never let the othersvalve him
Real man will never let the others–≤orry about himself
And he's strong.
Later I found out that old Seihir had strong magic and in his youth also tried to become one of the knights.
And it was he who offered me to try himself in the tests on the knight's charade.
Oh, it seems that during this time you have become stronger.
I've been using my grimoire all the time.
In this case, don't you want to try to pass the test on the knight's charade?
Huh? I pass the test?
You're already quite experienced.
No, it's impossible. I'm just a simple village kid.
Nothing is foreseen.
How should your origin affect anything?
Your future depends only on you.
I'm sure you'll be able to achieve what I couldn't in my time.
Old man.
Be a man, Magne.
So, what does the knight's charade do?
You don't even know that?
If it weren't for him, I wouldn't be here right now.
When I was able to become a knight's charade, he was the happiest of all.
He was a good man.
Yes, and he came to the capital to quickly earn money for his village.
But I think he wanted to see me too.
He poked me in the ass for every little thing.
It was he who showed me what a real man should be like.
I wanted to be like him, the man I respect the most after the pit.
Magne?
What the hell?
Village.
It's surrounded by fog.
Wow, they're not lucky with the climate.
Bullshit. It's magic.
Oh, come on.
Soshi Village.
Magic fog.
Even if we go in there, it doesn't look like we can get where we need to go.
We'll lose direction, and in the end we'll just wander in the fog.
Magic that can cover the whole village.
Not a single resident is capable of that.
It doesn't look like the magic of old Seiki.
What's going on here?
Hey.
Yeah?
Cut the fog with a sword.
Got it.
Don't be silly.
Somehow I have to cut the fog.
Woodpecker.
If it's magic, your sword will cut it.
Oh, yeah.
Hooray, hooray, hooray, hooray, hooray, hooray, hooray, hooray, hooray, hooray, hooray!
Great! It works.
Let's go!
Yeah. To the right.
Got it!
To the left.
Yeah.
I think you know where to go.
Of course. To the left.
Can you feel it?
Yeah. It's...
...powerful magic.
Straight. Be careful.
We have to be on the square.
Yeah!
Damn it.
Fireball explosion!
Riders, get up.
They're gonna save us.
Magna, is that you?
What's going on here?
Old man!
Hey, get up!
Old man!
Our mayor.
He was trying to protect us.
Grandpa, they're here.
Knights of the Chaldeans.
Your prayers...
...are heard.
A man can die so easily.
Bastard!
It's your business.
How dare you break my schedule.
You will be executed in 10 seconds.
Fireball explosion!
Damn it. I'm almost out of power.
Master!
I won't forgive you.
Black Clever.
Why do you need all this?
Who the hell are you?
They don't look like spies...
...or robbers who attacked the village.
Who are they?
We weren't told that there are knights nearby.
Perhaps they have an official mission.
How did they get through our...
...foggy barrier?
Black Beaks.
They walk around like...
...a bunch of wild fireflies among the knights.
Fighting them is an empty waste of time.
Five minutes.
And we'll get rid of useless people...
...who don't know anything.
And we'll keep searching.
Hey, I'm talking to you!
The magic of the fog. Illusory whirlwind.
You're stupid if you think you can...
...get into the fog so easily.
God damn it!
Get out of the fog.
Damn it!
He also cut my ice recently.
I don't know what spell he's using, but...
...his sword can cancel magic.
You can't let him get too close.
I'm asking you, why are you trying to kill...
...all the inhabitants of the village?
This world is divided into several regions.
The noble lands, where the wise live.
The common lands, where the common people live.
And abandoned lands.
The village of Soshi is located in abandoned lands.
The people who inhabit these lands...
...are a lower race, capable only of low-level magic.
Just like animals, they are unable to use tools of labor.
These weak-minded creatures could take my time.
The only bad thing about them...
...is that they don't know how to clear their path.
Animals?
You three are strong enough...
...to become knights of magic, aren't you?
And you came here only because...
...this is one of your tasks.
Don't you consider yourselves...
...dirty pigs?
It must be good to live in the upper lands.
It's a holiday.
Why don't they just go there?
It's not that simple.
Why?
Only strong magicians can live in the upper lands.
And they have a lot of prejudices about us.
Even though we are all human beings.
Well, then I'll become a knight of magic...
...and then a king of magic.
And I'll make everyone equal.
And our village will be the best.
Thank you, Asta.
If people like you were on our side...
...we would have lived like this a long time ago.
What did you say?
Respect the elders!
You will never become a knight of magic...
...except for the king of magic.
You can't even conjure.
Hey!
I live just to...
...protect people like you.
I see.
So these pigs are so important to you.
I can beat them!
That's...
No!
The combination of ice and mana...
...an endless ice cage.
And now...
...will you protect your favorite herd?
I hate the word slow...
...but it seems to me...
...that this will be the most effective.
Asta!
Dissolve.
You can not only dissipate...
...but also reflect magic.
But that's not enough.
I can create ice fragments endlessly.
Try it.
Protect.
Damn you!
My hands and legs are tied to the salvation of the inhabitants.
Not to mention that my mana is at the limit.
And there are four more magicians...
...leveling me below the knight of magic.
And then the cloud still...
...did not reveal all the codes.
Yes, guys.
Your first task was not completed.
Bad our business.
But if I run away now...
...then how can I later consider myself a man?
I'm just as cold as you are.
And I will not hurt you.
Magna!
How long will you last?
You can not even master your magic.
Apparently, in the black bull...
...very hard with skillful magicians.
Rejection after rejection.
Wicked beast.
And you can not protect your skin.
If you run away now...
...I'll let you live, knight of magic.
Not really.
A real man...
...never leaves anyone.
I...
...from the royal family...
...my magic is stronger than the rest.
Back, Noel.
And in the end I just get in their way.
I have no reason to be here.
If you run away now...
...I'll let you live.
Exactly.
I'm the royal blood.
I can not die in such a place.
Need...
...miss...
...Miss Knight, please.
Save us.
This little girl asks me for help.
I must protect them.
Again...
...a spell.
Now I can not.
Just run away.
I must protect them...
...as a member of the royal family...
...and as one of the black bulls.
