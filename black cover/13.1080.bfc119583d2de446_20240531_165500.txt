It seemed that humanity would be destroyed, but one mage was able to save this world.
He was given the title of a mage, and he became a legend.

So that's what famous Heide's potatoes are like.
I'm not sure if you'll like it, Lord Salim, but just try it.
I've never had anything like it, and I'd like to drink it, but it's delicious.
Oh, thank God!
I see. You cook very well, Miss Lily.
That's not true at all.
Please eat as much as you want.
And you too, Klaus Mimosa.
Why does a noble man like me have to eat this unknown food?
Oh, I want to drink it so much.
Yeah, isn't that great?
The young Asta sent us money for their first salary as sorcerers.
And now we can buy enough potatoes to feed Klaus Mimosa.
Didn't you try to feed us something other than potatoes?
Come on, don't show up.
Here, look what Yuna has become after our potatoes.
Yuna, it's great that you send money home, even though you're a novice.
Let's see what Yuna has become after our potatoes.
Yuna, it's great that you send money home, even though you're a novice.
Yuna, thank you for everything.
You've helped us so much.
And not only with potatoes.
We were able to make a hole in the floor.
And even dug a well in the yard.
Thank you, Yuna. Thank you.
Did Asta send money too?
Yeah, I can't believe it.
How much?
I won!
From next month I will send all my salary.
I didn't think it was worth it.
We have enough that you send us money.
I appreciate it.
I'll send it.
Really? Thank you.
Lord Salim, we should be on our way.
But nothing will happen if we stay here a little longer.
It will be useful for future nobles to learn more about our world.
Miss Lily, can I have some more water?
Of course.
Oh, it's empty.
I'll go get some.
Let me.
It's okay.
Take a rest, Yuna.
Well, one moment.
Night.
It's pretty cold at night.
Thank you very much.
And you, gentlemen?
Oh, it's empty. It's just a habit.
Just an ordinary nobleman etiquette.
Yuna!
What happened?
Where's your sister?
It's all in the past.
The same people attacked Lord Salim.
What a horror!
Of course, it should be the same.
It's not a horror.
It's not a horror.
What a horror!
Of course, it should be because she was in my dress.
Instead of me, they grabbed Miss Lily.
Yes, it seems so.
Sister, will everything be okay?
Yuna!
Yuna!
Don't worry.
I won't hurt her.
Yuna, I'll go too.
I'll go too.
I'll go with you.
No.
Stay here.
Everything will be fine.
Wait.
Our task is to escort Lord Salim.
And we don't know when the enemy will come for him again.
We need to go.
Sister!
Hey, four-eyed!
How can I help you?
Four-eyed?
Klaus?
Don't interfere, Mimosa.
Yuna, I know you're worried about her,
but we have to leave her in search of the authorities who have a jurisdiction here.
We're leaving immediately.
Please, Lord, Yuna, Mimosa.
Yes.
Yuna.
No.
We must complete the task of disobeying this crime.
Despite that, I'll save her.
Yuna!
How dare he!
You'll be a man of your word, Yuna.
You know my name?
Now, take this!
Mecha!
Tornado.
What?
I'll kill you!
I'll kill you!
I'll kill you!
I'll kill you!
I'll kill you!
Get down!
The first one is ready.
There are four left.
I'm not going to kill you,
but I'm not going to let you go just like that.
I see.
So you've been following me all this time.
Mecha!
And what do you think I am?
You can't breathe?
Dive!
And how is this magic supposed to drown me?
It...
That's how it is.
You need to drown.
I'll kill you!
The second one is ready.
Oh, I never thought this would be like that.
Looks like you hit my trap.
Take this!
Not bad.
So well, why don't you try to shut up?
Glück زke.
Whats wrong with you?
Hence why people are so much concerned against size.
Shut the hell up.
It's late.
That was just the third one.
Two more.
Sister, where are you standing?
Good boy.
It would be bad if such a cute face burns out.
Black Clever
Yuna, it seems that you have a talent for magic.
If you see that someone is in trouble, be sure to help him.
Promise.
What did you say?
Well, Yuna, why not give you your Grimoire?
You can't do anything without it.
Why do you need it?
Maybe I'll sell it, or maybe I'll burn it.
In fact, I don't care.
The main thing is that without your Grimoire, you are useless as a knight of magic.
You are achieving this.
What if I refuse?
You will refuse.
That's it. Good boy.
I'll let you take your precious sister home.
I refuse.
Kova, why don't you catch up with your sister?
You can't touch her with your finger.
Do you want to attack me?
Then, in any case, I wasn't going to attack her.
Then how?
Steel magic of creation.
Mimosa?
Yes.
She's fine.
I hope the rest are dead.
Except for one.
Ran away?
What would you do if I wasn't here?
Why did you come?
Are you holding me for a fool?
Answer me.
Listen, young man.
Our duty as knights of magic is to protect people.
I thought it was strange.
Those people attacked you, not Salim.
Do you think the nobleman would visit such a village?
Do you think he would enjoy eating this potato?
I'm sorry, but I wouldn't do that.
They couldn't accidentally kidnap Lili's sister instead of Salim.
Besides, it's strange that Salim, who you defeated at the qualifiers, agreed to be accompanied by you.
And then we used my magic to create plants.
Is the flower true?
It's all your fault, young man.
Because of you, I couldn't become a knight of magic.
Don't worry, you stupid four-leafed grimoire.
I'll take it from you.
I'll make my father take revenge.
I'll take revenge.
He told you everything.
I'm still surprised that you were able to find me.
This is one of Mimosa's abilities.
The magic of creating plants.
The magical flower.
Let's see.
Oh, here it is.
And that's why we were able to arrive on time.
Thank you.
I couldn't do it without you, Klaus.
Mimosa.
You're welcome.
Shut up!
Is it true revenge?
I'm so sorry.
Now it's clear why you lost, young man.
And why our honorable captain of the Golden Dawn, William Wanjas,
chose him.
That means he's really talented.
Klaus...
Don't get me wrong.
I still haven't recognized you.
Yeah.
This time I'll forgive your impudence.
Salim is to blame for everything.
So, what do we do?
Take him to the capital?
No.
We'll just leave them here.
Are you sure?
And let him at least try to get closer to the village of Hedge.
You heard him.
You're free.
Don't try to come up with such a thing.
Is that clear?
You're just a human.
To put your vigilance to sleep was part of my plan.
Huh?
The rising...
The water magic of Salim!
The strike of purification of love!
Enough!
Confess your guilt!
And you too!
Yes!
I was thinking of inviting my sister to our detachment.
Yuno,
we still have to take them to the capital.
By the way,
where did the other one go?
Huh?
There you are.
That was fun.
If they had real problems, I would have saved them,
but it turned out that there was no need for that.
Newbie William is pretty good.
How much longer are you going to be a fool?
Don't shout like that.
We need to go back now.
You have a lot of work to do.
Okay, okay.
And all the time to be nervous is harmful to health.
Whose fault is it?
Thank God!
So you're okay!
Thank God!
Hooray!
Surprising, as always.
Well, he's a knight of magic.
Klaus, Mimosa,
thank you very much.
No need for thanks.
If Salim was behind this,
then this is our fault.
Please,
help yourself.
I will repay your gratitude with my potatoes.
It's a little cold, but please eat as much as you want.
Not bad.
You're not very clean with yourself, Klaus.
Delicious.
A star?
The king of magic was pleased with your work
and awarded us with a star.
Thank you very much.
It's an honor.
I would never have thought that I would get a star for my first task.
But it seems to me
that we did not do enough to get a star.
After you brought Salim,
he confessed
to the crimes committed by Lord Hapchus.
bribery, fraudulent accounts, doubtful deals.
Good catch.
And all thanks to you.
Did you really agree to this task
because you knew about it in advance?
We should not allow such a thing
in the kingdom of Clever.
Yes.
Klaus, Juna, Mimosa,
I look forward to your future feats.
Yes.
Juna and Mimosa.
It seems that the newcomers this year
are at least a little competent.
I count on you,
especially on you,
Juna.
Star,
this time it all ended well,
but Juna,
do not dare to be self-willed anymore.
Yes.
What was that pause?
Juna, look at me.
Look me in the eye and say that this will not happen again.
Yes.
Juna.
Hey, Juna.
What?
Golden dawn!
I got another star!
We are all people.
I thought we finally reduced our gap to a hundred,
but they have one more again.
Damn it,
I thought we finally caught up with them.
It was close.
In what place is it close?
We have minus 30 of them.
We are all people.
Shut up.
I will not lose.
They have only 101 more,
I will catch up with them soon,
so you will see the golden dawn.
Juna!
Juna!
Master,
we have a problem.
It's a strange situation, isn't it?
Well,
calm down.
I have someone on my mind.
Someone?

Mini Clever
My pony.
Isn't he beautiful?
These eyes,
this nose,
perfect.
Yes.
It's like he's shouting
the golden dawn.
Yes.
Wow, that's cool!
What is it?
It's as cool as the crazy cyclone Magne
rising star.
Really?
I have no idea who you are,
but thank you.
Impossible.
What?
Explore the underworld?
With stupid lacquer?
Where?
Leave it to me.
I don't need your help.

Never give up.
This is my magic.
