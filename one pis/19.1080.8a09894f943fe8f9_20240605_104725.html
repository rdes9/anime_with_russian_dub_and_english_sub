Look for them!
I left them all there!
In pursuit of their dreams, people went to the Grand Line!
The great era of pirates is now entering!

What is it?
That's a huge thing.
What is it?
I found it in the room!
It's not a heart attack.
I think we could practice using our heavy, well-deserved cannon.
Then give it to me.
I think I'm three times.
I've traveled half the world on top of the cannon core.
But how can I use it?
Listen to me!
Hey, Zora, do you know how to use it?
He's been sleeping for a long time.
It's not cool.
A little further south there is a great place for training.
Really?
Really?
Come on, come on!
Hey, you can shoot from a cannon as well as I can.
People call me a cannon master.
Listen!
Episode 19
The past of three swords.
The oath of Zora and Kuina.
Who's there?
Who's there?
I'm Dojo Yaburi.
Who's strong here?
Come out and fight me.
And often you can meet Dojo Yaburi in these days.
Hey, don't underestimate me just because I'm a child.
I'm not equal in the neighborhood.
Great!
Hey, Zora, do you know who I am?
I'm Dojo Yaburi.
Do you know who I am?
I'm not equal in the neighborhood.
Great!
We accept your challenge.
If I win, I'll take your badge.
And if you lose?
I'll lose.
If this happens, maybe I'll join your Dojo.
It's coming.
Then...
Kuina!
Yes, father.
What the hell?
Is there no one else to fight here?
Although Kuina is a girl.
She is stronger than adult fighters in this Dojo.
And this is not a hoax of a father to his daughter.
Okay.
Then come in, please.
I can use one of these things.
As you wish.
So, let's get started.
Yes, go and look for me.
Look for me.
Bow to the gods.
He's a fool.
Bow to the opponent.
Let's get started.
Damn it!
Huh?
You have two sword techniques?
No idea.
Today I for the first time hold a shinai.
For the first time?
Damn it!
I'm stronger.
And I'll become stronger.
How?
How can I lose to girls?
Why didn't he turn around?
Bow!
Done!
This guy looks like a pig!
Hey, Queen!
A poiser like you won't learn to control two swords in ten years!
What?
What?
You want to start the next round?
Damn!
Defeat is defeat!
Okay, very honest confession.
So,
Okay, I'll join your dazio.
Anyone against?
I don't.
I will!
Continue, continue, continue to train!
And I'll beat you!
Remember this!
This will never happen!
I'll beat you!

It's over.
The win of Queen!
2800 wins, not a single defeat!
Kri와清 crushed
Damn it!
You're weak as always, Zoro.
How can you be so weak?
You're a man.
Zoro is not weak, right?
He is the strongest among the other students.
He even beats the adults.
However, he is weaker than me.
Even with two swords.
The weak one is the weak one.
The losing dog should be silent.
He looks more pathetic when he talks about it.
You lost again.
Zoro, you've become much stronger.
Sensei, you don't do it on purpose because she is your daughter.
It's not fair.
Of course not. I don't do anything like that.
It's true. Zoro has become stronger.
However, Kuina has also become stronger.
Zoro! Zoro!
I'm going to take a shower.
Damn it!
Why can't I beat Kuina?
Why? Why?
I'm going to be the strongest man in the world.
Why?
Tonight I'm going to challenge her again.
Zoro has achieved incredible success here.
He practices much more than the others.
The results of his classes are quite predictable.
However, he still can't beat Kuina.
A huge obstacle is on the way.
A huge obstacle is on the way of female fencing.
Under the current circumstances, I can't pass her to Zoro.
Father!
Kuina-san!
It's not good to eavesdrop, Kuina.
To prove to you, I will become the greatest fencer in the world.
Kuina!
Woman!
You can't be the best fencer in the world.
Zoro!
What are you doing here?
I want to ask you about it.
What are you doing here at this time?
I came to have our first fight in 2001.
This will be our last fight.
Let's end it here.
Fight me with a real sword.
You have a real sword, right?
With me?
Great!

Park Ky- marking
With special moves, it's not really impossible for anyone else for that
I will go with Tsunosuke
And stop fighting
Two real swords have to be heavy.
Looks like you're still not strong enough.
Shut up!
This is my 2001 victory.
Damn it!
Damn it!
I can't accept this!
Sometimes I want to cry because I can't accept this.
Girls,
when you grow up, you become weaker, men.
You'll probably surpass me soon.
You always say you'll become the best fencer in the world.
My father told me that.
It's impossible for a woman.
I know.
I already know that.
But I can't accept it.
Zoro, it's probably good to be a man.
I also want to become the best fencer in the world.
My chest is starting to grow.
If only...
If only I was born a boy.
How can you say such words after the victory over me?
You deserve the contempt.
You were my goal all this time.
Zoro, it doesn't matter if you're a man or a woman.
You'll say that the day I beat you.
Like, it's not because of my abilities.
It will make me a hard-working, trained, perfect fool.
Don't say such things.
Promise me.
One day, one of us will become the greatest fencer in the world.
We will compete to see who of us will achieve this.
You're stupid. You say such things even knowing how weak you are.
We swear.
Amazing.
She doesn't even seem stronger than before.
I must strengthen my endurance.
To the point where I can grab as many swords as I want.
If two are not enough, I will use three.
What's wrong with you?
Huh?
Kuina...
Kuina is dead.
She lost her balance on the stairs in the storage room.
Huh?
In the storage room?
It looks like she went there to look for a sharp stone for the sword.
Why did she need it?
Who knows?
She was just a child.
It's hard to understand people.
Who knows what will happen tomorrow?
Kuina...
Kuina...
Kuina...
Kuina...
Kuina...
Kuina...
Kuina...
Kuina...
Kuina...
Kuina...
Kuina...
Kuina...
Kuina...
Kuina...
Kuina...
Kuina...
Kuina...
Kuina...
Kuina...
Kuina...
Kuina...
Kuina...
Damn!
You are really fragile, Zoro.
Queen.
This girl hated defeat.
Since she was a child, she has been training in this field,
achieving skills that allow even adults to win.
Therefore, she became self-confident.
And at that time, Zoro,
you appeared before us.
I sincerely thank you.
In order to beat you and become stronger day by day,
she trained even harder.
She did not want to lose to a boy like you.
And so she began to overcome obstacles that prevented her from becoming a comrade.
After all, I am an ordinary father.
Even now, when I look at you,
my heart shrinks from pain.
Sensei,
please give me this sword.
Queen.
I will take part in her skill and become even stronger.
I will become so strong that my name will spread to heaven.
I will become the strongest infector in the world.
We swore.
I...
I...
Yes.
Good.
The soul and dreams of Queen.
I leave them to you.
8 years later
8 years later
It's been 8 years.
You're finally going on a trip.
Yes, Sensei.
To fulfill my promise.
Zoro!
Take care of yourself.
5 years later
Hey, I missed.
What are you doing?
Practicing shooting from gun.
But it's harder than I thought.
I told you I'd show you how to do it.
So, from this distance...
And that seems to be right, huh?
Fire!
Wow!
You shot him down with one shot.
The target is really on fire.
Of course, he's talking about aiming, I know everything, now you believe?
Yes, yes! From this moment on, you're canon!
What? I'm not the captain?
I'm the captain!
Okay, I'll let you handle this position.
However, if you don't handle it, I'll put you down.
Great!
And while I'm thinking, before we get to the Grand Line, we have to fill in another vacancy.
That's right, we have such a good kitchen.
If you pay me, I'm ready to take over this place.
This is a very necessary member of the team in long-distance swimming.
True, this is the one who must be on the pirate ship.
Musician, are you an idiot?
What are you thinking about?
I thought you were really going to offer something special.
But the pirates have to sing.
Come out, pirates!
What is it?
Who are you?
Shut up!
It doesn't matter who I am!
Come out!
How many of them are there?
I think one.
Then he'll handle it himself.
I killed countless number of pirates.
But you, unknown pirates, dared to try to kill my partner?
This voice, what do you mean?
I have no idea what's going on.
Don't break our ship!
No!
It's hopeless!
What was that?
Hey, man!
Are you Johnny by any chance?
You pronounce my name without respect!
Zura Aniki!
So it's you, Johnny!
Why are you here, Aniki?
Where is Yosaku?
We're not together!
What?
