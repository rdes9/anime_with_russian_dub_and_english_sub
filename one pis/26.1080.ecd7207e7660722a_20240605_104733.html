EPISODE 26
Episode 26
And again there is no translation.
Your division, huh?
Nin!
It doesn't matter how famous he was before.
Now he is an ordinary cook.
It's not a problem to take his head off now.
You want to save this man, don't you, Sanji-san?
Then listen to me and leave the ship.
I didn't want to kill you.
Leave this ship?
Not at all!
You look so pathetic, old bastard.
In such a state, you can't order the cooks to fight, can you?
I don't want to hear all this crap from a small eggplant.
As if you called someone a small ass!
Stop talking to me like a child!
Damn it, Sanji!
He's not going to leave the owner!
Gin!
Send this gun to me.
Are you an idiot?
He'll kill you!
Maybe.
Sanji-san, why?
If you are so thirsty for death, let me honor you.
I owe you for my nose.
Now don't move.
If you don't want your owner's head to get hurt.
The best killing technique!
A gift for the ship!
Sanji!
Why didn't you turn around?
If I did that, he would have let the chicken go.
Why are you doing this?
If you only refused to leave the restaurant, everyone would have been saved.
It's so simple!
This restaurant is the treasure of this old man.
I took everything from him.
His strength.
And his dreams.
So now...
I don't want this old bastard to lose anything!
Sanji, be careful!
Barrel...
Cross!
Sanji!
Old Blue?
Yes, the legendary sea!
It's somewhere around here.
I'm sure of it.
Are you stupid?
Of course, it's only a legend.
Right.
Like a cook in the sea.
Even we would like to see that sea at least once.
Yes.
I'll definitely find that sea someday.
You'll find it, Sanji.
First of all, do you even know where it is?
Of course I know.
Don't think I'm deaf.
East Blue, West Blue, North Blue,
and South Blue.
This is the sea where all the fish of all these seas swim.
This is Old Blue.
It's an unattainable paradise for a sea cuckoo.
It's my dream!
Don't joke, because you'll find all the ingredients of the world in this one sea.
This is exactly what our cooking skills will be useful for.
Yes.
Some people don't spare their lives to find this sea.
It's sad that it's not there.
It can't exist.
Old Blue is such a wonderful sea.
If you slow down and think about it, you'll understand.
Only those cooks who sleep on the go think about this crap.
Well, it's time to end this stupid conversation.
Go to the plate, Sanji.
Oh my God, how many waste?
There's so much food left.
They didn't even touch this plate,
despite the fact that I put a lot of effort into it.
The customers have a certain lack of appetite these days.
No one should eat up these food.
I just got rid of those that were spoiled.
From this point of view, only half of this normal person can sleep on the go.
Don't forget that we are sea cooks.
You can never predict what will happen in the sea.
You don't want to be caught up in bad weather, do you?
Tell me, what about this?
For nothing!
Gentlemen, calm down! Please calm down!
Pirates!
Pirates!
Pirates?
This ship!
These are pirates!
This is Zef's ship with a red leg!
Is he coming back from the ground line?
Are you the captain of this pirate ship, Zef the Red Leg?
What are your intentions?
Brothers!
Robbery!
Take everything away!
Shit!
I can't let them kill me!
These cutters can't kill me!
What's wrong with this kid?
Hey, kid!
This thing is dangerous, don't swing it!
See, I'm bleeding!
See, I'm bleeding!
This is a serious threat to life!
Shut up!
Do you think I'll let you kill someone like you?
Sanji!
This is too dangerous!
Don't be angry with them!
This kid really wants to die!
Kill him, finally!
As if I'm going to die!
If you're going to hurt me, then I'll kill you first!
Sanji!
Great, captain!
The wall ran away!
Maybe I can die!
I...
Maybe I can reach Old Blue one day!
He said Old Blue?
What an idiotic dream!
Tell him, captain!
He doesn't even exist on Grand Light!
Idiot!
He still hasn't pulled it out of his head!
In such a place, I can't...
In such a place, I can't kill myself with these pirates!
Captain, we're leaving!
The storm is getting even stronger than last time!
Very well!
Load all the loot onto the ship!
We're leaving!
Sanji!
Sanji!
Captain!
Damn kid!
Captain!
Why is he so worried about this kid?
I don't know!
I don't know!
Captain!
Why is he so worried about this kid?
Captain!
Captain!
Captain!
Captain!
Captain!

Episode 1
You finally woke up, you coward!
Pirate!
You shouldn't move!
Did you think it was a piece of cake that you got hit?
Where's the ship?
Who knows?
Pirate!
I wouldn't be surprised if he went to the bottom with such a storm.
We're the only ones here.
There are no plants or animals on this rocky island.
You can think about catching fish,
but if you go down, you won't be able to come back.
You don't want to cry from the perspective of dying like a rat.
It's all your fault!
I'll kill you!
Stop whining!
We can wait for help,
otherwise you'll lose all your strength and just turn into a skeleton.
Skeleton?
Me?
In this bag is your share.
If you eat as usual,
then this should be enough for you for five days,
so think about how to spend it better.
It's good that we both roll with you, right?
Wait!
Is that your share?
Isn't it more?
At least three times.
Of course.
I'm an adult.
My stomach is much bigger.
Say thank you that I shared something with you.
Don't expect me to feel sorry for you.
I'm an adult.
Don't expect me to feel sorry for you.
You're old shit!
You wait on the other side.
If you notice the ship,
immediately tell me about it,
but until then we shouldn't communicate with each other,
because we shouldn't waste our strength and we should pray.
Why old shit?
If the ship comes,
then I'll report everything to him as if I ran away.
I read everything.
I have enough food for five days.
During these five days,
at least one or two ships should pass,
but maybe not even one.
So maybe I need to divide it into 20 days?
If I hold out 20 days,
the ship will definitely come.
I will succeed.
I will definitely be saved.
It's easier than simple.
Today is not the only day, right?
It's okay.
They will come on the second or third day.
I don't want to die.
The last loaf of bread.
It will be better to eat it.
Oh my God!
What kind of waste is this?
What kind of waste is this?
What kind of waste is this?
What kind of waste is this?
What kind of waste is this?
What kind of waste is this?
There are so many waste here.
Nobody should eat these waste.
I just throw out what I wasted.
Tell me, what about this?
Never!
Never!
Never!
Never!
Never!
My last loaf of bread!
This old man...
This old man...
I wonder if he's dead.
He's still alive.
Moreover, his body...
There's so much left.
There's so much left of food.
It doesn't matter how I take it.
It doesn't matter how I take it.
I will take it.
I will take it.
I will take it.
I will take it.
It doesn't matter how I take it.
It doesn't matter how I take it.
It all started because of him.
It all started because of him.
I want to survive.
Why are you here, little eggplant?
Maybe you saw a ship?
I came to take your food.
I came to take your food.
If you're going to kill me,
let's do it now.
If you're going to kill me,
let's do it now.
Without food, I'll die anyway.
There's so much left for me.
I thought we wouldn't talk to each other
until one of us sees the ship.
Until one of us sees the ship.
What is it?
It's just jewelry.
It's just jewelry.
Money is not food.
Money is not food.
Funny, can't you find it?
Funny, can't you find it?
Funny, can't you find it?
Hey,
Hey,
this bag is full of jewelry.
This bag is full of jewelry.
What the hell?
What's going on?
What about the food?
You haven't eaten anything yet?
Hey, say something!
What's that?
What happened to your leg?
It was then!
It was just a dream. You saved me.
You gave me all the food you had?
Exactly.
You can't be a pirate without a leg, do you understand?
I think you're right.
Why? You shouldn't have been.
I don't remember asking you to take care of me.
Why?
Why?
You have the same dream as I do.
All Blue...
But...
Even your team said it didn't exist.
But it does exist.
When the time comes, go to the Grand Line.
All Blue is definitely there.
Of course, I can't be a pirate anymore.
So go there and find him.
Hey, old man, don't die!
Don't be a spider, die in front of me!
This sea...
It's amazing how many people cursed the vastness of this sea and died.
I'm still suffering from hunger.
I was thinking about myself.
It would be nice if there was a restaurant somewhere in this boundless sea.
A restaurant?
Yes!
If nothing bothers me, I swear I'll build my own restaurant.
Yes! I'll help you, just don't die!
Don't die!
It's impossible for a weak bug like you!
I'll get stronger!
Just don't die!
Hey!
Save us!
Old man!
Save this old fool!
Damn it!
He sacrificed his life so that I could live.
So did I.
If I don't sacrifice my life, I won't be able to pay off this old man!
Why? Why are you getting up, Sanji-san?
Even if I can extend the life of this restaurant just for a moment...
You fool!
Are you trying to kill him?
Damn it, kid!
Another thin line.
But now this restaurant will finish its work.
From this moment on, it will be a pirate ship.
You fool! Stop! Don't you dare to hit me!
What did this guy think?
Go-go-go-go-go!
Go-go-go-go!
