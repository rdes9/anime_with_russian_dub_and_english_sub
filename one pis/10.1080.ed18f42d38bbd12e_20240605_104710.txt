You don't need them, I'll give them to you.
Look for them, I left them all there.
In pursuit of their dreams, people went to the Grand Line.
Now the great era of pirates is entering the world.

We are! We are! We are the girls!
We are!
What's that?
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine. They heard how big I am and came to enter my pirate ball.
Yeah, but that's not true.
They came to ask you for a loan.
A loan? Me?
Yeah, we need a big ship.
Hey, you there! What are you doing here?
Kurokhodol!
Did you get it?
And did you fix the debauchery here?
Michael Jackson is coming and coming...
Who's there?
Episode 10. The greatest man with weird things. Django the hypnotist.
I'm sorry. Kurokhodol, these people...
Don't say anything.
I'll listen to your explanations later.
And now I'd like you all to leave this place immediately.
Or do you want to say something?
Well, we're looking for a ship.
No way!
Usopp-kun!
Oops!
I've been hearing rumors about you all the time.
You're very famous in this village.
Are you serious?
So you've faced all kinds of dangers before.
In such a young age, this is really an achievement.
You can call me Captain Usopp.
It will help spread my name everywhere.
Captain, huh?
I even heard a story about your father.
What?
Kurokhodol, stop it right now!
You're just a low-ranking pirate's son!
You're just a low-ranking pirate's son!
Even though you're very predictable.
Still, please stop missing our ladies.
You called my father low-ranking?
You belong to a completely different world than our ladies.
Do you want money?
How much do you want?
Enough, Kurokhodol!
Apologize to Usopp-san now!
Hey, Kaya, it's risky.
Why should I apologize to this barbarian?
I just told the truth.
I sympathize with you.
You must be full of hatred.
Hatred for your crazy father
who left you and your mother
to hunt for treasures as a pirate.
Kurokhodol, you bastard!
Stop insulting my father!
Usopp-san!
Why are you so worried?
In such situations, you should just do what you do best,
and that's a lie.
Just say that you have nothing to do with your father
or that he is not my father at all.
Shut up!
Captain!
Did you see that?
He immediately got angry.
He said that the apple falls from the apple not far away.
Shut up!
I'm proud that my father is a pirate.
Being a brave warrior of the sea, I am very proud of him.
Despite the fact that I am a simple,
stale cheater,
remember that I am a pirate's blood.
Such pride is impossible to just fake,
because I am the son of a pirate.
Captain!
Pirates are warriors of the sea, aren't they?
You're pretty naive if you don't have such an ideology.
What?
But that proves that you have barbarian blood in your veins.
You like to lie,
and you get angry when someone hurts you.
Your ultimate goal is to possess the state of our Lady.
That's why you are mistaken about her.
What did you say?
I said that you have a hidden motive.
At least the fact that your father is a pirate is enough proof.
You insulted him again.
Stop lying to yourself.
Please, don't get angry again.
Kurokado is a good man.
He's just...
He's just doing it for me.
To protect me.
Get out of here.
And don't even think about getting close to this house again.
I got it.
I would leave even if you didn't tell me that.
I will never come back here.
Usopp-san.
This bastard is a stupid apicon.
Our captain is not that kind of person.
That's right.
He's a pirate.
Why are you getting involved in everything that's going on?
What did you say, you bastard?
Let me go.
What the hell?
Stop it.
If you don't like something, go and fight me.
Go.
You.
Everyone, get out of here.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
It's time to eat your meal, Midwife.
I don't want to.
I don't feel like eating.
You'll break a chef's heart, by saying it.
Take care of your poor health,
He has been working hard on this for a long time.
Why did you say such cruel things?
I know, it's my fault that I saw Susub-san without your permission.
But you shouldn't have said that.
Can I sit down?
Come on.
Three years have passed.
Since I came to this house,
I still can't forget what happened that day.
A few years later
At that time, I was allowed to be late and was thrown out of the ship on which I worked.
Without work and without money, I was on the verge of death.
And you, get out of here!
This is not a place for people like you!
I'm sorry.
Master, but...
I see. We'll take care of him now.
For me, your late father saved my life.
And you, his precious daughter.
Speaking with you now, I realize that I could have been on board.
However, this guy Susub, he is a bad person.
If, if something happens to you...
How can I look your father in the eye, who picked me up?
For what happened recently, are you still angry at me?
No, nothing like that. I am very grateful to you, Kurokhodol.
But please, don't lie.
Susub-san is a very good person.
About whether he is a good person or a bad person, the question is controversial.
Kurokhodol, you have very narrow views.
Yes, I like to have a narrow view.
Everything is walking.
Hey, where did Luffy go?
I have no idea. Maybe he went with that captain?
The captain should be there.
Yeah, on the shore.
Every time he gets worried, he goes there.
Do you want to go and check?
No, I'm a pass.
By the way, guys, didn't you lose your friend?
Ah, Tamanegi.
Yes, he is always with us.
Yes, and then he appears with screams from somewhere.
It's terrible.
See, a man walking behind.
A very strange man is walking behind.
You're lying, it's true.
Look.
Hey, who was that?
Who is that guy who called me strange?
I'm not strange.
I think you look like a man with strangeness.
It's ridiculous.
I'm just a passing hypnotist.
Hypnotist?
Wow, can you show us something?
Yes, show us something.
What?
You must be laughing.
Why do I have to show off my hypnotism?
I just met a bunch of weirdos.
Look here, just look at this ring.
Nevertheless, he does it.
After I say one, two, django, you will fall asleep.
Got it, I'm starting.
One, two, django.
Hey, what does it mean?
Hey!
So where are you?
It's just that you...
Couldn't you say hello normally next time?
What's wrong?
What do you want?
Nothing.
Just like that.
Damn it.
How dare he insult my father?
Yeah, I didn't like him either,
but I was a great pirate,
so they wouldn't talk about him.
Isn't that right?
In our pirate age, my father swam around the seas
without knowing what was waiting for him ahead.
I'm really proud of myself.
However, this bastard dared to trample on this pride.
I won't forgive him for that.
Well, aren't you going to go to this lady anymore?
I don't know.
If that bastard comes to me
and asks me nicely, I'll think.
That bastard?
Yeah, that bastard.
That bastard, why is that bastard here?
Your division hurts.
Hey, django.
I told you not to attract attention to yourself
in this village.
Nevertheless, you slept in the middle of the road.
That's ridiculous.
I didn't attract any attention.
And I'm not strange.
And what kind of weirdo is he?
I've never seen him before.
Who is he?
So, are the preparations for the operation over?
Of course.
We can start any time.
Operation on the murder of the lady.
He said murder?
Don't talk about murder.
That sounds unpleasant, django.
Oh, yes.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Oh, django.
Oh, yes, it was an accident.
It was an accident.
Hey, what are they talking about?
Quiet!
I would like to know it myself.
We can't just kill her.
Lady Kaeya died in an accident.
Don't forget that.
In any case, we are waiting for your signal
to attack the village
and kill Lady Kaeya, right?
How can you get her inheritance?
You're a fool!
Can you think with your brain?
How can a stranger get her inheritance?
Do your best!
There will be no fish without work, right?
Listen, this is the most important part of the plan.
Before we kill her,
you have to hypnotize Kayu
so that she can write a will.
In this will, she leaves everything
to Kurohado.
This will be the first step
of my plan to get a huge fortune.
This is brilliant!
I spent three whole years
to gain public trust.
So no one will be suspicious
that she will leave me everything.
Just for this,
you became an opekun for three years.
You surprised me so much then,
Captain Kuroh.
Three years ago,
I told you that you would throw
the pirate craft.
You made one of your subordinates
a scapegoat,
so that the whole world would think
that Captain Kuroh was executed.
This marked the beginning
of your plan.
It's not surprising that they called you
Kuroh the cheater.
No, it's not like that.
I gave up this name three years ago.
I just want a lot of money
so that the government doesn't persecute me.
I would never have thought
that you could be a peaceful citizen.
This is for my own peace.
You killed rich parents.
Hey, hey, her father's death
has nothing to do with me.
It was unexpected.
It doesn't matter, it's none of my business.
Just hurry up and give us a signal.
Our ship has been moored
nearby for almost a week.
My boys are impatient.
Hey, that's bad.
We accidentally heard something very bad.
Hey, what's going on?
It looks like the disassembly is starting here.
What are you talking about?
You're lost. They're real pirates.
They say that Captain Kuroh
is the most cunning and cruel
of all pirates.
I heard that the Sea Watch
caught him and executed him
three years ago.
But Captain Kuroh is alive.
Kuroh Adol lives in Kapikun.
It started a long time ago.
He had been carefully planning
how to inherit Kai's condition for three years.
They're going to attack the village.
And Kai will be in danger.
No!
That's terrible.
Hey, if you stand up, they won't notice you.
Hey, you down there!
Don't you dare hurt the lady!
Who are you?
They're going to see us.
Hide quickly, or they're going to kill us.
Well, well.
It's not a lie, is it?
I was also fooled.
What?
Did you hear anything?
No, no, no.
Did you say something?
We were just passing by. We didn't hear anything.
I heard everything.
I think we have no choice.
Hey, you two!
Look closely at this ring.
What?
It's bad. It's a weapon.
After one or two, Jango, you'll fall asleep.
Got it?
One, two...
Hide quickly, or we're dead.
Jango!
Hey, Jango, wake up!
Haven't you got rid of your old problems yet?
Hey, what's going on?
You're going to fall!
Oh, he fell down.
I didn't mean to kill him.
After falling from such a cliff,
nothing can save him.
Damn it!
That guy!
Damn it!
He killed him!
Damn it!
What about the second one?
I have to finish him off.
There's no need for that.
No matter how much noise he makes,
it's all going to be in vain.
Let's agree on tomorrow morning, Jango.
Let's attack the village at dawn.
Don't pay too much attention to the villagers.
Make sure everything looks like an accident
when you kill Mrs. Kaya.
Tomorrow!
This is a trap, Kun.
No matter what you do,
nothing will get in the way of my plans.
Damn it!
Are you sure it won't get in the way?
Of course.
My plan won't fail.
This is bad!
Very bad!
All the villagers I know and love
will be killed!
I really love them all!
Who are you?
I'm Usopp, the brave warrior of the sea.
Have you been sad lately?
Let me entertain you with stories.
I don't want to listen to your gossip.
Please leave.
Or I'll call the guards.
And then?
What happened next?
Then we bravely entered the battle, of course.
That guy cut out the figure
of that giant cat.
Damn it!
Let's get out of here!
