What's wrong with this restaurant? It looks like... It looks like a pirate ship!
This is terrible! The man from the Kreygasm has escaped!
Isn't this a restaurant?
Do you have enough money, sir?
What about the field?
I don't have any money.
I don't have any money.
What about the shooting range?
As I thought, you don't have any money.
Eat!
Finally, I found my coke!
It's just great!
Why don't you just run away and not become a pirate like them?
We don't need you anymore!
Episode 22
The Great Pirate Fleet, Captain Don Karayik
Hey, old man!
Am I not a chef assistant? What the hell do I need here?
You always fight with our visitors.
And you kill yourself for any beauty that turns out to be in the field of view.
And you cook disgustingly.
You're just an abuser for this restaurant.
That's what I mean.
What?
In any case, the rest of the cooks don't like you.
Why don't you become a pirate? Or who else do you want there?
Why don't you just get the hell out of here?
What the hell?
I'm not a fool, but you hit the head of the old shit.
I don't care about the rest of your crap.
But I'll never forgive you for coming to my cooking.
I don't care what you're going to say.
I'm going to be a chef here.
And if you don't like it, it's your problem.
How dare you beat your boss?
You stupid eggplant!
Damn it!
You're annoying.
No matter how hard you try.
I'm going to be a chef here.
Go to hell by this time.
I'm not going to die.
I'm going to live another 100 years.
What's the name of my old song?
Isn't it great that he gave you his blessing?
Now you can live with us.
No!
Okay.
Please forgive me for what happened.
To smooth out my guilt, I'll order you a cup of Macedonia.
My princess.
Thank you. You're so kind.
No, nothing in particular.
What is it? You're not apologizing to us.
You're a very kind cat.
I brought you tea. Are you happy?
You have to be grateful to me, long-nosed.
Yes. Do you want to fight?
I'm not that easy opponent.
Take him, Zora. You can handle it yourself.
Please don't fight in front of me.
Okay, madam. I won't.
Who is fighting in front of you?
Well, you know...
The food is so delicious, but...
It's a little expensive for me.
Of course, I won't allow you to pay.
Thank you.
You pay.
I don't know what's going on.
Hey, why are you relaxing?
Go and give the visitors a napkin when they come in.
Yes, sir.
God, it's been almost four days.
I'm sick of this place.
What do you think, when will we finally sleep?
I have no idea.
Don't you think he's going to stay here for a year?
Why not?
There's free food and a cozy atmosphere.
It's just for you.
Hey, Luffy!
What's wrong with you?
Let's get out of this restaurant quickly.
Guys, could you wait a little longer?
I'll try to talk to the boss again.
Please.
Hey, Luffy!
Hey, what happened?
I was wrong to go there.
Oh, no.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.
Give me a hug too.
Did you remember this face?
This is the face of the pumped blood of us.
Shut up, Luffy.
Okay.
Hey, Luffy.
Oh my God.
Hey, Luffy!
Why? Why is he here?
Look carefully, Patty!
They're really here!
Can you help us chase them away?
Couldn't you make a mistake?
He's the leader of the 5,000th pirate team!
Why did he make such a way
just to avenge one man?
There are no mistakes here!
He's really here!
He's the leader of the 5,000th pirate team!
Why did he make such a way
just to avenge one man?
He's really here!
We have to get out of here!
What a huge ship!
What a huge ship!
Do you think that Jim came to pay you back?
I doubt it.
But it's strange.
Hey!
What?
It looks like he's got a pretty big ship.
It doesn't look like he was attacked
with ship guns or something like that.
But it doesn't look like
a human hand at all.
Maybe it's a tornado?
He's coming.
He's coming.
What?
Please!
Can you give me some water
or some food?
If you need money,
I have it.
How much do you want?
I can't tell you how long
I've been eating for the last time.
Please!
Give me some water
or something to eat.
Please!
What happened to them?
It doesn't look like
they were attacked with ship guns or something like that.
Is this really the worst pirate
Don Craig?
He looks hungry.
Captain!
Don Craig!
Please!
Please help my captain!
He's going to die of hunger!
He hasn't eaten for many days!
If he doesn't get food now,
he's going to die!
This is great!
So this is the famous
Don Craig.
This time we have money!
Aren't we visitors?
Not in this life!
Hey, call the sea watchman!
What?
He's weakened.
They won't have such a chance anymore.
Don't give him food!
Throw him out of here!
That's right!
If he was in a normal state
and we don't know what he would do,
he would count a lot of bad things.
He's hungry.
He's never done anything good in his life.
He would have attacked us
if he were healthy.
We won't give him a glass of water.
I won't do anything.
I won't do anything.
I promise I will
after I eat.
So, please,
help me!
Don Craig,
please, stop!
Don't beg!
How can you be so humble?
Please, stop!
I promise!
Please!
Anything, even objects!
Anything!
Don!
Don Craig,
please, stop!
It's you!
Don Craig,
please!
I won't do anything.
Take this!
I promise!
Take this!
I won't do anything.
Don Craig,
please, stop!
I promise!
Take this!
Sanji-san!
Thank you!
Hey, Sanji!
Take this food!
Do you know who this man is?
This is King Isblu, a cunning pirate!
It all started in prison.
He pretended to be one of the sea guards.
He killed the captain of that ship,
captured the ship and became a pirate.
Sometimes he raised the flag of the sea guard and entered the port.
And there he attacked the city and the ported ships.
Or pretended to be the creator and then took an unexpected attack.
He did everything to win.
This is how he came to what he is now.
What is he?
He is a smart man, isn't he?
Even now he should not be underestimated.
If he leaves, how can you believe what he says?
We will serve the whole world if we give up this bastard!

Sanji!
Sanji!
Don't you break your promise, Don Kray!
You promised that you would never harm these people,
so I took you here.
Besides, this man saved our lives.
Yes, that was good.
I restored his strength.
What's going on?
What's going on in the restaurant?
Let's go check it out.
Are you serious?
Are you afraid?
No, don't talk nonsense!
Strange.
I don't see anyone on this ship.
Isn't it a great restaurant?
I'll take it.
So, that's why you came.
My ship has been destroyed.
I want a new one.
Leave when you get your things.
What?
Don Kray!
That's not what you promised.
There are about a hundred people still alive on that ship.
They are all head and wounded.
First, prepare food and water for a hundred people.
Some of them are already dying of hunger.
Water!
Right now!
We know that these pirates will attack us later.
We shouldn't help them.
We refuse.
You refuse?
You understand correctly.
I don't order food.
I give you orders.
No one!
Not even me!
Don't blame me!
Sanji-san.
Sanji-san, I'm sorry.
I didn't think it would be like this.
You bastard!
Look what you've done!
Hey, Sanji!
Where are you going?
To the kitchen.
I'm going to prepare food for a hundred people.
Sanji-san!
Sanji!
What?
Yes.
That's how it should be done.
You're a toy for Don Kray, Sanji!
I will never let you get into the kitchen!
Enough of your nonsense!
Please.
If you want to stop me, go ahead.
I understand perfectly.
I know that he is an impenetrable fool.
But that's not my business.
It doesn't concern me.
It doesn't concern me what will happen after they get their food.
Don't worry at all.
I'm a cook.
Nothing more.
When people are hungry, I will bring them food.
That's all.
For a cook.
Isn't that enough?
Patti!
Hey!
Take him away from here!
Sanji!
You gave food to the visitors I brought from here, didn't you?
I don't care who's right and who's wrong.
But I can't let that happen.
I can't let you do whatever you want anymore.
I will protect this restaurant.
Fortunately, there is only one enemy here.
What can Don Kray do to us all alone?
Pirates have been coming to us all the time.
I'm always ready for anything.
Did you enjoy your food, Craig-san?
What about this?
How did you end up eating?
What about some metal for dessert?
Don!
I think I broke the door.
The boss must be mad at me for it.
Yes, everything is fine, we defended this place.
It's a small loss.
What do we do about those people on the Krayga ship?
I don't know.
Why don't we just pour oil on their ship and not fry them there?
That sounds delicious!
Stupid cock!
Give me such a terrible dessert!
This is a pathetic restaurant!
What a shame!
These armor!
Can they shoot?
Do what I say!
I'm the strongest here!
These armor are more powerful than any other!
The superswap of my armor!
Stronger than anything else!
I'm the strongest!
I'm the strongest!
I'm the strongest!
I'm the strongest!
I'm the strongest!
And I have diamond fists that can destroy anything!
The army is 5,000 people!
I have never lost a battle in my life!
I am a perfect personality, demanding the treatment of the Don!
On the way, boy!
I order you to cook me food!
Now hurry up and do it!
No one is allowed to serve me!
I have a hundred people!
Help me deliver it to the ship!
Zef, you're a scoundrel!
What are you doing, old man?
Isn't it a little risky?
Zef...
Zef...
