The Last of Us
The Last of Us
Glory, wealth, power!
The one who has achieved all this in the world is the king of pirates, the Golden Rodja.
His last words before the execution were sent to the sea by people.
My treasures? If you need them, I'll give them to you.
Look for them! I left them all there.
In pursuit of their dreams, people went to the Grand Line.
The great faith of pirates enters the world.

I never thought you'd come across this Melesgo.
It doesn't look like the pirate gang of Kuroneko.
Huh?
Django!
Hey!
You can't say that!
It's not a problem that these annoying kids are here.
I'll tell them.
So what?
I knew they'd come and try to stop you.
But that's what I didn't expect.
Why are you idiots so useless?
We're useless?
Who's useless?
How dare you say that, Captain Kuro?
You used to be strong.
But it was three years ago.
While you were lying around in this village, we didn't lose you for nothing.
That's right!
We robbed a lot of villages and broke a bunch of pirate gangs.
What do you mean?
Can you have enough skill to beat us three years from now?
Stop, you bastards!
You're no longer our captain!
Sorry, but we're going to attack you!
Stop!
How did he get behind them?
And this is a weapon.
Who are you?
Who?
Who do you want to kill?
Get out of here!
He's gone!
Here they are! Invisible steps!
Invisible steps?
You were right.
I'm not as fast as I used to be.
Zoro was with them, but it was hard for him to deal with them.
And he's so easy.
Invisible steps of this man are...
Invisible steps of this man are...
The movement technique.
Even if you have 50 kills, he will destroy them all, and they won't even notice anything.
It's dangerous for his life.
And three years later, I see his old habits, and my hair turns bald.
So that his cat's claws don't scratch his face, he always corrected his glasses this way.
It proves that he will never forget how to fight.
I've become more modest.
I've been on this island for three years.
I'll give you five minutes.
And if you don't kill them in five minutes...
Then I...
I'll kill them all.
Five minutes.
We'll manage somehow.
In five minutes, yes.
It's him!
If we kill him, we'll finally be able to pass this slope.
God, you're the only one who can reflect our attack.
We'll finish in five seconds.
I'm counting on you, brothers.
Zora!
What?
Hey, you! Don't you dare kick my balls!
Where's my thank you?
Yes.
Thank you.
It's useless, it's useless.
Even with three swords, the result will be the same.
Tiger!
Damn it!
On the hunt!
Four minutes left.
Four minutes.
Use three swords and master three-sword technique?
Completely different things.
Impossible!
It's a hit today!
He split up with the N'Yaban brothers.
It's the only hit.
It's a hit.
Don't worry.
In five minutes, no one will be left here.
I'll take care of it.
Three minutes left.
This bastard, I'll kill him.
Captain, please hypnotize me.
Please, captain.
He's still alive.
Looks like you're too soft.
Probably he was saved by his fat.
I'll take care of it.
Kill him, Buchi!
Hypnosis again, huh?
Now he has become more serious.
He breaks the ground into pieces in the usual form.
But what is he capable of becoming so powerful?
Chance!
I need to run and wake him up.
What are you going to do this time?
What a boring woman.
Everyone has already received combat wounds.
While he...
Die!
Get up!
Nami, take care!
Two minutes left.
Get up!
Nami, take care!
I'll cut you in half.
Get down!
What?
The ring!
Isn't this just a hypnosis tool?
Nami, how dare you trample my face?
He's still alive?
Was it an incredible calculation or just a coincidence?
Luffy!
What's going on?
What's going on?
Luffy!
It hurts!
It hurts!
This guy woke up!
I'll sew him up!
I can't do anything in five minutes!
Nami, damn you!
It hurts!
It's not me!
It's not...
Nami, is your shoulder hurt?
It's okay, I'm fine.
Either way, I did what I could.
I'll give you the rest.
We can't lose this battle to them.
Yes!
For the sake of my treasures!
Well, I should have guessed.
Do it!
For the sake of my treasures!
Of course!
It's in your spirit!
One minute left.
It's impossible!
Captain Django Ibuchi-san won't make it in time!
I can't finish it in time!
I can't finish it in time!
Captain Django Ibuchi-san won't make it in time!
I can't finish it in time!
I can't finish it in time!
Ibuchi, there's no time to be a fool.
You take care of that guy with the belt, and I'll take care of that little psycho.
You, Mogivara!
It's almost time to kill everyone.
Huh?
What? This nasty apicoon is here too?
This scoundrel?
Didn't he fall from the cliff and didn't break?
Great!
Don't even think about it!
Get away from me!
Kaya!
Usopsan, are you okay?
Kaya, what are you doing here?
Kaya, what are you doing here?
I'm sorry, Usopsan.
I know, you can never forgive me for what I did.
I just couldn't believe that...
K-Kurakadol Pirate...
Now it doesn't matter!
Why did you come here?
I told you to hide!
He wants to kill you!
But aren't you fighting?
I did a terrible thing to you!
You're covered in wounds and you're still fighting!
That's why, Mrs. Kaya...
Why are you here?
Please, stop!
Please, stop it, Kurakadol!
Mary, you told me everything!
Aren't those people from the mansion?
So, that was the ultimate goal of our plan!
So, we don't have to go to the village anymore?
We just have to finish this girl, right?
Kurakadol, I beg you!
If you need my condition, I'll give it to you!
Then please, get out of here!
Right now!
Thank you for the offer, but...
There's something else I want.
I need...
...soul peace.
Peace?
Yes, all I need is peace.
I've spent three years trying to gain the trust of the locals...
...who have made me feel very comfortable.
That's why I'd like to keep this feeling of peace with me forever.
Therefore...
Therefore, I have to kill Kurakadol!
I have to get this peace and your condition!
That means the pirates will attack this village!
And then...
...you'll stop your existence and die!
These two conditions are absolutely necessary!
No, no, he's...
...not Kurakadol!
Run! Run, because everything you tell him is useless!
Run!
He's not Kurakadol!
He's not Kurakadol!
Kaya!
Get out of this village!
Oh, you're really aiming at me out of a gun.
Get out of here, now!
So that's how it is.
You've grown a lot in the last three years.
Mrs. Kaya...
...do you still remember?
A lot has happened in the last three years.
From the moment you lay down in bed every time...
...and cried over your parents.
It really was a long time ago.
I still remember the sad and happy days we had together.
Kurakadol!
We went shopping together.
I took care of you when you were sick.
You were always so happy to hear my stories.
I gave you everything I had.
I've always...
Yes, always...
...beared it.
Yes, it was all...
...so that I could kill you one day.
Today!
I, the former captain of the Kura...
...was supposed to always smile at the snobby girl.
Despite how much I hated it...
...I worked hard to make you happy.
Bastard!
Can you imagine my humiliation in those days?
Can you imagine me before the famous captain of the Kura...
...who did this?
Hooray!
If you think about it, I...
...didn't sweat it out for hitting you in the face.
Usopp-san!
You hit me pretty hard back then.
Oh!
If you don't like it that way, get it 100 times stronger.
