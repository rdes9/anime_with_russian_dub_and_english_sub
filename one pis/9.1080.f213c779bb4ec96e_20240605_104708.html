Look for them!
I left them all there!
In pursuit of their dreams, people are sent to the Grand Line!
Now the world is entering a great era of pirates!
One Piece!
One Piece!

People!
An alarm!
Pirates are here!
Pirates!

The pirates have come!

Run, people!
Episode 9, Honest Lies, Captain Usopp
We can't go to the Grand Line in such a state.
Oh, really, I would prefer to eat more meat.
And we only have apples.
A little bit of sake wouldn't hurt.
What are you talking about?
I'm not talking about that.
I'm saying that the Grand Line is the most dangerous place in the world.
A lot of pirates are looking for One Piece.
And their ships are clearly more powerful.
Then let's make friends with them.
We don't just need a team.
Our ship is also completely unequipped.
Such a situation does not guarantee us safety.
We also need a choir.
And a musician.
A musician?
Are you out of your mind?
If we keep our course south, there will be a small inhabited island.
It would be nice to get a good boat there.
Yeah, it's time to eat some meat.
Don't forget about sake.
You!
Pirates!
Pirates!
People, save yourselves!
Pirates are here!
Pirates!
On the shore!
Pirates!
Pirates!
Pirates!
I lied!
You're lying!
I'll teach you a lesson today!
Don't move!
You're not lucky today!
Come on, come on, come on!
Stop, you scoundrel!
Catch me if you can!
Come on, catch me!
Fast legs and nothing to be afraid of!
Damn, he ran away again!
This bastard has a solid headache.
Not only did he hit me.
Where could he have gone?
Today I did a good deed again.
The fresh wind brought me back to this boring village.
Yeah, there he is!
Oh, it's you, guys!
Good morning, Captain Usopp!
Pirate Usopp's ball has arrived!
Piman and Ninjin!
There are only two of you today. Where are Monagi?
I don't know.
Piman and Ninjin!
There are only two of you today. Where is Monagi?
This is terrible!
Terrible!
Terrible!
Monagi is there.
What is he talking about?
This is terrible, terrible, terrible!
Pirates!
A boat is approaching our village!
It was a lie!
It's true!
It's true!
It's true!
It's a disaster!
Oh, no!
It's time for me to have a snack!
Don't run away!
Actually, I'm sick.
I'll die if I don't have a snack.
Cheater!
Captain, don't you want to become a real pirate?
How can you become a real pirate if you're afraid of other pirates?
I saw a badge of a buggy clown.
A buggy clown?
A buggy clown?
I'm better.
But there are only two small boats.
I noticed only three people.
Okay, get ready!
The pirate sheik will save the rest of the village.
Brothers, follow me!
Yes!
Let's go!
I haven't been on land for a long time.
Wow!
So the village will continue along this road, right?
Although this is just a small village.
Oh, in this case, and meat, meat, meat, meat!
There must be a lot of food in the village, right?
Can you think of anything else besides food?
What?
Be careful!
Someone is here!
Where? Where? Where? Where?
Be careful!
Wow!
This is terrible!
It's not the time to panic!
I'm Usopp, the head of the great pirate sheik who captured this village.
Everyone praises me and calls me Captain Usopp.
If you thought you could capture this village, better save your strength.
Otherwise, my 80 million guys will crush you like bugs.
Unbelievable!
It's a lie!
She figured it out!
I see. He said I figured it out.
You figured it out! That's bad!
What?
Did he cheat?
Damn it!
Well, 80 million was an exaggeration, but I still have a lot of strong and strong companions!
There are three of them!
She figured it out!
Run!
Hey, guys, don't run away!
I've never heard of pirates using Ippachinko.
And you're pretty interesting!
Hey, you!
Don't laugh at me! I'm a very proud man!
Because of my great pride, everyone calls me Usopp the Pride!
As you heard earlier, I shoot Ippachinko cooler than a gun.
Since you mentioned a gun, put your life on it.
It's not a tool for scaring people.
It's a tool for scaring people.
A real man in front of you! A real pirate!
And the sound is not the adaptation of the project Animedia.TV.
Definitely, brother, definitely!
Then don't make fun of him.
He said that he didn't beat anyone yet.
Let's go!
The fear of people.
As I thought, the words of real pirates sound much scarier.
It's incredible.
This is a quote.
Shanks is a pirate I deeply respect.
You said Shanks?
Do you know the Red Shanks, the Great Pirate?
Yes, I'm Sopda.
It's your father's name.
It's true, my father's name is Yasop.
How did you know that?
Not bad, right?
I'm a pirate.
I'm a pirate.
My father was on the ship of Shanks.
Yes, you look like him.
As soon as I saw you, I immediately thought that you were his son.
Really?
I never thought that my father could be on such a famous ship.
I don't know how things are now, but most likely they are still together.
The art of shooting your father was really elite.
I'm a pirate.
I'm a pirate.
I'm a pirate.
The art of shooting your father was really elite.
Wow, super!
These are volleys.
I can shoot an ant's ear.
Because I have a son by the name of Usopp.
He's the same age as you.
I've heard it all!
What did you say?
I haven't said everything yet!
Listen!
It's true that I'm breaking up with my son,
but I can't help it!
I have one goal in life,
and that is to be a pirate!
Yes!
Usopp!
I've heard the story about you again and again
until my ears started to fall off.
Yasopp is a great pirate!
Exactly as I thought!
I neglect my own life,
enjoying the vast boundless sea!
I'm proud of my father!
I'm proud of my father!
This makes our conversation more reliable.
This makes our conversation more reliable.
Hey, is there anyone in this village
who controls a ship
or bought a big ship?
As you can see, the village is very small.
As you can see, the village is very small.
I'm very sorry,
but there's no way to find out what you're asking for.
There's a big mansion
on the top of the hill.
Hey, do you know whose it is?
I wonder what if we ask them
for some financial support?
You can't go there!
I remembered that I need to do something else.
I remembered that I need to do something else.
I know the owner of this shop pretty well.
So go ahead, order whatever you want.
So go ahead, order whatever you want.
Let's go!
I'm off!
What's wrong with him?
He's in such a hurry.
Do you want to see Usopp again?
Do you want to see Usopp again?
Do you want to see Usopp again?
Do you want to see Usopp again?
Do you want to see Usopp again?
Do you want to see Usopp again?
Everything will be fine.
I just want to talk to him.
You can't.
This guy is the first LZ in the village.
His lies are shocking
to such a weak young lady like you.
But...
Your deceased parents
have ordered me again and again
to protect you under any circumstances.
to protect you under any circumstances.
Now I'm leaving your medicine here.
Now I'm leaving your medicine here.
Please don't forget to take them on time.
Pedant.
I don't mind being a pedant.
I don't mind being a pedant.
But no means no.
Sorry for the intrusion.
I don't mind being a pedant.
Sorry for the intrusion.
Usopp-chan!
Yo, you look weak, as usual.
Yo, you look weak, as usual.
Sorry.
I'd really like to take you for a visit.
I'd really like to take you for a visit.
I don't want a pedant for free.
I don't want a pedant for free.
Well, not a bad person.
Don't worry about it.
After all, I'm a brave warrior of the sea.
I would surely die in such a small room.
And what kind of story did you come to tell me today?
Let's see.
Okay.
I'll tell you about the time when I was five years old
and I caught a goldfish on the southern pole.
A goldfish?
Yes!
The first thing that shocked me
was how wet it was there.
I thought it was the ground.
I dived and landed.
Are you sure you're here?
I saw that the pirates brought him here.
We'll save him.
Well, they're real pirates.
They'll make us sushi.
Stupid.
Only Baba Yaga eats people.
Okay, everyone get ready.
This will be the greatest battle
of the pirate ball Usopp.
Yes!
The pirate ball Usopp has appeared!
What is it?
The captain is not here.
Really?
Hey, pirates, what did you do
to Captain Usopp?
What did you do to him?
There was so much good meat.
Meat?
Don't tell me that the captain...
What?
What did you do?
Your captain, we...
We ate.
Baba Yaga!
Why are you looking at me?
It's all because you're the fools.
It was just a joke.
Wow!
Great!
If the captain is nowhere to be found,
he's probably here now.
Why is he coming here?
He comes to lie.
He shouldn't do that.
There's nothing wrong with it.
It's different, right?
It's different.
What do you mean?
Lady Kaya lives in this mansion
and she's very weak.
A year ago her parents
died of illness.
And she fell into depression.
Despite all her money,
nothing could make her happy.
That's why the captain
makes up the most incredible stories
to make her laugh.
The captain's lies are just
first class.
I'm sure you've never heard
about a pirate captain like me.
What? He's a good guy.
Yes!
I like how he interferes
in other people's affairs.
He gets close to the heart.
And I like how he lies.
And now the lady has calmed down?
Yes, she has calmed down.
Good!
Then let's go to her
and ask her for a ship.
She's having fun.
Getting inside is an impossible task.
There are huge bodyguards
at the gate all the time.
Luffy, where's Luffy?
Let's go in and see.
Are you really going?
He's stretched his arms
all the way to the ground.
What's going on?
I'm sorry for...
the invasion!
And then we threw a huge punch
from the sky.
We scared them and won.
What?
It's a safe landing.
It's not safe at all.
Are you all right?
Yes, everything's fine.
They heard how great I am
and came to enter my pirate ship.
It's not like that.
We...
came to ask you for a loan.
A loan? Me?
We need a big ship.
Hey, you there!
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
Kurokadoon!
You've got it wrong.
You've made a mess here.
Who's that?
Hello, Michael Jackson.
