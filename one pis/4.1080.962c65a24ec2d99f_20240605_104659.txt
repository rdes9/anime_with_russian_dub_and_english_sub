You don't need them, I'll give them to you.
Look for them! I left them all there!
In pursuit of their dreams, people went to the Grand Line.
The great era of pirates is entering the world!

Look at it.
The actual
Now, he won't be
angry on us.
Oh, look here.
Oh, look here.
Oh, look here.
Oh, look here.
Oh, look here.
Oh, look here.
What's happening?
He's drunk.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Goddammit.
Let's go.
Goddammit.
Thief.
Please.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Thief.
Let's go.
Please.
Thief.
Thief.
Let's go.
Oh, it's a woman!
Hey, what's going on?
I can't believe it!
To meet someone in this boundless sea!
I don't know who you are, but water!
Can you give me some water?
I'll give you as much money as you want!
I'll give you as much money as you want!
I'll give you as much money as you want!
I'll give you as much money as you want!
Please save me!
All right, we'll save you!
But first, let's check the value!
Sorry.
I can't open it.
It worked!
If you want, you can leave everything to yourself.
Turn on the shuttle!
Our shuttle!
You tricked us!
There are several dark clouds in the south.
When they are in the low-pressure zone, they will start a storm.
In the ocean, not all small boats should be on check.
Bingo!
Bye!
Thank you for the treasure!
Wait, we won't forget this!
Episode 4.
The past of Luffy. The appearance of the red Shanks.
I'm hungry.
When will we get to the shore?
Who knows?
We are carried by wind and waves.
Will we get there?
I'm sure we'll get there someday.
Isn't it strange that you are going to become a pirate king?
You don't have any navigation skills.
It's not strange.
I'm just drifting around the sea.
And you are also good.
Aren't you a sea hunter after pirates?
I never said I was a pirate hunter.
I went to the sea to find someone.
But then I couldn't find the way back to my village.
I have no choice but to hunt for pirates for the sake of reward.
Oh, so you just got lost.
Don't talk to me like that!
Shanks!
I went through many battles with this hat, and it is very important to me.
Luffy, I can't give you this hat.
Hey, give me something.
Then take me with you on your next trip, Shanks.
I also want to be a pirate.
How can a boy like you become a pirate?
Why not?
Luffy, it's not just a good swimming skill.
Pirates are something big.
I can fight.
I have a blow like a shot.
Really?
What do you want to say?
Luffy is still a small child.
You are about the same as my son.
I'm not a child, I'm a man.
Well, don't be so angry.
Here, drink some juice.
Thank you.
Did you see? Still a child.
I wish you fell through, Shanks.
Don't you dare laugh at me.
What the hell is wrong with you, nasty Shanks?
I'm sorry to interrupt.
Ah, so these are so-called pirates.
They look like idiots.
Welcome.
We are bandits.
But we don't want to hurt you.
We are bandits.
But we don't want to destroy your bar.
We need ten bottles of sake.
Sorry, but the sake is over.
That's strange.
Pirates drink something?
Water?
This is all the sake that's left.
This is bad.
We drank it all.
Sorry.
If you want, you can take this.
I haven't opened it yet.
I'm in search.
My price is 8 million Belli.
One bottle is not enough.
Don't laugh at me.
Well, now the floor is wet.
I'm terribly sorry, Makina-san.
Do you have a mop?
Let me clean it myself.
Looks like you like cleaning.
Now you will love it even more.
There is no point wasting time if you don't have a drop of sake.
Let's go.
Bye, idiots.
Are you all right?
You're not wounded, Captain.
I'm fine.
Just be surprised.
They attacked you.
What a shame.
Why are you laughing?
It's not cool at all.
Why didn't you give them the dachi?
No matter how strong they are,
if you don't give them the dachi,
you're not a man.
You're not a pirate.
I don't understand your feelings,
but they just spilled a little sake.
There's no reason to be angry.
I don't care.
You're filling your stomach, Luffy.
Shut up.
What are you eating?
You're eating a piece of this box?
Yes.
Spit it out now.
Spit it out.
What are you doing, Shanks?
What was that?
What you ate was a gum-gum fruit.
Gum-gum fruit is also called a female fruit.
You ate it and became a rubber man.
And now you will never be able to swim.
It can't be.
You're a fool.
We were going to drink well.
What does that mean, kid?
Damn it, I'm sorry.
You put Shanks and his team at risk.
I said something that you didn't agree with.
Exactly.
I'm sorry.
Mr. Mayor.
Did you see the face of those pirates?
These pirates are nothing but cowards.
Stop it.
Don't mess with Shanks and his team.
They're not cowards.
Stop it, Luffy.
Don't mess with Shanks.
You're stupid bandits.
You're bad at choosing words.
I don't leave those who annoy me alive.
Please stop.
Please let this boy go.
I don't know what Luffy did, but I'm not going to fight with you.
We can't even give you money.
Please let the child go.
Mr. Mayor.
Does the old man know what to say?
It's too late.
This guy pissed me off.
I'm going to kill him.
What kind of shit are you?
What kind of child is that?
Think before you speak.
Luffy!
Please let him go.
I wonder why there's no one in the store.
Maybe they're the bandits.
Captain!
Shanks!
Pirate, are you still here?
You've cleared the whole village.
Luffy!
Didn't you get a good hit?
Shut up!
I don't know why you're here.
You'd better get out of here while you're still alive.
If you come any closer, I'll blow your brains out.
He said not to come any closer.
Or you'll get a hole in your head.
Risk your health.
What?
You risk your life by swinging a gun.
What the hell are you talking about?
These are not children's toys.
You killed him.
What kind of shameless bastard are you?
Shameless? Don't be naive.
You don't fight with saints.
Those who stand in front of you are pirates.
Shut up!
We didn't touch you.
Listen, bandits.
I'll be patient if I get hit in the head.
And I'll just laugh about it.
But if for some reason
you hurt my friends, I won't forgive you.
Shanks!
You won't forgive us?
Nonsense pirates!
Guys, kill them all!
I'm enough to split with all of them.
You underestimate us, bandit.
If you want to fight us,
you have to bring a warship.
Cool!
Wait a minute.
This guy started it all.
Looks like you have a reward for your head.
Damn it!
A smoke bomb!
Luffy!
Damn it! He took Luffy!
What should we do?
It's not the time to panic.
We'll find them if we take them all together.
Damn it!
This guy!
I managed to escape.
They wouldn't even think that a bandit is hiding in the ocean.
Damn it!
Let go of me, stupid dirty gorilla!
Or you'll die!
Fool, you're the one who's going to die.
You really pissed me off.
Bye!
Damn it!
Damn it!
Damn it!
I didn't even move him once.
Damn it!
I'm sorry.
I'm useless now.
What the hell is this?
Somebody help me!
Chance!
Surprise!
Miko I owe you my lifeed, Luffy.
Mikonosan told me everything. You fought with them because of us.
Hey, don't cry. You're a man.
Moa! Shanks!
Your hand!
The price of your life is not too high. It's just a hand.
I'm glad you're not hurt.
Shanks!
Are you leaving?
Yes. We stayed here for a long time, but now it's time to leave.
Are you going to miss us?
Yes, I will miss you. This time I will not ask you to take me with you.
I can do it myself. I will become a pirate.
And I was not going to take you with me.
You can become a pirate yourself.
I can! I will gather my own team, cooler than yours.
And I will find the greatest treasure in the world.
It doesn't matter how, but I will become a pirate king.
Oh, are you going to surpass us?
Then?
I will give you this hat to preserve it.
It is very important to me.
Take good care of it.
Shanks!
Give it back to me someday.
Like a great pirate.
This is Luffy's promise.
Yes.
Hey, if you keep sitting like that, you'll miss her again.
She's very valuable, isn't she?
Thank you, Zoro.
I'm hungry.
A bird?
Let's eat this bird.
How?
Give it to me.
Gomu-Gomu-No!
Rocket!
I see.
Help me!
What are you doing?
Hey, stop, please!
You're on the boat, stop!
The shipwreck victims are not on time.
I won't stop the boat, so hold on.
What?
Did you succeed?
You tried to kill us.
Stop the boat.
We're from the Bagi-Clown gang.
We're taking this shipwreck.
Who would have thought that you would become a famous hunter on the pirate Zoro?
I'm sorry.
Because of you, I lost sight of my friend.
No matter what, go straight.
This Luffy will be able to take care of himself when landing.
Well?
What do we do now?
We can't let Captain Bagi find out that the girl took the boat and the treasure from us.
Who is Bagi?
The one you're talking about?
You don't know anything about Bagi-Clown?
I've never heard of him.
He's the captain of our pirate ship.
He got the power to eat the devil's fruit.
Actually, he's a pretty scary person.
Come on, go.
I did it!
I finally got her!
Wait!
Turn the map, you bastard!
We just stole her!
The Grand Line map!
If we don't return her now, our lives will be in danger!
Captain, I don't want to be killed by the captain's gun!
Captain Buggy, there's something in the sky above us!
Shoot it!
What's that?
What's that?
What's that?
Someone fell from the sky!
Damn it!
