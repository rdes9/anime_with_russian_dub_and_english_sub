        <pre>Find them! I left them all there!
In pursuit of their dreams, people went to the Grand Climb.
The great era of pirates is now entering!
One Piece!
One Piece!
One Piece!
One Piece!
One Piece!
You're just a son of a low-ranking pirate!
You called my father a low-ranking pirate?
I sympathize with you.
You must have been overwhelmed with hatred.
Hatred for your crazy father,
who left you and your mother for the sake of treasure hunting,
as a pirate!
You bastard! Stop insulting my father!
One Piece!
One Piece!
This will be the first step of my plan
on the way to getting a huge state.
Hey, you down there!
Don't you dare insult the lady!
You fool!
Episode 11
Unveiling of a secret plan
Pirate Apikun, Captain Kuro
Captain is seriously delayed.
And Luffy too.
Maybe his experience on the stage was too great.
Every time he's upset, he goes to the sea and looks at the ocean.
Captain!
What's going on?
Shouldn't Luffy be with him?
Captain!
Where's Luffy?
Wasn't he at the party with you?
Don't you think he's still angry
at the fact that we came to his father and all that?
I have no idea.
No!
His expression was different.
Something must have happened.
What could have changed his expression?
Hey, how do we get to this party?
Guys, do you think something could have happened there?
Something must have happened at the party.
Pirate Apikun is in action again.
I got it.
Now just tell me how to get there.
It's awful.
People!
It's a fight!
Pirate Apikun!
It's a fight!
Pirates are coming!
Tomorrow morning pirates will attack this village.
People, save yourselves!
People, what are you doing?
People!
Yusup, maybe that's enough?
I'm sick of it.
This time we're definitely not going to let you go unpunished.
No, it's not what you think.
This time I'm telling the truth.
Shut up!
You're always lying to us.
If you were as truthful as Kurokado,
we would have believed you.
It doesn't matter how much noise he makes,
it's going to be useless.
Let's agree on tomorrow morning, Django.
Let's attack the village at dawn.
Damn it!
He didn't pay any attention to me because he knew
that no one would believe me.
It's going to happen soon, right?
These glasses were specially ordered from another city.
I just came back with them.
Yes, great.
Sorry for making you rush all the way.
Is it a present?
Yes.
Tomorrow will be three years since Kurokado appeared in this house.
And all these years he took care of me.
I'm sure Kurokado-san will be very happy.
Guys, listen to me this time.
The pirates are really attacking the village tomorrow morning.
If we had believed your fairy tales,
we would have had to throw our houses several hundred times.
Please believe me.
You have to be patient.
It's true.
Everyone will be killed.
This time it's pure truth.
This time we'll catch you.
Damn it!
Hey, don't let him get away!
It's here.
The captain always treats his broken heart here.
This is really a nice place.
They are pulling a straw hat and there is no one here.
What a steep slope here.
Nami, be careful there.
Look! There!
What?
It's him!
They are pulling straw hats!
His ass!
Luffy, why are you here?
He fell and died from a blow.
That's why, captain.
Quiet!
There he is.
Quiet!
Good morning!
Usobsan?
I was so worried.
I thought you would never come back here.
Run, Kaya!
The captain is coming!
Run, Kaya!
Run, Kaya!
Run, Kaya!
Run, Kaya!
They are going to kill you!
What happened?
You were deceived!
Your epic was a pirate!
Wait a minute!
What a joke!
It's not a joke!
I heard it with my own ears!
Kaya!
It's a real pirate!
He came into your house for your sake!
He was playing an epic for the last three years to take your properties!
What are you talking about, Usobsan?
I heard him talking to his old friend,
telling him to come and kill you!
He is a cold-blooded killer!
What happened?
Hurry up and run!
I used to be very harmless.
But it's a lie.
It doesn't look like you, Usobsan.
No, it's not a lie.
It's true!
It's true!

Kaya is going to kill you!
They are going to attack the village!
Is it true, Nityan?
Yes, that's what they said.
That's right.
By the way, how did you manage to sleep here?
Oh, well...
I thought I was still at the top of the cliff.
As we thought, Kurokado turned out to be a villain.
It's not surprising that he instilled such fear.
That's why the captain ran to the village as a fugitive.
Aren't you lucky that you heard about it in advance?
Now we can get down to the attack.
They got through.
That's right.
We have to run too.
Yes, but we need to take the necessary equipment.
Otherwise, we have to hurry.
Oh no!
What?
If we don't hurry and get some food, the owner of the shop will leave.
Leave us without meat.
It's not the time to think about it now.
Hey, Usopp-san.
So, what's the story you're not going to tell today?
What's going to happen today?
Okay.
I'll tell you a story that happened when I was five years old.
It's about a battle with a goldfish on the South Pole.
With a goldfish?
Have you ever fought with a goldfish?
Wow, it was so huge that it wouldn't fit into the pool the size of this house.
Really?
First of all, I was shocked by the size of her poop.
First, I decided that it was land, so I swam and landed.
Are you kidding me?
It's hard to believe, but it's true.
True.
Then I had to dry my clothes.
So I lit the fire, but it was a bad idea.
Why?
Because the goldfish swung its tail, which surprised me.
Oh no!
And the choked one jumped to save herself.
A little more and she turned into a fried fish.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I really didn't like it.
I didn't like all the stories you wrote.
Why did you say that?
That's not it.
I said it wasn't for the sake of the goldfish.
Why are you...
Kaya, I...
Why?
Lady, what happened?
Run away, Kaya!
Stop it, Usopp-san!
Let go, or else the cockroach-san will kill you.
Let me go! Leave this village right now!
Until this Pekun comes back!
Don't! Please!
Let's go!
As soon as tomorrow comes, will you believe me?
And now we just run away from here!
Please, listen to me!
Damn it!
Let's go!
Leave this village right now!
No!
Please, catch him!
Don't let him do anything else to the lady!
What the hell is he doing?
Why?
No one believes me.
There! Catch him!
Usobson!
Lady, please calm down!
Comrades, I'm glad you're all here.
Three years have passed.
Before my plan came to an end,
I've already prepared a plan for you.
Tomorrow morning you will destroy this village.
Who are you?
I'm Usobson.
The brave warrior of the sea.
You're very sad lately.
So let me entertain you with stories.
I don't want to listen to your nonsense.
Please leave or I'll call the guards.
Don't worry about it.
I'll take a little of your time.
This is a story about how I saved a whale in the North Sea
when I was three years old.
Whale?
Yeah, it was a huge whale.
It had a sore throat and I licked it inside,
but it confused me with food.
Let's make a deal for tomorrow morning, Django.
Let's attack the village at dawn.
Captain!
Yo, it's you guys.
Captain!
Yo!
Hey, are you still alive?
Alive?
I just woke up.
He was sleeping all this time.
We heard everything, Captain.
We must warn all the pirates.
Warn everyone?
Warn everyone?
What the hell?
Shut up!
You're always lying to us.
If you were as honest as Kurokado,
we'd believe you.
I was just joking, as always.
I was so mad at that monkey
that I started telling everyone that he was a pirate.
Oh, I see.
The captain just lied to Nityan in a straw hat.
Hey, what's going on?
I've started to lose my respect for you, Captain.
And I've started to lose my respect for you, Captain.
And I've started to lose my respect for you, Captain.
Even if that monkey is a bad person,
we never thought that your lies
could hurt someone else.
I think we respected you very much, Captain.
I'm really leaving, Captain.
Me too.
Let's go home.
Yes, it's time to have dinner.
I wonder what we have for dinner.
Ouch!
Ouch!
Well, this should help.
Why did you tell me all this?
Because I'm a liar.
Nobody believes me.
I was too naive.
Even if you're naive, the truth is the truth.
These pirates are going to attack us, aren't they?
Yes, without a doubt they will.
But everyone thinks that it's all a lie.
Everyone thinks that tomorrow is going to be an ordinary day.
But I'm going to stop the pirates on the shore
and leave all this to the liars.
It's my duty as a liar.
Even if they cut my hand.
They drove me out of the village.
It's still my village.
I love this village.
I want to protect everyone.
I would never have thought that you were such a person.
You drove all your friends to meet with the enemy in person.
Great.
Let's not participate in this war and all the pirate treasures will be mine.
Great, we'll go with you.
Are you guys going to fight with me?
Why?
Because they have more people.
If you're afraid, you can change your mind.
I'm afraid?
No matter how many there are, I'll make them all one left.
I'm a brave warrior, Captain Usopp.
Damn it, damn it.
It's not bullshit.
They are the pirate gang of Kurohado.
Of course I'm afraid.
So what?
I don't need any pity.
Go home.
Go home!
We're not laughing.
We're helping you because we admire your bravery.
Would we risk our lives out of pity?
Damn it!
It's you!
THE END
THE END
THE END
THE END
What's going on?
Usopp is throwing oil on the road.
Oil strategy?
It's a strange strategy.
But the pirates won't come.
What?
Did you make a mistake with the north coast?
Let's go ahead!
My treasure will be taken away!
North, north, north, where is it?
Damn it!
Next time on One Piece.
The pirate gang of Kurohado.
I will become the pirate king!
