The Last of Us
Glory, wealth, power!
The one who achieved all this in the world is the king of pirates of the Golden Roads.
His last words before the execution were sent to the sea by people.
My treasures!
If you need them, I'll give them to you.
Look for them!
I left all of them there.
In pursuit of their dreams, people went to the Grand Line.
The great era of pirates is coming to Nimir!
In pursuit of their dreams, people went to the Grand Line.

Tomorrow is going to be a memorable day for them.
I can't let them enter the village!
Go north! Go north!
If anyone dares to touch my treasures, I'll rip them off!
Damn it!
I can't get through this place!
You're in the way!
I can't let you get through this slope,
because I prefer to continue to lie,
as I did before.
This village, as before, will enjoy another peaceful day,
so I won't let you get through!
They're late.
Those bastards.
They must clearly imagine what will happen if my plan fails.
Kill them all!
I'll kill them all!
Episode 13.
A terrible duel.
Brothers Niaban versus Zoro.
Finally, they're here.
You guys are so strong!
Dua!
You're in no hurry!
It's all because of you!
You pushed me into this oil puddle!
Well, it was an accident.
I couldn't do anything.
It's better that at least one of us got through,
than that we would fight over it.
Then why did you get through?
Go north, not go north!
You didn't even tell me where this north is!
What?
Are you completely sure you ran forward?
Well, that turned out to be very funny.
It's all over now.
Captain Kuro is a very impatient man.
Hey, don't tell me you let any of those bastards beat you!
Listen, we don't have time to fool around.
They're strong, so we have to get even stronger.
Now, look at this ring.
With one two django, you'll become strong.
Your wounds heal, and you'll become very, very, very, very strong.
What is he talking about?
Hypnosis!
It makes them believe that they're strong.
It's just stupidity.
You'll become stronger, much stronger!
One, two, django!
It can't be!
It's completely destroyed!
What a power!
They're really hypnotized!
Not just one of them, but all of them!
Go!
Break the neck of anyone who tries to stop you!
You two, get out of the way!
Now it's our turn!
Hey, Luffy!
Luffy!
You're hypnotized too!
What's going on?
GOMO! GOMO!
A machine gun!
Captain Kuro, you've miscalculated a lot.
They're not helpless puppies.
Let's go!
Where is he going?
What is he doing?
Come on, Luffy!
He's breaking the ship!
No!
He wants to set us up!
He wants to set us up!
He wants to set us up!
Come up with something, Captain!
Damn, it's not the time to just watch!
Swanto Django, you'll fall asleep!
One...
Two...
Django!
No!
What?
Is that Topikon Kurokadov?
He broke into the shore?
He looked very scary!
Is Kaya-san all right?
There!
A pirate balloon for the start!
Hey, don't sleep!
It's still very early!
It's not the time to sleep now!
Something terrible is happening!
I still think that the pirates will attack!
Although the captain said that he lied, but I doubt it!
Me too!
And me!
The captain was acting very strange yesterday!
It can't be!
I remember that the captain always climbed through here!
It's useless!
It's done!
Let's find another way to get in!
You!
How dare you laugh at me!
Just because you don't bleed pirate blood?
You're looking at me from above!
Please stop, Zopsan!
Kurokadov!
Kurokadov, are you there?
Kurokadov!
Mary!
Mary!
What's going on?
What happened?
Wake up, Mary!
Don't die in front of me!
Lady!
Thank God, you're all right!
Mary!
Mary!
Who did this?
Kurokadov!
He did it!
Him!
His true nature is a pirate!
What are you talking about?
He's interested in your inheritance!
That's why he got close to you!
It's...
It's just ridiculous!
It's true!
So...
What did you say to Zopsan yesterday?
Yes!
In fact, only he knew the truth!
He risked his life trying to save us!
But none of us believed a word of what he said!
Run away from here, Kaya!
Or they'll kill you!
Anyway, let's get out of here now!
So we tried to protect the bastard!
And this brave young man...
The man who wanted to save the village...
The man who risked his life to warn us!
We got out of the village!
Somebody!
Is anybody here?
Anybody!
Lady!
It's useless!
Everyone is on vacation since yesterday!
It can't be!
Then I...
Now is not the time for panic!
Nothing has happened yet!
We need you to calm down and think about the resolution that created the situation!
If the purpose of Kurohadolla is to acquire all this in this house...
Then just give it to him!
It's not worth your life!
Yes!
The main problem is that now only you can stop Kurohadolla!
You can do it!
Although you are not obliged to!
I understand!
I will not avoid this!
I realize the consequences!
I'll talk to Kurohadolla soon!

What are you doing?
It's hard to hold on!
These iron bars are too slippery!
But we still need to get through!
Don't you worry about Kaya-san?
Someone is coming!
Let's hide!
It's Kaya-san!
Is she okay?
Wait!
It seems that something is bothering her!
Kaya-san lives alone in this house!
Something is happening!
Something happened!
It seems that they are destroyed!
I think so!
Hey!
We should be more concerned about what Luffy is lying under that pillar!
Don't worry about him!
You better take care of your own wounds!
This scoundrel really understood us!
Now all our plans have gone to hell!
I don't know what to do!
I don't know what to do!
I don't know what to do!
What the hell is going on?
If Captain Kure sees this, we're dead!
Hey, Buchi!
Look what's going on!
What's going on?
We still have a treasure map!
Come out, Niyaban brothers!
Two idiots is the power!
Did you call Captain Jango?
We are invisible!
Sham and Buchi!
Together we are Niyaban brothers!
Buchi, Sham!
We have to climb this slope, however...
As you can see, someone is bothering us!
Take care of them!
It's impossible for us!
Really, Buchi?
Yes, he looks very strong!
Besides, our duty is just to watch over the ship!
That's right, we don't have to participate in the battles!
What is this?
Aren't they supposed to be a treasure map?
Sham, just do it!
Me?
Start!
Okay, I'm coming!
He looks completely different!
What the hell?
Is it possible to fight like this?
Hey, you, get ready, because I'll tear you apart with my claws!
So what do you want me to do with this guy?
You! If you don't stop, I'll kill you!
If you can!
What?
This bastard!
You!
You underestimated me!
Good cover!
I played well too, didn't I?
Maybe I'm too small, but it's better to use a serious Sham from the Niaba brothers!
Meow!
Did you lose something?
I have nothing to do with this!
This is...
A cat's trick!
Give me back those swords!
Give them back?
Do you have a sword in your hands?
These will only get in the way!
Now it's much easier for me!
How dare you to steal my valuables!
Bastard!
What?
Did you try to cut something?
After all, I'm a cat!
Come on, Buchi, it's your turn!
The cow is running!
Get ready!
Hold on!
Got it!
Damn, he got away!
Hey, hold him properly, Sham!
I'm sorry, I was scared. I didn't expect him to be so strong.
Are you playing with me?
If he really fell on me, all my bones would have been broken into pieces!
This time he won't leave!
Of course not!
I'm not so good with the same sword technique, but...
Let's go, Buchi!
Got it, Sham!
Cat claws!
Damn!
They were so aggressive on him!
What are you thinking?
If they continue with the same spirit, he won't get away!
I'll cover him!
Come on!
On my Boshi!
I'll cover you!
He's open!
Why are you shooting at your own people?
It's not like that!
He set himself up!
Huh? He set himself up?
Idiot!
Do you want to die?
I don't want to die!
Maybe...
He was protecting us!
If you shot at them, they would have attacked us in return!
It's not the time to worry about us!
Damn!
If I had at least one more sword!
I'll go get his swords!
If Zoro gets them back, he'll be able to win!
So will I!
Don't push yourself!
You can't even stand still!
Hey, Nami!
Nami!
What are you going to do with these swords?
Damn it!
I'll explain everything!
It's been going on for a long time.
Why don't you act according to the plan?
Captain Kuro!
We're all fucked!
Stop!
Psycho!
What the hell is going on here?!
The End
The End
The End
What the hell?
Are they friends?
Those two are being investigated!
I can't read Kuro's mind!
Kaya, watch out!
Why did you come here?
Hey, where's Ruby?
She's still asleep!
Get up!
I'll protect Mikuya!
Next time on One Piece
Ruby's Revival
Kaya Princess's Death
I'll become the King of the Pirates!
The End
