It's not the time, Luffy-san.
He's being held there.
The famous pirate hunter...
...Tororo Nozora!
He's like an animal, thirsty for blood.
He lives only for the sake of reward.
He'll cut his throat for everyone.
He's a human-shaped demon.
Episode 2
The appearance of the great fictivist...
...the pirate hunter Tororo Nozora!
We're here!
In the city where the sea watchmen live!
Hey, Luffy-san.
It's not a very good idea to make him a member of your team.
And I'm not going to if he's not a good person.
And he was arrested for being a bad person.
Mmm, it's good.
I wonder what's inside the base.
It looks like Nozora is under arrest here.
Nevertheless, let's go to the base.
You want to join the sea watchmen, don't you?
Yeah, but I'm not ready yet.
I heard that Captain Morgan is in charge of this base.
It's a very funny city.
It's strange.
I can understand Nozora, but why are they afraid of the captain?
It really bothers me.
Maybe they just like to be afraid.
I don't think so.
Well, here we are.
I'm finally here.
Here we are.
I'm finally here.
I'm finally here.
I'm finally here.
We'll split up here, Luffy-san.
Even though our meeting was so short.
Hey, Luffy-san, what are you doing?
Where is that demon?
He can't be in such a place.
He must be somewhere inside in a separate room.
There he is.
Look, here's the guy.
He can't be here.
A black cloak.
A belt.
It's Nozora.
And if we untie this rope, he can escape, right?
Don't talk nonsense.
What do you think will happen if we let him out?
He'll probably kill you, Luffy-san.
Don't worry, I'm strong.
This guy is in his mind.
Hey, clowns.
I'm tired of you.
Get lost.
Luffy-san, if you recruit a guy like him,
it doesn't matter how much life you have.
It's dangerous. Luffy-san, please stop her.
She'll die.
What?
Do you want to eat?
I made some onigiri.
You'll get killed, clown. Get out of here.
You haven't eaten anything after all.
I cooked it for the first time.
But I did it from the bottom of my heart.
I'm not hungry.
You're unbearable. Go home immediately.
I don't need anything.
Don't make me kick you.
Don't scare the child.
Looks like you still have the energy of Rarararanzora.
And another guy appeared.
Thank God.
It's a sea dazor.
So I'm sure everything will be fine with the girl.
Hey, these onigiri look pretty appetizing.
No.
Bastard.
They have a lot of sugar.
They put salt in the onigiri.
I thought it would be tastier.
Take it.
Take it, take it, take it.
Stop it.
What terrible things.
I tried to make them from the bottom of my heart.
You haven't read this ad yet?
Anyone who helps this criminal will be executed.
Captain of the sea dazor Morgan.
Baby, you know my father.
Father?
So this is the son of Captain Morgan?
Hey, throw this shit out of here.
I told you to throw it out.
You don't follow my orders.
I'll tell my father.
Yes, it will be done.
No.
I'm sorry, baby.
What should I do?
No.
Thank you.
Are you all right, Luffy-san?
Are you hurt?
What a terrible person.
It doesn't hurt anywhere.
Bastard.
Looks like you're pretty stubborn since you're still alive.
Yeah, I'll last a whole month.
All right, keep going.
10 days left.
Only if you live that long.
How can he do such a terrible thing, Luffy-san?
He can't.
You're a bad guy.
Are you still here?
Being so publicly humiliated.
Are you really strong?
It's none of your business.
I'd be free in three days.
I'm different.
I'll survive to show him.
No matter what.
What a stubborn guy.
Wait.
Can you give me this?
Are you really going to eat this?
Now it looks more like a sand ball.
Shut up and give it to me.
I told you.
It was delicious.
Thank you.
Really?
Yeah, he ate it all.
I'm so happy.
Is Takzora really as evil as they say?
No.
Well, he's in prison because of us.
What do you mean?
It's all Helmeppo's fault.
Captain Morgan's son.
Get out of here!
My way to my charming puppy.
Whoever gets on the way will be executed.
No, stop it!
Hey, you!
You have a problem with my darling?
Rika, stop it!
You'll get into trouble.
Dog!
Who is it?
I won't let him go.
Who the hell are you?
You can't be...
a hunter after the pirate Mizora.
What if I am?
Who the hell is a hunter after the pirate Mizora?
Give me a break.
You!
You're annoying me.
And your darling too.
Don't you understand?
If my father finds out about this,
these people will be executed.
What do you think?
Why don't we close the deal?
You'll go to jail instead of them.
Let's say for one month.
If you survive for one month,
I'll let you go.
What do you think?
One month, right?
It's been three weeks.
This helmet will beat and kick Zura
while he's tied up there.
Me!
Me!
So that's what happened.
I'm hungry.
We came here to eat for free.
Hey!
Bring me something to drink!
Who are you talking to?
Hurry up!
By the way,
since I'm tired of waiting,
I decided to execute Zura tomorrow.
Come and see.
Who the hell are you?
Luffy, stop!
Here I am!
You hit me!
I'm Captain Morgan's son!
So what?
I'll tell my father that you'll be executed!
Why can't you do something on your own?
Luffy, calm down!
You shouldn't do anything
dirty to your enemies!
I want this, Kobe!
Zura, join me!
I'm...
Great!
Yes, that's right, Captain Morgan!
But lately,
taxes are being collected less
than required by my greatness.
The problem is
that the income of the city has decreased.
The problem is
that many people admire me.
Isn't that so?
Father!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
Father!
There's a man
I want to kill!
You're still weak, Zura!
I made a promise.
I can't die
in such a place.
You again?
You have too much free time.
I came to cut this rope
and you will become my comrade.
What did you say?
I'm looking for people in my pirate team.
I refuse!
Do you want to make me a scoundrel?
What a bother!
What's wrong with being a pirate?
Pirates are rejections.
Why should I want to become one of them?
What does it matter?
You are known as a cruel hunter for pirates.
I don't answer for what people say.
I never regret anything.
I will survive
and do what I want.
I see.
But I already decided that you will be my comrade.
You can't take care of me.
Are you a scoundrel?
Yes, but this idiot Morganov
took my sword.
Then I'll bring your sword.
What?
You will become my comrade.
You are stupid.
Is he going to attack the base alone?
Dupin, the base is on the other side.
Not there.
Gomu Gomu no!
Rocket!
What the hell is this guy?
Okay!
Enough!
Put him down!
Father!
Why don't you help me?
He hit me!
He hit me in the face,
which you didn't even hit me!
The reason why I never hit you in the face
Do you know why?
Because I'm your son.
That's right.
You!
You!
You don't deserve to be hit!
My son is nothing!
Don't get confused!
There is only one great man here.
That's me!
It seems that an unknown guest
was at the square.
That girl over there,
I took care of her.
You killed her, didn't you?
No, she's just a child.
Hey, you!
Go to the city and finish this.
But she's just a little girl.
Even if it's your order, Captain.
It doesn't matter that she's still a child.
Anyone who disobeys my order
is a traitor.
But I can't!
I didn't want to go that far.
I became a captain thanks to this hand.
Listen,
knowledge is everything in this world.
I'm the best captain of this base.
And that means I'm great.
That's why everything I do is right.
I'm the best captain of this base.
I'm the best captain of this base.
I'm the best captain of this base.
That's what I'm doing right.
Isn't that so?
Yes, that is!
I'll take care of this child later.
Look.
It took many months,
and finally completed.
This is a symbol of his might.
Now lift it!
Lift it at the highest point
to demonstrate my greatness!
I'm not deaf, and there's no one here.
I have to find this stupid
and take Zora's sword.
Vira! Vira!
Hey, you!
Did you hurt him?
There's some noise upstairs.
I'm very sorry.
I would like to ask you something.
I told you that this monument depicts me.
And if you scratch it, it will be a betrayal against me.
Let's take a look.
Gomu-Gomu-No!
Rocket!
Die!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
GOMU-GOMUNO!
Rocket!
Die!
Wow!
I'm leaving!
What is this?
Someone has taken off!
I stopped!
Sorry.
I stopped!
I'm sorry.
Take this bastard! I'll kill him!
Yes! It will be done!
Father is the guy who hit me!
Oh, is that you?
I was looking for you! Let's go with me!
You don't have to return anything!
Helmet! Follow him! Don't let him go!
Captain, there's someone at the square!
What?
More and more traitors appear!
Come on! Come on!
Don't miss him!
What's going on?
There's some kind of a mess here!
Where's the sword?
I'll tell you! I'll tell you! Just stop talking to me on the floor!
Okay, tell me!
He's in my room! We just skipped it!
Why didn't you talk about it before?
Now we have to go back, right?
Don't move! Let go of the helmet yourself!
No!
Shoot me if you want!
Don't you dare!
Go away!
Run, Zoro!
If you do this, they'll kill you!
I can't watch anymore!
I want to be a normal sea watchman!
Stop it!
I can't run away!
10 days left!
Tomorrow you will be executed!
What?
Helmeppo was not going to keep his promise!
That's why Luffy got angry and beat Helmeppo!
He's going to catch him now!
I don't ask you to become a pirate!
But please!
Please help Luffy!
Luffy is the only one who can save you!
And now I'm sure you're the only one who can save him!
I think it's only you, Zoro!
Don't move!
For the betrayal you committed against me, you will both be destroyed right now!
This is the room, right?
Here it is!
There are three swords here!
Hey, which one of them belongs to Zoro?
What? Did you cut yourself?
Kubi!
You're doing business here, you scum!
What? You and that guy in the straw hat decided to start a revolution?
I always fight my own battles!
Unlike you, who needs a whole squad to kill me!
Zoro, don't underestimate me!
Your skill is nothing compared to my strength!
Aim!
I...
I can't die in such a place!
You're weak as usual, Zoro!
Gomu-Gomu-No!
Rocket!
Fire!
You! Luffy-san!
Mugiwara!
It can't be!
It won't work!
I told you I'm strong!
Who the hell are you?
I'm Monkey D. Luffy!
The man who will become the pirate king!
Zoro!
Zoro!
