My personal story is someone else's
I'm going against the tempo
I just have to think about it
I'll gather up all my dreams
And go looking for what I've been looking for
Where is my pocket?
So you wanna be my friend?
We are, we are on the curve
We are
For the sake of the victory over this man
For the sake of the victory over this man
The Three-Headed Dragon!
Don't regret it after your death!
The Three-Headed Dragon!
Episode 25
Holy shit, they didn't get me
They want to fight too!
It's so exciting!
Old man, let's make a deal
If I kick them out of here, I won't have to work here anymore, okay?
That's all I could wish for
If I really allowed you to work here for a whole year
The restaurant would stop its existence
Great!
Become the king of pirates!
Are you serious about that?
Of course
I will definitely become the king of pirates
I met many people who praised them with their own strength
But rarely did anyone do it so confidently
I heard that you were once very strong pirates
You also wanted to become the king of pirates, right?
I forgot about the past
Now I'm the chief chef of this restaurant
That's enough
Guys!
Until we have this ship
We won't have to be afraid of the Grand Line
This is the Grand Line
It's better than hiding under the ship of the Sea Guard
Or giving up by waving a white flag
This ship will make it easier to get to the enemy and attack
It's perfect for manoeuvring tactics
Looking at this ship
No one will even think that it is full of pirates
But Don
Even if we go to the Grand Line
What will happen if we meet someone like that again?
A fly in the eye
No
What are you afraid of?
Nothing
Do you think that a normal person can destroy a ship with one blow?
This is the power of the Devil Fruit
According to legend
There are many people in the Grand Line who have the power of the Devil Fruit
But the people in the Grand Line are very cunning
People like the Mishas
Who probably used a special power to destroy the ship on the part
This guy in a straw hat will not be something special
Having appeared on the Grand Line
But Zef the Red Leg
He's been there for a whole year
I can only assume that Zef used a certain strategy to oppose those monsters
The strategy that he was supposed to describe in his magazine
There may also be information about One Piece
I see, you are genius Don Craig
With this ship and the magazine we can get the One Piece
Now you understand guys
Let's go and capture the ship
Yes
This ship belongs to us
We can't give it to you
What would it cost us?
How do we get through this?
Hurry up
The restaurant will become a battlefield
I thought the restaurant was in the sea
If I survive and get out of here
I will definitely spend the rest of my life in a huge restaurant
I swear that I will spend the rest of my life in a huge restaurant
Go to the control room and open the sink
What? Open the sink?
Are you kidding me?
What? Open the sink?
Are you going to give the enemy a place to fight?
Are you worried?
We can't allow the restaurant to become a battlefield
If we fight inside
This old man will never stop crying
Did you say something, asshole?
Yes
I said that you will never shut up
Go
Yes
They are already here
They are coming here
And I'm coming
Come on, come on
Rocket
Is this guy coming here?
Yes
Come on, come on
What the hell does he know?
Good job, waiter
What? Who is he?
Damn it
There are a lot of people like that on the Grand Clan
Sanji
Look carefully at how he fights
Keep an eye on him until the battle is over
They fed you, and you attacked them
You don't even know what gratitude is
I'll make you answer for that
You chose a fight at sea, where there is nowhere to stand
I know that people who have the power of the devil fruit are afraid of the sea
The boy is young
But I can stretch
Sanji
The sink is opening
What is it?
You?
What is it?
You?
From the sea
From nowhere a platform appeared
Wow, cool
Hey, pirates, why don't you fight with your souls?
Oh, I get it
The restaurant will not be damaged
Because in the future it will be ours
Now I want this ship even stronger
And don't dream that the ship will be destroyed
We are fighting, koki
Forward!
The sea weapon is a baratee
Sabagashira number one
Those who are afraid to die, let them grab their boots and get off
I'm scared
I'm scared
I'm scared
I'm scared
I'm scared
I'm scared
What is it?
Cool!
And I want that too
Press
I'm trying
Fire!
Okay, great
Patti, Karne, finish them
Not bad
Don't look in the other direction, aim right at them
Craig, get this
I'll show you my sea weapon, baratee restaurant
What happened?
We came across something
It doesn't move
I'm Don Craig
The man who will conquer all the seas
I told you, I'll do it
I don't have time to play these games
What is this force?
This thing flies here
It will destroy the restaurant now
Sanji!
Your leg!
Sounding adaptation of the project Animedia.TV
Sounded by Shachiburi
I think this is the 13th or 14th series
I don't remember the last one
Actually...
That's how much I love One Piece
What is this force?
It's coming from that direction
It's coming from that direction
It's coming from that direction
It's coming from that direction
It's coming from that direction
Big kick
He just pushed this strange boat
with a foot
The technique of this blow
That's impressive
Give a kick, Sanji
Not bad
Sanji, bastard
Are you trying to kill your men?
What do you mean, A?
I've cut you like a chicken
You almost lost a powerful weapon
You're unworkable
There's no time for Если
Come on, guys, let's go!
Even with weapons and a cook, there is still a cook.
This is a big difference from us.
Go and cook in some dry kitchen.
Hey, why are you losing so easily?
And you still call yourself fighting cocks?
They are strong, completely different from those we used to fight with.
Do not compare us with those dark pirates.
We are the pirates of Craig, the king of East Blue.
I declare!
Tell everyone that this ship belongs to the pirates of Craig!
And do not forget to think.
You will not step here.
That's right!
We have been cooks for more than 10 years.
And we were in 300 restaurants.
At that time, we were all irritated every time we started a fight.
Then we finally appeared here.
Is there anyone here?
This is the restaurant of the Red Legs.
Is it true that the damn cooks are always invited here?
Yes, it's true.
It doesn't matter if they are bandits or fugitive criminals.
Anyone who comes here hungry, I will feed them.
Are you both ready for this?
Yes!
How can we let our customers suffer such a terrible fate?
Why did you hit me?
It symbolized my determination.
Here we can fight and cook as much as we want.
For us, there is no restaurant better than this one.
It's true. Do you understand, Craig?
Everyday cooking is like fighting.
These people are not the same as before.
It's true.
Let's fight! Let's protect the owner! Let's protect the restaurant!
The restaurant!
What the...
What are you doing here?
What the hell is this?
Iron armor.
Also known as the invincible Iron Shield of the Pirates of Craig.
This is me, Pearl-san.
Pearl!
Patty, Carne, are you okay?
How can they be okay?
They were defeated by my striking blow to Pearl's gift.
Wonderful!
I'll take this nice knife.
Let me go! Let me go!
Let me go!
He really knows what he's doing.
I'm definitely interested in him.
The knife is the soul of the cook.
It's not worthy to touch the cook's knife.
Sanji!
Take it and lie here.
I'll deal with these guys.
We won't be defeated by a bunch of useless cooks!
Who do you think you are to be under the influence of useless cooks?
I'll kill you like a fish!
You're so arrogant that you only beat them with your feet.
Or is that your principle?
The cook's hands are his life.
He can't hurt them in battle.
That's why I'll finish you off with these feet.
Will you finish me off?
Impossible.
In my last 61 battles, I was absolutely invincible.
I've never spilled a single drop of blood in battle.
Not a single drop.
It proves how strong I am.
I'm strong.
I'm the strongest of the strongest.
I'm strong, right?
Is he joking?
It's not funny.
Hey, Mugiwara!
If you stare at me like that, you'll lose your head.
Even a sea gun can't resist me.
No attacks can hurt me.
He scared me.
I almost fell into the sea.
Oh no.
Oh no, blood!
Baral, nothing bad happened.
It's just a little bit of blood from the nose.
It's not an injury in battle.
Baral, don't worry about it.
What happened?
It's dangerous.
He looks strange.
What happened to him?
Stop it, Baral.
Don't go crazy because of the blood from the nose.
What the hell is he doing?
Physical damage.
Physical damage.
Physical damage.
Stop it, damn it.
When Baral feels the threat, he ignites himself.
What did you say?
Fire, Baral!
Baral!
Fire, Baral!
Special honor!
Oh, it's hot.
Baral, don't do that.
Hey, hey, people.
I won't destroy you with these fire shields.
Idiot.
Are you going to burn the ship that we are going to capture?
It's hot, it's hot, it's hot.
It's hot, it's hot.
Shit.
Damn it.
We can't jump into the sea because of this fire.
Oh, no, the restaurant is burning.
He really wants to burn this restaurant.
Burn, burn.
Idiot, you'll burn.
Sanji.
How are you going to burn this restaurant?
How can he act so impudently?
He's a fireball.
He even attacked a fire Baral that even animals are afraid of.
Idiot.
If I was afraid of fire, then how could I call myself a cook?
Shit.
How does he annoy me?
Take this.
Wow.
Iron Baral's armor is broken.
What kind of a cook is he?
It's not good.
Shit, shit, shit.
Burn, burn.
Fire Baral continues to burn.
The restaurant is going to burn.
If the fireballs get into the kitchen, the restaurant will be over.
Master, run.
Master.
Oh, the fireball.
It's all bullshit.
He put out the fire with the wind from the stump.
How can this be?
Does it mean that the Red Legazef has not yet lost his skill?
And the old man is strong.
If so, then I will drown you and your sailor.
If so, then I will drown you and your sailor.
If so, then I will drown you and your sailor.
Before the fire burns down the restaurant.
Sanji, be careful.
Oh no, he's surrounded by fire.
Hot, hot.
This is a waiter.
Gomu, Gomu.
Bazooka.
He hit this hot ball.
Hot, hot, hot ass.
Baral is defeated.
Baral-san.
What did he do?
This guy is an idiot.
Every time.
And in the end I have to do everything myself.
This time you can finish, right?
Yes, shoot him.
Red Legazef.
You just need to kill him and our restaurant.
