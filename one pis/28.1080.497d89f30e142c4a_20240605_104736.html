        <pre>You don't need them, I'll give them to you.
Look for them! I left them all there!
In pursuit of their dreams, people went to the Grand Line.
The great era of pirates enters the world!
One Piece
ayım
Going home
Going home
Going home
Going home
Going home
Who is the real storm?
Find the rhythm!
Just think about it!
Write down your dreams!
We're going to find what we're looking for!
The love of the pocket, and you wanna be my girl!
We are, we are on the girl!
We are!
Throw out this gas mask!
You're not with me anymore!
Die!
I won't let you release the poisonous gas!
Don't rush, boy-molot!
Damn!
Gin!
I've never heard such cowardly words!
I'll destroy him right now!
Hey, you! Don't scare Don Craig!
He's the strongest of the living!
It's impossible to defeat him!
Idiot! Open your eyes!
This man is trying to kill you!
Of course!
To admit your feelings for me...
...means to change your role!
So...
...that's why the consequences are obvious!
Gin!
Why? Why?
You did it, didn't you?
But it's too late!
Die with this coke!
Poisonous gas!
M-H-5!
Oh, there's a translation!
Episode 28. I won't die!
The final confrontation! Luffy vs. Craig!
It's approaching! Dive underwater!
Ma'am, to the restaurant! Quickly!
And I owe it!
Sanji, Gin, it's for you!
Waiter!
And now for me!
Everyone underwater!
What should I do? What should I do?
That's it! Power!
It's saved! Thank God it appeared so unexpectedly!
What kind of man is he?
He uses poisonous gas in battles!
This guy is just a devil!
Yeah, it's inhuman!
I wonder if Sanji is an officer in order?
Who knows?
Look! The gas is dissipating!
Sanji!
Sanji!
Sanji!
Sanji!
Sanji!
Sanji!
Sanji!
Sanji!
Gin!
Gin!
Get your hands...
Get your hands off of me!
Gin! Is this your mask?
Masks!
Did you give away yours?
It's all because you're giving such a great value to food.
You'll have to deal with Gorbatov's grave.
So, this bastard followed the order and threw out his mask?
His loyalty goes too far!
Don't cry!
Gingin...
Gingin, you...
You're following the wrong person!
Do you feel sorry for this little bastard?
Bastard?
Exactly!
He's an idiot who dares to obey my order without thinking about the consequences.
He's useless!
Do you want to kill him before he makes the same mistake again?
It's not a manifestation of my sympathy!
It can't be!
Can you imagine that Don Krayt is going to kill his senior assistant?
For nothing!
It doesn't matter how much!
For nothing in the world!
Gin-san is Don's right hand!
Yes!
To this day, no one has served Don as hard as Gin-san!
Even then!
When we had just run away from the Grand Line,
and the sea-seeing full-bodies were chasing us,
while Strap became a bait for Don.
He refused to do anything and fought for the sake of Don.
Can you imagine that he would really kill him?
It's cruel!
Patti!
Is there any antidote here?
Yes, but they are our enemies!
Who cares? Just bring him here!
Idiot!
For starters, put a mask on him!
There should be a little antidote in it!
Bring him here!
Yes!
It will make it easier for him to breathe!
It's the best thing we can do if we want to save him!
Hurry up, Patti!
Harun!
Harun!
Stop it!
Shut up!
Me too!
It's useless.
He has a maximum of one hour left.
Don't die, Gin!
Don't die for the sake of Don Krayt!
Don't die for the sake of this man!
You have to survive, okay?
I will destroy him!
No, stop!
You can't defeat him!
Calm down!
If you jump right at him, you will fall into his trap!
You will die!
I will not die!
If you want to shoot me, you have a great chance!
Hey, you fool!
You're still trying, even knowing that you will inevitably die!
The sea is a death for you, young boy!
It will wipe out in front of you!
Here are the bombs!
Your grave!
My grave?
Shit! Officer, run!
He's wounded!
He's dead!
Officer!
Oh!
Goma Goma Noah!
You fool!
Come on!
Now he's got a cover!
Come on!
It's low!
Hammer!
What?
Hammer!
What?
Don Craig is defeated!
What kind of guy is this?
He hit right through these stupid spikes!
This can't be!
I've never seen anything like this before!
Don Craig is defeated by some kind of snitch!
Did he really hit Don right through his Kenzan coat?
Can you believe it?
So...
So, this is my grave?
Your grave?
My grave?
You fool!
You fool!
You fool!
You fool!
You fool!
You fool!
You fool!
Damn it!
Don't choose my grave!
Because I wasn't going to die here!
ёл
He's too harsh!
During time there are idiots like him
There are such idiots as him.
People who, once chosen a goal, fight to the death.
Who fight to the death.
Is it dangerous to have such people among your enemies?
This battle will end.
Does he lose or win?
I like such guys.

It was voiced by Shachiburi.
Hey, bandit, hold on!
Breathe in some fresh air, breathe in!
Are you all right?
Do you want some water?
Shit!
Do you want my special dessert?
Idiot!
What do you think about feeding a poisoned person with poison?
My poison?
You have no right to say that!
What did you say?
My food is considered the best in the world!
You can die for it!
Hey, don't die!
What do we do?
Hey, hold on!
Don't die, bandit!
He's dead!
Really dead!
Is he really dead?
Dead?
Really?
Is he really dead?
Shut up!
Oh, he's alive!
Don!
Don!
Craig!
Don!
Craig!
Don Craig!
What?
What's going on?
Idiot!
It was just luck!
Don Craig will never lose to a guy like that!
Don't worry!
Bandit!
You said you weren't going to die!
So what?
If this isn't your grave, then whose is it?
It's yours, isn't it?
No, it's yours!
He got hit again!
What the hell is going on here?
Usually the enemy dies without even touching Don Craig.
Don is considered invincible.
This guy...
What kind of a person is he?
He's not bad.
Yes, he is.
He's amazing!
He beat Don Craig!
It's possible, if this guy is involved.
This guy is worthy of being Don's rival.
Isn't he?
Don should be invincible to this guy.
In this case, it's a legend about Don Craig.
Don't make fun of me!
What the hell?
Now he's finished!
Don Craig's most powerful weapon!
It's a big battle spear!
What is it?
It's exploding!
And now...
How long are you going to run away?
Let's see, young boy.
This spear is completely different from the previous one.
What was it before?
After two or three hits, you won't survive.
If it hits you, you'll die!
What kind of a weapon is this?
What the hell is this thing?
It explodes every time it hits.
What's wrong with my legs?
The fight was too long.
He lost too much blood.
He shouldn't fight anymore.
No matter what you do, nothing will come out.
Soon your strength will be exhausted.
Damn it!
Because the deck is broken into so many pieces, I can't fight like I want to.
What a nuisance.
No matter how much I see it, a big battle spear is always amazing.
Yes, the stronger you hit it, the stronger the explosion.
Only a man like Don can use it.
But how strong is it?
Two shields and a spear must be around Don.
But he can handle it very easily.
That's why Don is called the greatest.
Bring on his sword!
Now it won't work.
Die!
Merchant!
Uh, close.
You are hell to destroy.
Hey, you!
Officer!
Officer, are you all right?
It's not over yet.
You got me.
I won't let you die so easily.
Damn!
This Craig!
He'll get the weapons one after the other.
There's no chance.
Even if he has thousands of weapons.
He can't beat the only rod that this guy has.
Nothing special.
You have to understand who's stronger here.
Life or death?
In the battle of Pirat, the one who can slow down even for a fraction of a second,
the one who thinks about death will be crushed.
What do you want to say to that?
At least...
At least...
This kid...
...won't hesitate.
He won't hesitate.
Does it mean that he has a chance to survive?
Or is his confidence simply explained by the fact that he refuses to die?
His confidence?
I don't think so.
You!
Damn you!
It's amazing to hold on like this!
Like I said, this is your grave!
I'm the strongest among the living!
If the huge Craig's fleet is exhausted,
his thousands of copies and poison are exhausted,
his thousands of copies and poison are exhausted,
the rod of this guy is equal to the power of Simoethanus.
The same rod.
I know someone who looks like him,
someone who would join this rod for his own stupid reasons.
A spear!
What have you done?
I just hit him five times in a row with my fist.
Your technique doesn't work anymore.
Get ready!
The translation of the request was voiced by Shachiburi.
The voice-over of the adaptation of the project Animedia.TV
was voiced by Animariactor.Rus
I don't want to lose
The real
I can't even catch a dream
If the world changes
I don't know anything
Take me away
So that the memories don't fade away
Until the end
Why is he fighting with such a broken body?
Does he want to die?
No, he doesn't even think about dying.
A life-threatening ambition, a dream!
I had such a dream too!
This is the end!
Katsuo! Don't die here!
Next time on One Piece
The Decision of the Sword
A One-Handed Spear
I will become the King of Pirates!
