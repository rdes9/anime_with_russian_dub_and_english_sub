Episode 17
Episode 17
The final battle between Kuro and Luffy!
Are you tired?
I'm tired.
There are too many useless movements in Shakushu.
Don't be so self-confident.
While I was playing with you...
You will have a special treatment.
I will let you feel the taste of horror.
Then I will slowly finish you off.
Shakushi!
Shakushu
First
Let's see how you run from now.
Damn! Let him be!
This is the end of your meticulous three-year plan!
What did you say?
He captured Captain Kuro!
It's time to die, isn't it?
It's time to die!
I don't think so!
Damn you brats!
You're late, boy!
I'm afraid.
That's right! This branch was in my way!
What?
Usopp-san!
Make him a rubber man!
Crush Captain Kuro!
Let go!
You!
Don't encourage me!
Take this, hypnotist!
Usopp-san!
Captain!
Let go!
Gomu-Gomuna!
Fire Star!
My plan...
...will never fail!
What?
No!
Damn it!
Damn it!
Damn it!
All of them!
He killed Captain Kuro!
Even the Sea Watch couldn't handle Kuro!
But he really killed him!
But who is he?
Monkey D. Luffy!
Unlike the pirate who refused his name and fled from the sea,
I would never lose to such a guy!
A real pirate will never refuse his name!
Luffy!
I've never heard of him before!
Remember my name for the rest of your life!
Because I'm not a man who will become a pirate king!
This guy...
He...
Take him away!
And don't ever come back!
Thank you.
Even you are exhausted after such a battle, right?
Tell me...
Why were you so angry then?
I didn't like him.
They were absolutely wrong.
Friendship doesn't assume such a relationship.
What are you talking about?
That's how it always is.
Pirates are not noble at all, as you imagine.
Captain Kuro is a typical example.
I want meat!
Why me?
Can you preserve everything that has happened so far?
Can you preserve everything that has happened so far?
What?
Secretly?
But why?
Yes!
We all risked our lives for the sake of the village!
Captain, everyone should know you from the other side!
You will become the hero of our village!
Exactly!
Sobsan, you have to deal with all the misunderstandings.
What misunderstandings?
They think I'm lying, as usual.
And I don't need to know about what happened.
It's just to cause a problem.
Besides, it won't happen again.
I don't think there will be pirates who want to attack this humble village again.
So let's just pretend that nothing happened.
All this was just a game.
I don't force you!
No, I agree!
If it's better for the village...
Me too!
And I won't hesitate!
Kaya...
Aren't you tired?
No.
It's morning already.
I wonder what happened to Susub-kun.
He was acting strange.
It seems he was upset about something.
Mom!
Mom!
Won't Avronishka and Nityan come today?
Hey, little cheater!
You're still not here?
Maybe I was too harsh yesterday.
I'm sure he will come tomorrow.
You can be sure.
Thank you!
Without you, I couldn't protect our village.
What are you talking about?
If you didn't risk your life for this, I wouldn't hesitate.
Me too!
Me too!
It doesn't matter now!
My treasures are with me!
Thanks to this incident, I finally decided on something.
The adaptation of the project was voiced by Animedia.TV.
It was voiced by Shachiburim.
Captain Usopp!
Captain Usopp! What did you want to talk about with us?
Guys, you've done a great job!
As your captain, I'm proud of it!
It's nothing!
Compared to what you've done, we're embarrassed!
No, you guys are really great!
Even though you were scared, you still defended K.U.
The pirate team Usopp was formed 5 years ago,
when you were all 4 years old.
You were the only ones who could protect the village.
You were the only ones who could protect the village.
5 years ago, when you were all 4 years old,
it was our biggest and most successful battle.
Yes!
Even though it was a bit unexpected,
I think I'll go to the sea alone.
I want to be a real pirate!
I've always wondered if it would be right for me
to live here for the rest of my life.
But after meeting them, I finally decided
that if I'm a man, I should know the insolence of the sea.
That's why I have to leave the village!
There's only one reason!
The pirate flag is luring me!
Captain, you're lying, aren't you?
It's just a new invention, isn't it?
It's like a thunder in the clear sky!
Don't you like this village, Captain?
What about the pirate team Usopp?
I want you to do something for me.
I don't want to tell anyone about this.
Say hello to them.
Never!
I don't want to!
Don't go, Captain!
Captain!
Do you remember this place?
We met here for the first time!
Ready!
Usa's brother?
Who are you?
Why are you talking to me like that?
Because you're so famous!
Yumin?
Yes, very famous!
I see!
So that's how it is!
So I'm becoming known as Captain Usopp!
Everyone calls him Usopp the liar, right?
Okay, from today you will become members of the pirate team Usopp!
You can't refuse!
We've been through a lot together!
Let's attack together!
It's Chameleon!
Catch him!
Super Captain!
Of course!
After all, I'm a brave sea warrior!
I don't want to hear these memories about the past from you!
Yeah, I don't want to hear them either!
Because you don't look like yourself, Captain!
Why did you say it so suddenly?
It's...
It's like...
Captain is a fool!
Fool!
Fool!
What are your aspirations?
I want to work in the tavern!
I want to be a sailor!
And I want to become a writer!
Don't let the flames of your desires burn!
Now you have to work hard on your chosen path!
From today...
...the pirate team Usopp...
...will be dissolved!
It's a mess, worm!
I think it's time to get out of here!
Right!
So, where are you?
Yo, miss!
Are you feeling well enough to go out on the street?
Yes?
Last year, all my illnesses were caused by a deep depression...
...caused by the death of my parents.
Usopp himself put in so much effort to entertain me!
I just can't stay in this situation anymore!
I caused you so many problems!
Thank you very much!
I have prepared a small gift for you all!
I hope you like it!
I'm done!
It's time for us to say goodbye to this house!
Okay!
What?!
Why isn't he getting through?!
Caravella!
Is this really for us?!
Yes! Please, take it!
It's a bit old-fashioned, but I designed it myself!
A ship's hull and a three-match system!
It's all part of the control system!
I named it Going Mary!
Allow me to instruct you how to control it!
First, how to change course and adjust power!
No, no, no!
It'll be enough if you teach me how to control it!
What a beautiful ship!
This nose figure is so cool!
I've prepared everything you need for sailing!
Thank you! It's so kind of you!
You're so attentive, you fool!
Usopp-san!
What is he doing?
It doesn't matter, let's just stop him!
He's going straight to the ship!
Th-thank you!
Oh!
So you're really going to the sea, Usopp-san?
Yes!
We need to leave before he changes his mind!
Don't try to stop me!
I'm not going to!
I knew it would be like that!
It's pretty sad!
Next time when I come back from the village,
I'll tell you stories that are way more exciting than the previous ones!
Yes!
I'll be looking forward to it!
You guys take care of yourselves too!
We'll meet again sometime!
Why?
Huh?
Why?
Are you crazy?
I'll become a pirate like you, and we'll be able to meet again!
What are you talking about?
Hurry up and get up!
We're already on our way!
C-captain!
I'm the captain!
Don't fool around! It's me, captain!
Captain's gone!
Yes!
You know, I'm a lot calmer now that he's with those strong guys!
Yes, you're right!
I've never met anyone as strong as them!
It was inevitable, because he always said he wanted to become a pirate!
If we told the villagers about it in the village,
they wouldn't believe it!
Captain!
Captain!
Captain!
Captain!
Captain!
Captain!
Captain!
Captain!
If we told the villagers about it, they wouldn't believe it!
It was so unexpected!
Everything was so bright and lively when the captain was around!
I have an idea!
What idea?
He had a kind heart, didn't he?
Mary!
What?
It's not easy to lie!
Are you talking about Cura Hadol?
No.
So you really wanted to keep Usopp-san?
Lady!
I've heard a lot about his childhood in the village!
Soon after his father left the village,
his mother died!
Pirates are coming!
Dad's pirate ship has arrived!
Don't shout, Usopp!
Mom, Dad has come to take us!
Don't talk nonsense, Usopp!
It's not like that!
When you get better, he'll take us to the sea!
Your father will never come back!
But I'm sure he will!
Your father will never come back!
But you know, I'm proud that I was your father's wife!
But there are legendary medicines that can cure all diseases!
Don't be silly!
You live in the clouds!
Let it be silly!
I don't like to dream!
Because I'm a pirate's son!
Be as brave as your father!
Pirates are coming!
Maybe it's just loneliness,
but he continued to shout even after his mother died.
He always hoped that one day his father's ship would show up on the horizon.
And take him with him to the sea.
People believe that these clothes were hidden behind his lies.
Pirates!
And he, who lost both of his parents,
could not stay away when you got into the same situation.
Now you have to become stronger to pay for everything he did for you.
Yes!
To our new ship and new comrade!
Cheers!
They said that they fight not to die,
but to live.
His lies were always filled with joy of life.
He supported me for life.
Yes, that's right.
Let's go!
Exactly!
Let's go!
We must preserve the spirit of our captain!
One, two, three!
Pirates are coming!
Pirates are coming!
You know, Mary, I want to become a doctor!
Oh, that's a great goal!
