Find them! I left them all there!
In pursuit of their dreams, people went to the Grand Climb.
The great era of pirates is now entering the world!
One Piece!
One Piece!
One Piece!
One Piece!
One Piece!

Fire!
Fire!
It's you!
Luffy-san!
Mugiwara!
What did I tell you? I'm strong!
You... What kind of devil are you?
I'm Luffy!
The man who will become the Pirate King!
Episode Three!
Morgan hanged Luffy!
Who is this beautiful girl?
What?
Will you become the Pirate King?
Do you even understand what you're saying?
The Pirate King is the Pirate King!
What else does that mean?
I was also surprised!
But Luffy-san is not joking!
That's the kind of person he is!
He will become the Pirate King and find the greatest treasure, One Piece!
Here's your sword!
Which of them? I couldn't ask, so I took all three of them!
All three are mine!
I use the technique of three swords!
So you'll take them, right?
But if we fight together, you'll be in my debt!
Be killed by sea sight or come with me!
Which one do you choose?
You're a devilish treachery!
Great!
It's better to fall into the pirates than to die here!
Super!
Now you will be my comrade!
Yes! Great!
I agree! Now untie me!
Who is this guy?
The bullets don't take him!
Mugiwara is an unusual person!
It seems that he ate one of the devilish fruits!
Devilish fruit?
The treasure of the ocean?
Devilish fruit!
They say that whoever eats it will gain an extraordinary power!
The power of fire breath!
The power to create a tsunami!
There are many rumors about devilish fruits!
Too many to understand which of them is really true!
The answer to this may be somewhere on the Grand Line!
Without a doubt, Mugiwara's power is the power of the devilish fruit!
Well, faster!
I can't untie this knot!
Stop spinning it!
It doesn't matter who he is!
Those who go against me will be destroyed!
And if the guns don't work, chop them into pieces!
The knot is getting tighter!
Hurry up and give me my swords!
Luffy!
Rarinozora!
Wow! Cool!
The same movement as the deceased!
I'm scared!
I'm scared!
I promise to be a pirate.
If I go against the Sea Watch, I'll turn out to be illegal.
However, I must warn you of something.
I will always follow my own ambitions.
To become the greatest fencing player in the world!
And if you do something that will prevent this,
I will personally finish you off with my sword!
The greatest fencing player in the world?
That's great!
I have less than a friend who is a pirate and I can't wait for him!
Well, yes.
It doesn't matter if he's a devilish or a saint.
My name will echo all over the world!
What are you doing there?
Finish them off immediately!
Jump, Zora!
Gomu Gomu Noa!
Knut!
Great! Super!
Who are you?
I ate a rubber fruit.
A rubber fruit?
A rubber man!
So he really ate a Jewish fruit.
Captain, he's not our cup of tea.
We can't handle him.
And now Zora is on his side.
This is the captain's order.
Those who complain better shoot yourself.
A military officer doesn't need such weaklings.
What happened to these watchmen?
Bufi-san!
Destroy these watchmen!
I don't like the status quo.
I don't like the status quo.
I'm the captain of the sea watch.
Captain Morgan.
I'm Luffy.
Nice to meet you.
Die!
What's going on?
You scoundrel!
Die!
I don't want to!
Captain Morgan.
He's losing.
How can you call yourself a sea watchman?
You've broken Kobi's dreams.
Wait!
Mugiwara, look here!
I said wait!
Are you an idiot?
Don't you see I have a hostage here?
Helme-possum.
Don't move if you value his life.
If you try to do something, I'll shoot you.
Luffy-san!
I don't want to be a hindrance to your dream, even if I die.
Yes, I know.
Drop it, you idiot.
Kobi is serious.
Don't move!
I said don't move!
I'll kill him!
From behind!
I'm the captain of the sea watch, stupid Morgan.
Father, hurry up and kill!
Gun!
Great!
Zora!
Zora!
I spit on you, captain.
They've caught Captain Morgan!
I can't believe it!
What kind of guys are they?
If anyone else wants to fight, come out.
Hooray!
Great!
Finally!
Yahoo!
Bonzai!
What's going on?
Their captain won, and they're happy.
It's because Captain Morgan scared everyone.
What's wrong, Zora-san?
Are you hurt?
I'm hungry.
I'm sorry.
Just wait here a little bit.
It's not here either.
It's not here either.
No.
It's not here.
It's not here.
There it is!
The Grand Line map!
I knew it was here.
I've finally found the map.
Captain Buggy.
It's not a map, it's a signature.
He is called the Heartless Buggy.
Sounded by the adaptation of the animemedia.tv project.
Sounded by Shachiburi.
Wow, I'm full!
It took Ren three weeks to get full.
Is that all you could eat?
I don't understand how you could eat more than me.
Because it's delicious, isn't it, Kobe?
I'm sorry, I helped a little too.
It's okay, you helped save our city.
You were just incomparable there.
Yes, I'm super.
I will become even cooler.
I'm going to become the king of pirates.
And I found a comrade.
So, how many people are on board?
I remember you said that you were looking for people in the team.
To become the king of pirates, you've probably already hired a team, haven't you?
Yeah, only you.
What does it mean?
Yeah, there are two of us.
Can't we be pirates when there are only two of us?
It doesn't matter, we're stronger.
Damn, where's our pirate ship?
Over there.
This one?
While it's small, I'll get something bigger for us later.
How?
And I also want a pirate flag.
How cool!
Luffy-san wasn't created to make exact plans.
Did I really recognize this guy as the captain?
It's okay, when we go, we'll find more friends.
Hey, hey, where are you going now?
It's obvious, we're going to the Grand Line.
Just the two of us?
One way or another, we're going to the Grand Line.
Just the two of us?
One way or another, it's impossible.
Impossible, impossible, impossible.
The Grand Line is really so dangerous.
Of course, it's dangerous.
You know that there are two oceans in this world, don't you?
The line of land that divides these two oceans is called the Red Line.
The road goes through the center of the Red Line.
And the path that crosses the Red Line is the Grand Line.
Many years ago, the golden Roger, the king of pirates,
achieved everything in this world.
He said that he left the greatest treasure, the One Piece, on the Grand Line.
And that's why half a thousand pirates flock to the Grand Line.
Mini, this is the battlefield.
It's also known as the pirate cemetery.
I heard this from the visitors.
People who once entered the Grand Line didn't come back.
But somewhere there is the One Piece, so we're going there.
Yes, it looks like we have no other choice.
Zura-san, are you going there too?
What are you fussing about? You're not going anywhere anyway.
Even if I don't go, I'm worried.
I can't do that.
Because Luffy and I are going to the Grand Line.
I can't do that.
Because Luffy and I are friends.
Even though we're only friends.
Right?
Yes, our paths diverge, but we'll always be friends.
When I was little, I never had any friends.
No one stood up for me.
And I never stood up for anyone.
But thanks to you, I can now go to the Grand Line.
I learned how to achieve my goals.
I'll fulfill my childhood dreams.
I'll become a sea watchman.
You'd better think about yourself rather than worry about us.
Even though you're forced, you served under the pirate Arvide.
Don't underestimate the Navy Watch Service.
If they find out everything, they may not accept you.
You mean...
Excuse me.
Is it true that you're pirates?
Yes, I just found a new friend.
We're pirates.
We are very grateful to you for saving us from Morgan's power.
However, knowing that you are now pirates, we have no other choice.
You must leave this city immediately.
We owe you our lives, so we will not report you to the headquarters.
Hey, watchman!
What the hell are you talking about?
You guys were also under Morgan's control.
These guys saved our lives.
Yes, that's right.
Well, let's go.
Thank you for the treat, ma'am.
Guys, are you leaving already?
Yes.
Are you with them?
I... I...
Wait a minute, is he with you?
I don't know anything about him.
Luffy-san, you can't.
There was a fat pirate who looked like a duck.
Luffy-san!
If they find out that I was on a pirate ship,
I will never get into the sea view.
She had a big beak.
It was an ugly old witch.
And he served as a pirate for two years.
Please, stop it.
Please, stop it.
Luffy-san!
Finally, you did it, bastard!
You bastard, bastard, bastard!
Bastard!
Stop it, finally!
I will not allow you to break the order in this city.
Hey, enough!
Stop it!
Without a doubt, he is not with you.
Leave our city immediately.
He did it on purpose.
He did it on purpose.
Luffy-san!
Luffy-san!
Luffy-san!
Luffy-san!
For me.
He deliberately went out to hit me.
Even now, it's all over.
I got help from him.
Nothing has changed.
I'm a fool.
I want to...
I want to enter the sea view.
I will do everything you want.
To become a sea watchman.
Commander, I'm against it.
I still do not trust this boy.
Perhaps he is a pirate spy.
First, we must check his biography.
I really want to be a sea watchman.
We lost a lot of watchmen from the pirates.
The life of a sea watchman is not easy.
So...
Permission to enter is granted.
Yes, sir!
It was really something.
Although they could have cut it.
I'm sure Kobe can not worry.
Well, it was a useful experience.
From this moment on, everyone will hate us.
So in pirate life.
Exactly!
Luffy-san!
Thank you very much!
This sea watchman will never forget you!
I have never heard before that sea watchmen thanked pirates.
We will meet again, Kobe!
Luffy-san!
Goodbye, Onetan!
Everyone!
Give honor!
Bye!
Do you have a good friend?
Yes, sir!
What we are doing is a violation of the code of the sea watchman!
We will not eat for three days in punishment!
Understood?
Yes, sir!
Someday...
Someday we will meet again, Luffy-san!
Like a pirate and a sea watchman!
Someday we will meet again!
So, we're going on the road already being pirates!
It looks like we have a crazy adventure ahead.
I will become a pirate king!
You are constantly saying that you will become a pirate king.
Is there any special reason for this?
No!
No reason!
But...
But?
I swore to one person!
To gather a great team,
to find the greatest treasure of the world
and become a pirate king!
This straw hat knows everything!
I see.
Come on!
Grand Line!
I'm coming!
Come on!
