        <pre>I'll give them to you.
Look for them.
I left them in the flowers.
In pursuit of their dreams,
people set off on the Grand Line.
Now the world has entered
the great era of pirates.
One Piece!
One Piece!
One Piece!
One Piece!
One Piece!
One Piece!
Wow!
Episode 1
I am Luffy,
the man who will become the king of pirates.
Hey, don't worry so much, please.
Such a whirlpool cannot harm this ship.
Miss!
May I invite you to dance?
Like this!
Missed again!
Did you miss the target?
What are you doing here?
Ducks!
It's a heavy thing.
It's a wine barrel.
It must be full.
Let's hide it.
Problems on the right side!
There is a pirate flag on the mast!
Pirate ship!
We are being attacked!
We are being attacked!
We are being attacked!
Captain! Pirates!
What?
Gentlemen, please calm down.
Please keep calm.
Please follow my instructions calmly.
Fire!
Kobe!
Yes, yes!
The one who is the most beautiful,
the most handsome and the most beautiful!
Of course, our captain,
Mr. Arvida!
Well said!
Thank you very much!
Mr. Arvida!
We are wasting time, aren't we?
Indeed!
So, let's get the ship on board!
The pirates are here!
They are here!
Go, go, go, go!
Guys, show the power of Arvida!
Pirate iron club!
What are you doing here?
I'm not used to this.
Eh?
You dare to disobey me?
Please, anything but iron thorns.
Then hurry up!
Hurry up!
Hurry up!
Hurry up!
Hurry up!
Hurry up!
Hurry up!
Hurry up!
Hurry up!
Come on!
Hurry up!
Hurry up!
Hurry up!
We are not here to kill.
We are here to take everything that is precious
and the one who resists will fly to the ocean
and the one who resists will fly to the ocean
and whoever resists will become the sea's mat
and whoever resists will become the sea's mat
Hi!
Looks like there's no one here.
Thank God.
Pretty big barrel.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Who are you?
No, I haven't seen you twice.
No, I haven't seen you twice.
You're an asshole!
Hey, you bastard! Are you hiding here and doing nothing again?
Not at all! I'm not taking this fucking bitch with me!
All right, we'll cover your nose. We have a dry throat.
What? If Arvide finds out herself, she'll kill you!
Everything will be covered if you keep your mouth shut. Right, Kobe?
Yes, that's right!
You're very heavy!
Oh, I can't wait any longer!
Don't be so greedy! I'll open it right away!
Oh fuck!
I have just woken up!
What the hell?
Guys, who are you?
Who the hell are you?
He'll catch a cold if he just sleeps here.
It's your fault!
Bastards!
Stop whining!
You don't know that we are pirates!
I'm very hungry.
Do you have anything to eat?
Listen to what they tell you!
Scoundrel!
You are a scoundrel!
You are a scoundrel!
Scoundrel!
Die!
Why are you throwing at people?
Who are you?
Me?
I'm Monkey D'Luffy.
Nice to meet you.
What?
What happened here?
What's wrong with them?
Run faster!
They'll kill you when they come back with your brother.
Even if I want to eat anyway.
How can you talk so calmly?
There are a lot of pirates on the floor.
Don't go there!
Wait!
You're going the wrong way!
Food!
Food!
Food!
Super!
Food!
Maybe they won't find us here.
What should I start with?
With your box?
Oh, I'm right!
It looks great!
I'm Coby.
Are you Luffy?
I am Luffy.
That's right.
It's great!
How did you do this?
A good idea!
Is it a pirate ship?
No.
It's not a ship.
It just captured Arvido himself.
Hmm...
I don't know.
Is there a ship on this ship?
I think so, but...
My ship got stuck in a water turn.
Huh?
That water turn?
We should have died.
Yeah, he surprised me a lot.
Are you a pirate too?
It was a fateful day.
That day I got into a boat. I was going to go fishing.
I got into a boat.
They took me to a pirate ship.
I've been working here for two years now.
Otherwise they'll kill me.
Are you an idiot?
How can you say that?
You have to run away.
It's impossible.
When I think about it,
my legs are shaking from fear.
Oh, you're a coward.
I'm not like you.
Let's move everything out of here
until the sea view appears.
And who's going to stop and talk to my iron club?
Hurry up, look at these treasures
and you'll sleep on the way to meet the iron club.
It's not good.
I can't stand the blows.
Arvido Sama!
There's a problem.
Why are you so noisy?
You're monsters.
Who's a monster?
It's not that.
There was a strange guy from the boat.
He can be a hunter for the rewards.
What?
Sounding and adaptation of the project
Animidia.TV
Sounded by Shachiburi.
And I've already got to this animation.
Let's go.
I'm going to the sea.
I'm going to the sea.
I'm going to the sea.
I'm going to the sea.
You're right.
You're absolutely right.
If only I had the courage
to drift in the ocean in a boat.
That's what I'd like to do.
Luffy-san, what did you achieve
by drifting in a boat across the ocean?
I'm going to become the king of pirates.
The king of pirates?
Seriously?
So Luffy-san is a pirate?
Yeah.
What about your team?
Not yet.
The king of pirates is the one
who has everything in this world.
Wealth, fame, power.
Everything is concentrated
in one person.
So you're going to search for One Piece?
Agassi?
Pirates in the world are looking for that treasure.
Me too.
Impossible, impossible, impossible.
Absolutely impossible.
Impossible to be the first in this great pirate era.
You can't achieve this.
It's impossible.
Why did you hit me?
Because...
I'm fine.
I'm used to it.
It doesn't matter if it's possible or not.
I'll do it because I want to do it.
I want to become the king of pirates.
Even if I die fighting for it.
Well, now I'm fed up.
Maybe I can find a boat now.
Maybe they'll give me one if I ask.
If they're good people, of course.
I never thought about it.
Can I behave like that?
Don't be afraid of death.
What?
Maybe I'll join the Sea Watch?
Sea Watch?
That's right.
It's my dream to catch bad people.
It was my dream since childhood.
Can I do it?
How do I know?
No, I'll do it.
I'm leaving and I won't work as a slave for Arvido.
No, I'll catch Arvido.
You're in a bad company.
Who are you going to catch?
You're not a pirate hunter, Zora.
Zora?
Zora!
Zora!
Zora!
Zora!
Zora!
Zora!
Zora!
Zora!
Zora!
Zora!
Zora!
Zora!
Zora?
Kobi!
Who is the most beautiful woman in this ocean?
Of course, it's...
Who is Tolstukha?
Tolstukha?
Bastard!
Let's go!
Bastard!
It's not good to attack from behind.
It's not fair to attack everyone at once.
It's a joke.
One, two, three!
One, two, three!
One, two, three!
Who are you?
Who are you?
I'm a rubber man.
I'm a rubber man.
You ate the devil's fruit, didn't you?
Yes, I ate the rubber fruit.
So, what is it?
I heard about it, but I didn't think that it really existed.
You have several tricks here.
Are you a hunter for rewards?
No, I'm a pirate.
Pirate?
Alone?
Now I'm alone, but over time I'll gather my friends,
and we'll have fun together.
Now I'm alone, but over time I'll gather my friends,
and we'll have fun together.
Let's see, I think 10 people at once.
I see, so you're a pirate.
That's what makes us enemies, isn't it?
Why?
You saw the power of this iron tube, didn't you?
Is it strong?
I decided to become the king of pirates.
Even if I die in the fight for it.
Who's first?
The first one will be the nasty ugly old witch.
What did you say?
I'll become a sea watchman.
I'll catch and fight with brothers like you.
Do you even understand what you said?
I know.
I'll do what I want.
I'll go into the sea watchman and catch you.
Little scoundrel.
Don't you regret it.
I'll catch you.
I'll catch you.
Little scoundrel.
Don't you regret it.
I'll catch you.
I'll catch you.
It doesn't hurt.
What?
Because I'm rubber.
Rubber.
Pistol.
The sky is so blue.
That's it.
Hey!
Yes?
Give Kobe back the boat.
He's going into the sea watchman.
Let him go.
Yes, sir.
Luffy-san.
What's going on?
That's the sea watchman.
Are you crazy?
Why aren't you going?
I'm a pirate. I can't be seen.
How can I?
They'll arrest me before I get in.
We're almost there.
We managed to get away somehow.
It was fun.
That's Luffy-san.
If you're aiming for One Piece,
it means that you're travelling around the Grand Line.
Isn't that right?
Yes.
It's also called the Pirate Cemetery.
That's why I need a strong team.
He's a pirate hunter. What kind of guy is he?
Are you talking about Zoro?
I heard he was arrested by the Sea Guard.
What?
So he's weak?
Nothing like that! He's a terrible monster!
Why are you asking?
If he turned out to be a good guy, I think I should invite him to the team.
Are you going to do something stupid again?
He can be a good guy! He was caught because he's a bad guy!
It's impossible! Absolutely impossible!
Why did you hit me?
Because...
