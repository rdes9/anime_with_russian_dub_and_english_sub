You need them, I'll give them to you.
Look for them! I left them all there.
In pursuit of their dreams, people went to the Grand Line.
Now the great era of pirates is entering the world!

I'm going to look for something to eat.
Where is my pocket?
That's what you want to be my friend.
We are, we are on the go.
We are!
Gum gum!
What is it?
In short, come on, not you, not me, one week, please.
Are you laughing at me?
And if you just took out the bug, it would still be edible.
I spent three days and three nights preparing this soup.
I'm a visitor!
Visitors, who pays you money?
I think there is money.
What?
I said, money will fill your stomach.
Episode 21.
Unexpected guest.
Yandosanji and Gino's politeness.
Comrades, comrades, comrades, politeness.
Comrades, comrades, comrades, politeness.
Comrades, comrades, comrades, politeness.
Comrades, comrades, comrades, politeness.
This is love.
Only love makes a restaurant.
Visitors are gods.
Service, service, and again service.
And the main basis of the service is sincere greetings.
Welcome, full bastard.
Please enjoy.
The entrance is closed for the poor.
Your 10,000 Beli, keep the change.
Great!
I feel much better.
Now back to work.
Welcome, full bastard.
Service, service, and again service.
Visitor!
You again, Sanji?
What are you doing with our visitor?
Aren't you the lieutenant of the sea watch?
What are the problems, scoundrel?
Don't talk like that.
You don't have the right to call me a scoundrel.
For a restaurant, visitors are everything.
What do you think,
beating up our precious visitors?
Does he care about visitors or not?
This guy didn't just break our plates.
He also insulted our chef.
That's why it seemed to me
that it was worth getting him in a good manner.
What kind of restaurant is this?
Are you talking to all the visitors like that?
How do you manage to stay in this business?
I'll destroy him.
I'll destroy him from this precious restaurant.
I'll destroy him.
I'll contact my boss immediately.
I think this means
I can't let you out of here alive.
Stop it, Sushi.
Get out of here.
He's the first one to start.
Stop it, Sanji.
What are you imagining?
What now? What happened?
What a surprise.
Boss, what's going on?
Dammit.
Did you see what you did?
You destroyed my ceiling.
It's all your fault, boy.
You broke it yourself, grandpa.
What are you doing, boss?
Leave him and help me stop Sanji.
Hey, Sanji.
You're fighting in my restaurant again, scoundrel.
Shut up, old bitch.
What? Who are you talking to?
You want to destroy my restaurant?
You're a cocky boy.
So are you.
Get the fuck out of here.
What's going on with this restaurant?
Even the owner is out of control.
Look at them.
They're like a pirate ship.
Are you blind?
The visitors are gods.
Only those who can take out your stripper.
Betty, Sanji, if you want to fight,
don't do it in front of the visitors.
Are these people really the main cooks?
Lieutenant.
Lieutenant Fullbody.
We have a problem.
Life is boiling in this restaurant.
The pirate pirate Cheyenne Craig ran away.
What?
He fed us with pig.
We've already lost seven of them.
It's ridiculous.
When we caught him three days ago,
he was exhausted to death.
And we didn't feed him like that.
Because the pirates of the terrible Don Craig,
in general,
is the strongest pirate in East Blue.
I'm very sorry.
Another visitor has appeared.
It's better not to disturb him in my restaurant.
Pirate, huh?
It doesn't matter.
Bring me some food.
This is a restaurant, isn't it?
Welcome, complete bastard.
I don't like to repeat, so cut it out.
Bring me some food.
Is he going to kill this coca?
I'm sorry, sir, but we hope
that you will pay for local food.
Do you have enough money?
Will it be enough?
As I expected, you have no money.
What?
And why the hell did you break my chair?
Wow, that's tough.
If you can't pay,
you can't eat.
Well done, Mr. Cod.
This is not an art pirate.
Throw him out yourself.
Oh, you have a burchik in your stomach.
Dirty pirate.
Don't stink.
Bastard, give me some food.
You are not a visitor, so get out of here.
Damn it.
I've had enough.
I don't want anything from this restaurant.
I don't want to be here again.
Well, gentlemen, please come back to your plates.
Get out of here, please.
Damn it! How dare he! I wouldn't let anyone get away!
Hey, do you want to eat?
Shut up! I just heard that you were hungry.
Do you want to eat?
Shut up! Get out of here!
It's even worse. I don't accept mercy. Take it away!
Don't be so stubborn. Just eat. For me, any hungry person is a visitor.
I... I can't pay for this.
The boundless ocean can be very cruel. It's terrible when you have no food or water.
It's just terrible. I understand hungry people more than anyone else.
I don't care if you die with pride, but if you eat, you'll be able to see tomorrow's dawn.
It's so delicious!
It's so delicious! It's so delicious!
I thought I was going to die. I thought I was a dead man.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
It's so delicious! I thought I was going to die. I thought I was a dead man.
How tasty! I've never had such a tasty food in my whole life.
So you liked it?
That's it! I've found my Allah.
You're a lucky fellow.
I thought he didn't give you anything to eat.
It would have been over for you.
Hey, Kog, don't you want to join us?
You will be the chef on my pirate ship.
Sound adaptation of the anime-media.tv project.
Sounded by Shachiburi.
The pirate ship.
Are you a pirate?
Yes.
Then why did you attack this restaurant?
It was an accident. We were just defending ourselves.
What do you mean?
Anyway, it's better for you not to come here anymore.
Our chief was once the chef on the famous pirate ship.
So this old man was a pirate?
For this old man, this restaurant means more than any treasure.
And all the chefs who came after the restaurant gained fame were previously pirates.
In general, pirates often come here instead of here.
It seems that you don't have to get bored here.
It's not bad. I'm used to it.
Lately, most people have come to see chefs and pirates at the port.
But it scared off all the waiters.
That explains everything.
It's not surprising that he wanted me to work here for a whole year.
Come on, join us.
I refuse.
I have my reasons to stay here.
No! I refuse!
From what?
I refuse your refusal.
You're a good cook, so come to us and be a pirate.
Hey, hey, listen to me.
So what are your reasons?
I'm not going to report to you.
Yes, but you didn't tell me to listen to you.
I meant that you should accept my refusal.
You'd better be careful, or I'll tear you apart like a fish.
You're a bastard with a straw hat.
What did you say?
Don't you dare come to my hat until you get into a fight, you bastard.
I'm sorry to interrupt, but...
What?
I'm part of Craig's pirate team.
My name is Gin.
You're a pirate too, aren't you?
What's your goal?
I'm looking for One Piece.
I'm heading for the Grand Line.
And you're still looking for Coco?
Your team should be pretty small.
Yeah, five of us together.
What the hell do you think I am?
You look like a decent guy, so let me give you a little advice.
You'd better not go to the Grand Line.
You're still too young.
Don't rush.
The Grand Line is only a small part of the vast world ocean.
If you want to be a pirate, there are many other opinions about frightening places.
Hmm, I see.
So, do you know anything about the Grand Line?
No, I don't know anything about it.
Nothing, nothing at all.
That's why it's so scary.
You're really one of Craig's horrible people.
And I didn't think they'd get so many of them.
Craig?
The fried rice is ready for the third table.
Take it away, there's no waitress.
Are you sure it's going to be all right, Ratty?
The guy you got out of the restaurant recently.
Isn't he one of Craig's people?
Well, at least that's what I heard.
Don't forget about his captain Don Craig.
In general, he's the greatest pirate in the world.
That's true.
He has about 50 pirate ships under his control.
He's a monster.
What?
What do you want me to do?
He has about 50 people under his control.
What if this guy tells Don Craig what just happened here?
The next one will look like he's visiting a saloon or a grocery store.
He's going to break down this restaurant.
He's going to break down this restaurant.
Do you think I should have let him eat for free?
That would be dishonest to other visitors.
That would be dishonest to other visitors.
That would be dishonest to other visitors.
How many pirates do you think we've killed so far?
How many pirates do you think we've killed so far?
If you're so afraid, you'd better get out of here.
What did you say?
It's because of your position that all the waitresses left us.
Patty, it's your fault that we have such a shortage of cadres.
They're all cowards.
We don't need them.
Come on, get out of here.
Give him a kick in the ass.
Hey, idiots.
Get back to work.
Get back to work.
See you then.
I'm still going to the Grand Line.
Okay, see you then.
We're strangers, so I don't have the right to stop you.
I just thought it was worth meeting you.
Yes, Sanji-san.
Thank you very much.
You saved my life.
You had the best fried rice.
Can I come again?
Anytime.
Where are you, waiter?
Oh, it's the old man.
So you're here?
Go away, Gin.
I'm sorry.
You'll have problems if you don't feed me.
Whatever.
Now there's no evidence left, right?
Don't fall again, Gin.
Thank you, Sanji-san.
I won't forget this.
Sanji, waiter.
Get back to work.
The third table is ready.
My name is Luffy.
Today I'm your new waiter.
Nice to meet you.
The dessert for the sixth table is ready.
Who's taking care of him?
Isn't it you?
I'm busy.
Yeah, because you don't pay attention.
What did you say? Do you want to fight?
If you're just sitting there, go wash the dishes.
Where's Sanji?
He went to the hall to entertain the visitors.
Again?
I'm angry that he's the chef's assistant.
What can we think about it?
He works here longer than anyone else.
Do you know why he stays?
Although he can't live with the boss.
Because he wants to become a chef himself.
Well, you know.
Hey, waiter.
How many plates have you already broken?
I'm sorry, I forgot to count.
It doesn't look like you apologized for breaking them.
Forget about the plates, let's wash everything here.
Okay, give it to me.
Don't you dare eat it.
This is the main dish.
Well, don't be so upset.
Hot!
Hey, wait.
Get out of the kitchen.
Listen, you're going to serve the visitors.
Go ask them if they want anything.
Can you handle it?
It's hard to deal with this strange job.
I wonder if Kobi felt it too.
Hey, waiter.
It's you.
Hey, I heard you're going to work here for a year.
I can repaint the pirate flag.
What is it?
It's not fair.
It's not fair.
It's our free choice.
Take it.
But I have to agree that the food here is great.
I feel a little sorry for you.
You're going to drink it.
Hey, wait.
Hey, wait.
Hey, wait.
Why did you do that?
You too.
Why are you trying to pull yourself out?
My stomach hurts.
Shut up.
Are these idiots his team?
Oh, the boundless ocean.
Thank you for having this random meeting today.
Oh, my love.
Come on, get down on me.
On me, who can't bear this torture?
It doesn't matter if you're a pirate yourself or a demon.
My heart is ready for everything.
I'm ready.
I'm ready.
I'm ready.
I'm ready.
But it's terrible.
There's a huge obstacle between us.
Obstacle? Is that me?
Sanji.
What the hell?
It's just great.
Why don't you just run away and not become a pirate like them?
You don't need this anymore.
I see.
So this cop saved your life.
And you were able to come back.
Is that so?
Yes, yes, Cap.
But...
I would never have thought that something like this could happen to our ship.
Don't cry.
What now?
Let me show you the way.
Let me show you the way to the best restaurant in Barati.
Translated by Shachiburi
The End
The End
The customer is the god.
That's right.
Hey, the real customer is here.
That's the Creek Pirates.
It's a big pirate group with 5000 forces.
5000?
Are you kidding me?
I came here to attack you.
Next time on One Piece.
The strongest pirate fleet.
Captain Don Creek.
I will become the king of pirates.
The End
