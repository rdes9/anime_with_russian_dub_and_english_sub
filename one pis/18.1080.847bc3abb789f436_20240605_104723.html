        <pre>I'll give them to you.
Look for them!
I left them all there.
In pursuit of their dreams, people went to Grand Climb.
The great era of pirates is entering the world today.
One Piece
Grand Climb
Grand Climb
Grand Climb
Stupid pirates.
You dare to attack Going Mary, knowing that she is controlled by the great Captain Sob?
The great battle begins!
Hey, could you pay more attention to people?
Done!
Ready?
Look, this is our pirate flag!
After Sob joined us, there are already four of us.
Now we need our own sign.
And this is our flag?
What do you say? Isn't it great?
Pirate flag is a symbol of death and horror.
I feel the horror, but this is the horror of your talent.
You should have turned to me.
How could you forget about such a brilliant artist?
Brilliant artist?
I have a 50-year experience of drawing on the wall.
When it comes to drawing, no one is better than me.
Wow! 50 years!
That means you're an old man.
Maybe he already has five or six grandchildren.
That's even more amazing!
Hey!
Now look at this skill!
Ta-da!
Who asked you to create your own flag?
Well, I think it should be something like this.
Oh, not bad.
Cool, I like it.
So, from now on, this is our sign.
Okay!
Sob, draw the same thing on the sail!
Okay, done!
Now the pirate ship Going Merry is finally finished!
Episode 18. You're an extraordinary beast!
Gaiman and his amazing friends!
I'm out of here!
Are we going the right way?
It doesn't look good.
What?
Wait!
That's it!
That's it!
It's him!
That's him for sure!
Do you see something?
Something interesting.
Is this the legendary Treasure Island?
Legendary Treasure Island?
I've heard about it.
Yes, it's famous among pirate islands.
And this is an old legend, a strange legend.
Anyone who comes closer to this island faces God's wrath.
Is the legend really true? Is it more anger?
In any case, it sounds funny.
Hey, Luffy, just don't say it.
So that's what you came up with.
Forward to the island of Sakravich!
Oh, your division!
The island is really strange, isn't it?
They say that somewhere on this island there are incredible treasures.
Before, many pirates came here.
But before they found the treasure, they ran away in fear.
Ran away in fear, huh?
For example, some pirates unexpectedly turned into boars in the middle of the night.
Aude's ears began to grow longer and longer, and at the end, like a snake, he was strangled.
You came up with the truth.
I'm just telling the most ridiculous stories.
Don't scare me like that!
I'm hungry.
I'm going to sleep.
How can you sleep in such a strange place?
Really, what nerves do you need to have?
What the hell, don't scare me!
Well, I just decided to dance a little to discharge the atmosphere.
Stop it, Luffy!
Stop it, Luffy!
It's...
Get out of here!
Who's there?
Get out of here!
Where does this voice come from?
I'm the guard god of this island.
If you want to save your life, don't leave this island.
Guard god?
You're pirates, aren't you?
That's right.
As I knew.
Why is the god asking such questions?
Listen, if you take one more step into this stupid forest,
you will be struck by the God's punishment.
Do you really want this?
I wonder why you're asking me about this?
And what the hell is this?
This guy is weird.
What did you say, like in a straw hat?
What the hell is this?
You and the people who came for the treasure
look the same after I turned them into you.
Are you really a god?
There are a lot of strange animals here.
Is that a lion?
No, it's a pig.
What's wrong with you?
I'm a rubber man.
I ate rubber.
I ate rubber fruit.
Devil fruit?
That's impossible.
When I was a pirate, there were rumors.
When you were a pirate?
No, I don't remember the past.
I don't want to hear about the past.
What are you talking about?
You're talking to yourself.
Hey, you, you're really a god.
Shut up!
If you don't go, you will be struck by the God's punishment.
You did it, god.
Why are you still on your feet?
Here you are.
Don't move.
I said, don't move.
That's impossible.
Hey, god.
The gun is useless against him.
But I don't like such surprises.
It's a monster.
Over there.
It's a gun.
Where did he go?
What's that?
It's a bot.
It's moving.
Help me.
It's a human.
It's interesting.
Why does it look like a god?
It tried to attack us.
Shut up.
Help me get up.
Don't be so angry.
I forgive you for today.
Wait.
Hello.
Luffy.
Luffy.
Luffy.
Luffy.
Luffy.
Luffy.
Luffy.
Luffy.
Luffy.
Luffy.
Luffy.
Luffy.
Luffy.
Luffy.
Luffy.
Luffy.
Hey, Luffy.
Luffy.
Luffy.
Help.
Come this way.
So this is going to be good.
So you're a popular god.
Ricca you used this gun...
I can't even get out of this box!
I've been living in this box for 20 years!
In complete solitude!
20 years?
So you've been on this island for 20 years?
Look how my hair and beard grew!
Even my eyebrows grew!
The last time I talked to people was 20 years ago!
Do you understand what I mean?
Why, you fool?
What do you mean, you moron?
What's going on?
Have you been sleeping all this time?
What's going on with him?
I noticed!
This man lives in a box!
Are you a treasure?
Yeah, since I was little, because I was so precious.
That's nonsense!
You don't have to be so stupid and sharp-tongued!
Zora, help me out!
What are you doing?
Stop it, my neck hurts!
You can't get out of here!
Don't be so dishonest!
After so many years spent inside,
my body grew into this box!
If you break it, it'll kill me!
What kind of a box is that?
Who are you?
You're different from the pirates who came here earlier!
I'm Luffy, the pirate king!
What?
I'm going to become the pirate king and get One Piece!
One Piece?
You're not going to go to the Grand Line, are you?
We even have a Grand Line map!
Don't underestimate this place!
It's a hellish tomb!
I've seen pirates running away from the Grand Line!
They were like dead people!
Either something terrible happened to them,
or they met terrible monsters!
None of them could say anything!
And besides, there are so many rumors about One Piece
that no one knows the truth anymore!
The great era of pirates has been going on for 20 years!
One Piece is no longer just a legend, but a great dream!
Where's the Grand Line?
Who knows?
Don't you know, Uncle Kust?
I don't understand the map at all!
Me neither!
Is this how pirates talk to each other?
Anyway, if we get to the Grand Line,
we'll capture as much as possible
and run away as fast as possible!
I'm sure we'll find One Piece!
I'm very lucky!
How can you be so sure?
I'll definitely find him and prove it to you!
I'm not going to argue!
You look like...
You look like a twin to me!
And what's the similarity?
I knew it!
One day our dreams should come true!
We've always wanted to do this!
We?
Searching for treasures doesn't matter in your life!
This old age has changed my life!
Wait, what are you talking about?
It was 20 years ago!
Together with my friends, I came to this island!
We came here to search for treasures!
We've been searching for 200 people for a month!
And it's all in vain!
The only thing we found was an empty box!
Let's go, guys!
Yeah!
What's going on, Gaiman?
I'm going forward, catch up!
Okay!
Upstairs!
No one was looking there, right?
Although the captain was searching on the island for a whole month!
I'll check what's there in the end!
I couldn't believe my eyes!
I found them!
At the top!
Hey, guys!
That's how I ended up inside this box!
When I came to the shore, my friends were already gone!
They left me here!
Wait!
That means that the treasure is now only mine!
I can't get in there in such a state!
I can't get out!
Hey, come back!
All these years, that's the only view of the treasure that doesn't come out of my head!
That's why when pirates came here to search for treasures,
I scared them off with these creatures!
That's how I've been guarding the treasure for 20 years!
They're mine!
There's no doubt about that, they're yours!
Gaiman-san, I understand!
I'll help you get the treasure!
Really?
Yes!
Could it be?
You're a pirate thief, aren't you?
You're rude!
Even I have emotional interruptions!
Is this the place?
I haven't been here in a long time!
Finally, the time has come!
Today is a good day!
I'm counting on you, Mugiwara!
Great!
Gomu-Gomu!
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
Great!
Gomu-Gomu!
Rocket!
Wow!
Do you see them?
What's he doing?
Luffy!
Hey, Luffy!
Hey!
I've got them!
5 chests with treasures!
You've got them!
Finally, I've got the treasure!
Treasure!
Could you bring them here?
My treasures!
Quick, quick!
What?
I said no!
I don't want to give them to you!
What nonsense are you talking about?
Exactly!
These treasures belong to Gaiman-san!
Give them back!
Stop it!
It's okay!
It's okay!
It's not okay!
Irina!
You've been guarding these treasures for 20 years!
Mugiwara!
You're a great guy!
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
I thought about it before!
Maybe!
Even if these thoughts are unbearable!
There's nothing there, right?
Yes!
They're all empty!
It can't be!
The treasures you've been guarding for 20 years
are just empty boxes!
It happens so often with treasures!
Sometimes you can fool yourself
in the pursuit of treasures!
Searching for treasures
is a tough challenge for pirates!
It takes time
to eat your own life
and gives nothing in return!
That's the fate of many pirates!
Don't be so sad, uncle!
You've lived here for 20 years!
And if no one had come here
for another 30 years,
you would have died here!
Mugiwara!
Luffy!
You've gone too far!
All you have to do is get to One Piece
and be a pirate with us again!
Are you inviting me?
I'm still in this state!
No one wanted to talk to me!
I don't even know how much time
has passed since I trusted someone!
Thank you!
Uncle, are you really going to stay
on this island?
Yes, Mugiwara.
Even if there are no treasures here,
there is something else I need to protect.
Huh? Protect what?
In sorrow and in joy,
I've been with them for 20 years!
I can't just leave them!
Now that I know that there are no treasures,
I feel free for the first time!
From now on, I will live in my own pleasure!
I actually started to enjoy
life in a box!
I see! It's a pity, of course,
because you're so funny!
I'm not your real friends, right?
I think Uncle is the strangest here!
What did you say?
Bye! Take care!
Good luck!
Mugiwara,
do your best towards your dream!
I'm sure you'll reach it!
The legendary One Piece treasure!
And then you'll be able to buy
the whole world!
Thank you for watching!
See you next time!
Thank you for watching!
Bye!
One Piece
One Piece
