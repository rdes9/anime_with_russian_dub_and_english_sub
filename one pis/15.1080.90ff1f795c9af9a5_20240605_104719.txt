It's not a theory
It's a personal story
It's about someone
It's about the rhythm
You just have to think about it
You just have to make a dream come true
You just have to find what you're looking for
The love of your pocket
So you wanna be my friend
We are, we are on the curve
We are
The pirate gang Kurenneko is not used to this
We're useless
Zora!
Thank you!
Let's go!
Nami, how dare you!
Urakadol, please stop it!
Run, Kaya!
I gave you everything I had
I always...
Yes
It was all for me to be able to kill you one day
Today!
Asshole!
If you don't like this, you'll get 100 times stronger
Episode 15
Kuro is defeated
Soppo is in need of help and help from Nami
What the hell was that?
How did he do that?
His arm just extended
How did he do that?
He really broke Captain Kuro
Episode 16
Kuro is defeated
Soppo is in need of help and help from Nami
I'm counting on you
I have to get my treasures
There's a pirate gang Usoppo is in need of help
You!
Stop it!
Get up!
Finish him!
You dared to break the peace of our village!
Enough!
What are these scumbags doing?
Damn it, what are they thinking about?
Stop it!
Guys, enough!
Okay, I think that's enough of him
Now they've completely broken Captain Kuro's heart
These stupid scumbags!
Captain!
What were we thinking?
Are you fighting them?
Why didn't you tell us the truth?
Aren't we in the same team?
Aren't we strangers?
Whatever!
In any case, we have to get out of here immediately
Run!
No!
We'll fight together with you
If we see you, it will bring shame to Pirate Gang Usoppo
Scumbags, get out of here!
Captain!
Not bad
You knocked me down with a pretty good blow
You!
Do you have the power of the devil's fruit?
Well, yes, rubber fruit
I'm a rubber man
That really happens
And it's amazing that he's so strange
That's how he is, he's a rubber man
His stretching arms didn't make up
Django!
I'll take care of this guy
And you take care of Mrs. Kai
She'll write down what was planned
And then we'll kill her
And then we'll kill her
And then we'll kill her
And then we'll kill her
And then we'll kill her
And then we'll kill her
Got it
Stop it
I won't let you pass
Bucci!
What?
How did you get there?
What are you doing?
He's not as strong as he used to be.
Damn it!
Kaya!
Damn it!
I have no more strength!
Damn it!
Damn it!
Damn it!
Damn it!
Damn it!
Damn it!
Damn it!
The pirate sheik is gone!
Yes!
Listen to me!
We're not running away!
He's gone too far!
We'll take revenge!
Kaya, help me!
Listen carefully!
I'm entrusting the most important mission to you!
Take Kaya away from here!
And don't tell me you can't!
Because we created a pirate team for the sake of protecting what's expensive!
Usopp-san!
Is this the captain's order?
Yes!
Captain!
Kaya-san, hurry up!
Come here!
What a graceful speech!
In fact, it's the same order to run away!
Go to the forest!
It looks like an exit to the yard!
Django!
Oh, damn it!
I got distracted!
You're so stupid!
You'll never run away from me!
You bastard!
Hurry up and catch them, you idiot!
Okay!
Useless!
I know very well how bad Kaya's condition is!
She won't be able to run away from Django!
You could wish to follow them!
If you can pass this slope!
Muchi!
You've already lost to me once!
Didn't I tell you not to bother me anymore?
Next!
You bastard!
You bastard!
THE END
What was that?
Who knows?
Maybe you should have looked at it yourself?
However...
Maybe you're already late.
You bastard!
You lived under the roof for three years!
Don't you feel any respect for her?
You bastard!
You bastard!
You bastard!
You bastard!
Do you feel sorry for her?
No!
As I told her, Kaya is just a part of my plan.
I could thank her after her death.
You hopeless bastard!
I wasn't going to save him in the beginning.
Usopp!
Go and find them!
And give us everything else!
Leave it to us!
Oh, so you can still move.
Not bad.
Shut up!
I won't let you do what you want!
You dared to betray the locals and Kaya's feelings!
Do you think you can do everything for your own pleasure?
You bastard!
You bastard!
Do you think you can do everything for your own pleasure?
Usopp!
Damn it!
I can't be a single member.
You really made fun of me.
I betrayed them?
Are you kidding me?
It was all planned out.
It's not the kind of games you play for the pirates, Captain.
So, lie down and don't move.
It's good even if you manage to catch up with Django.
You can't handle him.
It's safer for you here.
Even if I can't.
Even if I can't, I want to protect them.
I still want to protect them.
Because I'm the captain of the pirate team, Usopp.
I'm brave and brave.
I won't let you even touch a single person.
What's wrong with him?
Why is he screaming?
Look, he's crying.
What's so funny?
Luffy!
I'm taking Usopp and going for the hypnotist.
Do you have any objections?
No! Go!
I'm sorry.
I'd move faster if I were alone.
But I can't find them without your help in the forest.
Hey, you!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Hey, you!
Who allowed you to leave?
I think it was me.
Go, Zora, Usopp!
And one more hit!
Gomu Gomu No!
Shoot!
Damn, he disappeared again.
Okay, they're gone.
Before we start fighting, I want to ask you one thing.
You're a stranger. Why did you interfere?
Because there's a man here that I don't want to see dead.
It's simple.
But is it normal?
After all, this will be the cause of your death.
It's normal, but I'm not going to die.
Let me ask you a question.
Gomu Gomu No!
Knut!
Pistol!
I'm starting to get bored.
Bastard!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Damn!
Damn!
He tore my mouth.
Mugiwara is really strong, but...
It's Captain Kuro.
Kill him!
Captain Banzai, Captain Kuro!
Super Captain Kuro!
Don't call me by this name.
Haven't you understood yet?
Regarding this, my plan has been completely freed from this name, Captain Kuro.
I'm satisfied.
For days, when I planned everything for you, those who only knew how to arrange a riot,
satisfied with these government steps that continued to chase me for the sake of reward,
I can't take it anymore.
Sea Watch.
This is the third time in a week.
We can't do anything.
We continue those tricks that make us criminals in the search.
We have a rather bad reputation.
That's true.
This name of mine attracts them to us.
That's why I don't want to be Captain Kuro anymore.
You say strange things.
It's impossible.
Sea Watch will chase you to the very death.
Then I will die.
It won't look like I left the pirates.
But you are the captain of this ship.
Then you will be the captain.
This restless life will be enough for me.
I will kill myself in this world.
Captain Kuro! Captain! Captain!
How many ships do they have?
Only one.
What should we do, Captain?
Attack them with our cannons?
Give me a sledgehammer.
Huh?
Sledgehammer!
A sledgehammer!
The senior assistant of Django, Captain Kuro.
Yes, I know.
But how can he go there alone?
He's not going to give up.
What?
They stopped the attack.
What happened?
It's strange.
We're coming.
But...
Just do what I tell you.
Yes!
Hey, get the cannons ready.
I see. That's how it should be.
Hey, you!
Yes, what's going on?
I'm sorry to say goodbye to you so quickly.
Good luck!
All clear!
Dead.
They're all dead!
And now...
...the plan begins.
Hey, listen here.
I saved your life on purpose.
Shut up.
I'm not going to ask you for anything.
Just kill me.
You have character.
You managed to get out so much with a broken jaw.
Not so bad.
I'll give you a little farewell gift.
You're going to die.
You're going to die.
You're going to die.
You're Captain Kuro.
You're Captain Kuro.
You did all this.
One, two...
Django!
My name is Captain Kuro.
I killed all these people.
And you are the man who captured Captain Kuro.
Return to the base and execute this man.
One, two...
Django!
I am the man who captured Captain Kuro!
He's going to blow up again.
That's good.
And as soon as my double dies, Captain Kuro will no longer exist in this world.
So today the plan will be fulfilled.
I will achieve my goal.
I will have money and a peaceful life.
Got it, boy?
This plan, which took three years, cannot fail.
My plans never failed.
Looks like you can do more than just stretch.
Of course, I'm prepared.
Be a pirate!
You said you couldn't take it any longer.
If you're so afraid of being weak in the ocean, then you don't deserve to be a pirate.
If you want to compare ambitions...
We are much more global!
