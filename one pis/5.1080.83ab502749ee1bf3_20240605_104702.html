        <pre>You don't need them, I'll give them to you!
Look for them!
I left them all there!
In pursuit of their dreams, people went to the Grand Line!
The great era of pirates enters the world!
One Piece!
One Piece!
One Piece!
One Piece!
One Piece!
One Piece!
One Piece!
Stop, you bastard!
Give it back!
I'm telling you, give it back!
What are you doing?
Someone fell from the sky!
I'm saved!
What an adventure!
Episode 5
Horrible camp village
Pirate Clown Captain Buggy
I'm hungry!
Boss, you came to save me!
Who are you?
Sorry, I'll leave the rest to you!
Hey, she's running away!
Everything is fine, and her boss stayed here!
I see, he's defending his team!
Tell me, can I get some food here?
Don't play dumb!
Don't touch my treasure!
Bastard!
I wonder if they'll beat him!
Homo Gomuno!
Pistol!
Unbelievable!
You're strong, aren't you?
You defeated Sabli with bare hands!
Ah, it was you, right?
Who are you?
I'm a thief who robbed pirates!
My name is Nami!
Hey, why don't you join me?
No!
I don't have to join you!
Wait!
I said wait!
Now I remember!
I want to eat!
Let me treat you!
Really?
Y-yes!
You haven't caught this thief yet!
I-I just got back, but there are no pirates 3, 6 and 2 yet, Captain Buggy!
Yes!
How the hell did you manage to steal the map so easily?
We were just going to enter the Grand Line
to demonstrate our strength!
Well, Captain, the question of the place where the key was kept was missed!
What did you say?
Well, it wasn't discussed!
Who dared to miss my nose?
Do you want me to put on a mask to cover this nose?
Then you can just miss it!
You misunderstood me!
It's red and very big!
Save me!
It's started!
The power of the devil's fruit!
Who am I?
Who am I?
Captain Buggy!
What happens to people who don't listen to me?
They are expected to die!
Please forgive me!
I will never say that again!
Please forgive me!
This time I forgive you!
Go and get the map immediately!
Otherwise, do you understand?
Yes, Captain Buggy!
Oh, Virginia!
Do you live here?
I don't live in this city!
The locals were scared of Buggy and ran away!
So you're a robber!
It's rude!
I'm a thief who robbed pirates!
Don't confuse me with the robbers!
But thieves are thieves, right?
It doesn't matter how, but I have to get 100 million from Belle!
And what do you have so much money for?
Secret!
If you have a Grandland map, you can get it!
If you have a Grandland map, 100 million from Belle is not an empty dream!
Map?
Are you a navigator?
I understand navigation better than many other navigators!
I see!
That's great!
Why don't you become our navigator?
Really?
Yes!
Pirate team!
No!
Are you a pirate?
Yes!
I promised the man who gave me this hat to become a great pirate!
I hate pirates the most in the world!
I love money and tangerines!
Come on, become our navigator!
I said no!
Okay!
Hey, you found her!
She's not here!
Where did you go, comrade?
If we don't return the map, we won't get to know each other!
These guys!
I have to do something!
Okay!
If you accept my conditions, I'll think about it!
Really!
I'll do anything!
I want you to go with me and look at the gods!
However!
Why did you tie me up?
It's just a rope!
What's the problem?
I don't think anything!
I'm not worried about meeting other pirates!
Let's go!
Hey, wait for me!
What did you say?
The thief managed to hide!
We are very sorry, captain!
There were three of you!
How could she run away?
Then die!
Captain Buggy!
What?
That thief is back!
What did you say?
It's her!
Is this the one who stole the map?
Yes!
I caught the thief, Captain Buggy!
I'm returning the map!
Thank you for returning the map!
But what made you change your mind?
I had a fight with my boss!
I can't stay with him anymore!
Allow me to join your gang!
Captain Buggy is getting angry!
The power of the devil fruit is showing itself again!
Devil fruit?
Sim is overflowing!
What an interesting girl!
My plan was successful!
I knew that pirates are so simple!
Why am I in a cage?
I'm in a good mood today!
What's your name, lady?
Nami!
Great!
Let's have a party in Nami's honor!
Let's have some fun!
What's going on?
This is your party!
You should eat more!
Of course, thank you very much!
I would only take a good time
to take the map again!
Together with Buggy's treasures,
I will take them all!
I want to eat too!
Damn!
I'm so lucky!
Guys!
Prepare Buggy Bombo!
Everything is ready!
What's going on?
Look carefully at Buggy Bombo's power!
Light it up!
What's going on?
What's that explosion?
It's Buggy Bombo!
It's Buggy-sama!
Buggy Bombo?
Buggy Bombo!
Buggy Bombo and the power of the girl's fruit!
I'll rule the Grand Line!
Right, Nami?
Yes, of course!
I'm the one who's going to rule the Grand Line!
I'm going to become the pirate king!
You're an idiot!
Now I understand why you can't work with him.
Exactly!
He's such a terrible simpleton.
That's why I can't follow him anymore.
Really!
In such a case, how can Bagi make you a gift?
Blow up your former boss!
Huh?
It will also be a test of your loyalty to me.
Get ready!
I feel so good!
Since it's a party, let's have more fun!
Do it!
This is my way to have fun!
Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!
Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!
Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire!
If I don't shoot, I will be killed.
But if I shoot, I will be the same as these pirates.
Sounding and adaptation of the animemedia.tv project.
The end.
The sound of a shachibori.
Come on, set it on fire!
Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!
Damn, I'm tired of this.
Nami, don't spoil the party!
What's wrong? Your hands are shaking.
That's what happens if you're morally unprepared.
What do you need to be mentally prepared for?
Kill people? Is that the way of the pirates?
No!
Be ready to risk your life.
Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!
Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!
Hey, bitch, don't make us wait!
That's how you have to set it on fire!
Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!
Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!
Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!
Shoot! Shoot!
Damn, I'm tired of this.
Nami, what does that mean?
I'm sorry.
What? Why are you apologizing now?
What are you doing? Didn't you just save me?
That's funny.
I'm too excited and I broke down.
I won't go down to the level of these pirates.
Oh, I'm too excited.
I will never be like this pirate who took the life of the most important person for me.
Oh, that's why.
Oh, it's on fire!
Do you really think you can resist me, bitch?
Water! Water! Water!
It's a mess.
You!
Behind you!
You're done for!
Hey, hey!
Such a crowd for just one girl?
Zora!
Are you hurt?
Huh? Are you hurt?
Huh?
No, I'm fine.
Thank God!
You really found this place!
Get me out of here quickly!
What are you doing?
You were carried away by a bird and now you're sitting in a cage?
Well, it was pretty funny.
Zora!
He called him that, right?
The comrade he was talking about?
A pirate hunter Zora?
What's going on?
So you're Zora?
What do you want?
Did you come for my head?
No, I'm not interested.
I'm not a pirate hunter anymore.
But I'm interested.
If I kill you, I'll become even more famous.
Don't do that, if your life is expensive.
Well, okay.
It seems he doesn't understand a word.
Smash him, captain!
Captain Buggy!
Buggy! Buggy! Buggy! Buggy!
Buggy! Buggy! Buggy! Buggy!
Get ready to die!
Don't resist!
Wow!
This guy is really weak!
No!
What are they doing?
What's going on?
Zora!
Zora!
Zora!
Zora!
What's going on?
The captain killed them, and they're laughing.
You!
What's so funny?
Zora!
What's wrong with your hand?
What the hell?
Barabara fruit.
What's the name of the fruit I ate?
It's impossible to kill me with a sword!
I'm a dividing person!
His body is coming back!
I thought the devil fruit was just a myth!
Dividing person?
Is he a monster?
A rubber man.
It's early, but it's not dangerous.
But it's still pretty serious.
Buggy! The captain won!
Buggy! Buggy! Buggy!
This is bad.
The situation is getting worse.
If we stay here, we won't live long.
The situation doesn't look very attractive.
Buggy! Buggy! Buggy!
Buggy! Buggy!
Who is this coward?
Big red nose!
Fool!
What did you say?
Who is this?
Big red nose!
Luffy!
Bagi!
I'm going to kick your ass!
You're going to kick my ass? You're dreaming!
You three are going to die today!
How am I going to finish you off?
Useless! This is the end!
I'm not going to die!
Run, Zora!
What?
He's commanding to run away from the man who came to save him!
What's wrong with you?
Got it!
Shit! I don't understand this!
That's why I don't like pirates!
You're not going to run away!
You fool! Your three-barreled style is useless against me!
Hey! Listen to me when I tell you!
What? Are we all going to die?
The cannon is aiming at us!
Hey, wait a minute!
Quickly!
Yes!
Wait, wait, wait!
The Bagi Bomb is still inside!
Did you set it on fire?
Hey, stop! Stop!
Stop! Stop!
To be continued...
To be continued...
To be continued...
What a poor dog!
It's not you!
Oh, there's a white bear on top of a lion!
I've been chasing you guys!
