I'll give you my praise!
Look for them!
I left them all there!
In pursuit of their dreams, people went to the Grand Line!
The great crew of the pirates is now entering!

Jango?
I'll take care of that lad and leave you with Lady Kia.
She'll hime what's going on
and then we'll kill her.
What?!
A pirate balloon!
It's stuck!
Protect the horse!
Luffy!
I'll take the wasp and follow the hypnotist.
Is there a problem?
No, go ahead!
What?!
It's Captain Kuro! Captain Kuro Banzai!
It's Captain Kuro!
Don't call me by that name!
My plan is to get rid of this name, Captain Kuro.
I'm happy with it.
During the days when I planned everything for you,
you, who only knew how to set up Gwald,
were happy with these government shawls
that kept chasing me for the sake of reward.
What?
You say you can't take it anymore?
If you're so afraid of the weak ocean, then you're not a pirate!
If you want to compare ambitions,
my ambitions are much more global.
Episode 16.
Protect Kayo.
Usopp, the Great Pirate.
This hypnotist is still chasing us!
No!
I don't see him.
We really got away from him.
It's impossible to catch us in this forest.
Don't worry, Kayo-san.
We'll protect you.
That's right.
We swear on the name of Usopp, the Great Pirate.
Thank you.
Episode 6.
Protect Kayo.
Not here!
Where are you little pranaers?
Don't be so clever that you can escape from me.
In that case, maybe I should just cut out the whole forest?
Looks like he's very angry.
He's not just a hypnotist.
Where did they go?
This way!
Where did they go?
Where did you go, little bums?
Hey, to the west!
I said to the west, don't you hear me?
Do you think I care about that?
Just tell me, to the right or to the left?
Then turn left!
Turn?
Kaesan!
I'm sorry, guys.
You have to run forward and escape without me.
What are you talking about?
Our mission is to save you, Kaesan!
Oh no, she's got a fever!
Hang in there, Kaesan!
We need a doctor, a doctor!
It's not the time for a doctor right now!
They might kill us!
But we can't run anymore!
Still!
Where are you, Milusga?
Thank you.
I'm happy that you're protecting me.
I'll keep it in my heart.
And now you have to run.
Where are you running to?
It's useless to hide now!
Come out!
If we leave Kaesan and run,
we'll probably be able to hide.
You're right.
The captain always said,
if you're sure you're going to lose,
run as fast as you can.
Damn kids! Where are they?
The captain is such a liar!
It's hard for him to fight.
He neglects his own life
and tries to save us.
We can't let Kaesan die.
If that's the case, we have to do our best.
Pirate Sheik Usoba!
Great! We'll fight till the end.
No, don't!
You're just kids.
You shouldn't die for me.
We don't leave to die.
We fight to live.
That's what the captain always said.
Yes!
Pirates!
It's that bastard!
The cat's claws of Captain Kuro!
There's only five left, right?
Those steel claws of yours!
It's all right. He can still fight.
Right. He still has another hand.
Cut him down, Captain Kuro!
Hey, isn't that a forbidden name?
It seems he's known here as Kuroha.
Something like that.
Let's just call him Kurasan.
Kurasan, kill him!
You fools!
Shut up!
I'll kill you all later.
Of course, I'll kill Jango too.
Why do you want to kill us?
Don't joke like that, Captain Kuro.
If we attack the village now,
it shouldn't be too late yet.
Besides, as soon as Captain Jango
makes this girl write a will,
the plan will be completed.
You don't have to worry about the plan anymore.
As long as your bodies are here,
I can prove my innocence.
I never planned that you would leave this village.
It would be too dangerous.
I don't need anyone to know
that I'm still alive and well.
It can't be!
He was planning to kill us earlier.
That's right.
I was planning it
when I was Captain Kuro three years ago.
That's it.
Everything was planned.
Are you all fools?
Are you a stupid pirate team?
Are you stupid?
Pirate team is just a dog fight
that doesn't suit the life in a TV society.
Without proper planning,
what can they do?
They always followed my plan.
Team members are just instruments
in the hands of the captain.
Their lives and deaths don't matter to me.
No matter what obstacles there are,
my plan must be fulfilled.
They are quite acceptable victims
of my plan.
This is the fate of pirates!
Don't you dare teach me, boy!
Even if a captain like you
had tens of thousands of subordinates,
you would never beat Usopp.
What did you say?
I'm not equal to this imaginary captain?
That's right.
Funny.
Don't be too sure
just because you managed
with one hand of mine.
In what place is he superior, Prince?
Tell me!
Self-control.
What?
You don't know the truth.
What is it like to be a pirate?
This boy!
He really can't keep up
with the speed of invisible steps?
You dared to touch me?
If you really want to know
what real pirates look like,
let me show you this power.
I'll show you.
I'll show you.
I'll show you.
I'll show you.
I'll show you.
How terrible it is
What a terrible thing
to be taken by the pirates so many times!
Hey! Hey!
Is it really Pozo?
Is he going to use this?
He's got only one opponent.
But it is without a doubt
Tua! This is Shakushi!
He's trying to use the shakushis!
We shouldn't just stand here!
We're also under attack!
He's going to kill us too!
Didn't he say that before?
Please, stop, Captain Kuro!
Don't do this! We'll do whatever you want!
Please, Captain Kuro!
What's going on?
He's just swinging back and forth.
Captain Kuro!
Captain!
Please, stop!
Captain Kuro!
Captain Kuro!
Captain Kuro!
Captain!
Captain!
Please, stop!
Captain!
Please, stop!
Captain Kuro!
Shakushin!
I thought he had more blood.
Now we can go back.
What?
No one's moving?
Is it all over?
He's here!
How did he turn out to be killed?
The next one!
And now the rock!
Please stop the tankura!
It's useless!
It's a blind attack, using his invisible steps.
He moves so fast that he can't even tell who he's going to kill.
He used to destroy a huge number of tanks, too.
But now he can't even tell who he's going to kill.
He used to destroy a huge number of tanks, too.
But now he can't even tell who he's going to kill.
What's going on?
Why are the corpses falling like that?
Let's get out of here!
Come on, show yourself, Apikon!
Shoot!
What are you doing?
Why are you destroying your people?
Luffy?
Come on!
You got me!
You bastard!
You'd better stay calm until I finish them all!
Look!
Because of you, all my dear comrades are half-dead.
It would be nicer to finish them off.
What now?
I think you want to say something.
Yes.
I will never become...
...like you.
Not because you don't want to.
You won't be able to.
Not with that kind of talent.
Moreover...
...you will die right now.
You will rot in the dust of suffering, torn to pieces, and then die.
I will give you special attention.
I will not hesitate to deal with you.
Don't do that!
Come out, little scoundrels!
I know you're hiding somewhere here.
Enough already!
We give up!
You can take Kaya-san.
Come here and we will give her to you.
I won't fall for that.
I never believe what such little scoundrels say.
He bought it!
Now!
Get the pepper attack!
I don't know, it was a trap.
Here you go!
Ouch!
Die, hypnotist!
Don't be rude.
Damn, we failed!
You didn't take me seriously.
After all, I'm a pirate.
You guys are playing as pirates.
Where are you hiding, lady?
I'll kill these three first.
You can think about how stupid it was to connect with real pirates.
Where are you?
No!
Run, Kaya-san!
Run!
Hey!
Yes, it's their voices.
Come here!
Please, stop it.
Don't hurt them.
I will write a will.
No, you shouldn't.
As soon as you write, he will beat you.
I'm sorry.
You fools, don't bargain with me.
Captain Kuro wanted me to kill them all.
It can't be.
If you don't satisfy my demands, I won't wait until you kill me.
If you don't satisfy my demands, I won't wait until you kill me.
Then there will be no will.
No, no, no, wait, wait.
Don't do that.
If you don't write this will, I'm a dead man.
Kaya-san!
Okay, I'll let these kids go.
However, I doubt that they will be able to run away.
Here you are.
Don't forget the signature.
I know.
Damn it!
I'll leave all my condition to my godson, Kurohado.
Okay, it's done.
It saved me from trouble with your hypnotization.
You promised not to kill them, didn't you?
Don't worry.
I'm a man of my word, despite my appearance.
Kaya-san!
I found it!
I found it!
I'm wounded, you fool!
There!
There!
Okay, I'm going.
You're done, you hypnotized freak!
Damn it! He found us!
It looks like I have to finish this as soon as possible.
The End
The End
The End
I'm done! I'll leave the rest to you!
I won't lose to you, who gave up your name and ran away from the sea!
Remember my name for the rest of your life!
What's wrong with you?
I hate them!
You're wrong!
Pirates are like that.
Friends are not like that!
Next time on One Piece
Light Explosion
Kuro vs. Ruby
The End
I will become the king of pirates!
The End
