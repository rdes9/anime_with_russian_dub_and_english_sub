They're going to attack, right?
Without a doubt, they're going to attack.
But everyone thinks it's a prank.
I love this village. I want to protect everyone.
Okay, we're coming with you.
This is the pirate ball of Porchodola.
Of course, I'm afraid.
What's going on?
We won't laugh.
If it were true, we would risk our lives.
Episode 12
Battle!
Pirate ball of Kuroneko.
Battle on the slope.
Episode 12
Listen, they're going to attack the village
from the side of this hill tomorrow morning.
Because this is the only way
to get to the village.
In other places, there are breaks.
In other words,
there is no other way to attack.
In other words, if we take this slope,
they won't come to the village.
I see, it sounds simple.
It's easy to say, but for the battle
we need real strength.
What talents do you have?
Dividing, stretching, stealing.
Are you going to fight?
I'm just kidding.
I was just supporting you guys.
Welcome back, Kurohado Usanko.
Where is the lady?
She's already asleep.
She looked so exhausted.
However, I never thought
that something like this could happen
in my absence.
This boy is really stupid.
Yes, he even said
that you are a pirate.
What a ridiculous idea.
Of course.
What is this?
Ah, this is a gift
from the lady.
Three long years have passed
since you became a part of this house.
This is an anniversary gift.
Anniversary?
It seems that your glasses
are constantly slipping.
So these glasses were made
especially for you by order of the lady.
She is so caring and attentive.
Speaking of anniversaries,
tomorrow will definitely be a memorable day.
Isn't the moon
going to be damaged tonight?
Huh?
Such nights
make my heart beat
and my blood boil in excitement.
Kurohado Usanko,
what are you doing
with the lady's gift?
I accepted the gift.
But it's not only
this little thing.
It's the whole condition.
What are you saying?
There is no need
to play this role anymore.
In a few hours
an accident will happen.
These three years
were too long.
Lady, run!
Oops!
The lady died.
Kurohado Usanko,
what are you doing
with the lady's gift?
I accepted the gift.
But it's not only this little thing.
In a few hours
an accident will happen.
In a few hours
an accident will happen.
In a few hours
an accident will happen.
In a few hours
an accident will happen.
In a few hours
an accident will happen.
In a few hours
an accident will happen.
In a few hours
an accident will happen.
In a few hours
an accident will happen.
In a few hours
an accident will happen.
In a few hours
an accident will happen.
In a few hours
an accident will happen.
A few hours later
Captain Django!
The sun is already setting!
Wake up!
Captain Django!
Good morning, Captain!
Good morning!
Idiots!
Good morning!
According to my book
Looks like he's in a bad mood.
Maybe it's because he just woke up.
Look, the moon is still high in the sky, so it's still midnight.
Remember, this is a fortress.
Were you wrong? Apologize!
Until you get used to it.
Good morning, everyone.
You don't mind saying good morning?
It just means that the captain is in a good mood now, and that's it.
I see.
Don't turn your head when you're talking to people.
Friends!
It's time to act!
Okay, great!
Now they won't be able to get up the slope.
The oil puddle will do its job.
When they don't slip on the oil, we'll jump out and destroy them all.
Oil, huh?
In any case, all we need to do is protect this climb.
But we have to be careful not to slip ourselves.
Otherwise, it will be like getting into the sand.
You've made this trap pretty quick.
Of course, I've made it.
It's not important.
I'm completely confident in myself with this trap.
And we have the skill of shooting from a slingshot.
It's almost dawn.
They will come.
We're here!
We're here!
Great!
Friends, listen up!
We're gonna land and hit it!
Captain, there are two unidentified ships here.
What?
We have to figure it out.
They don't look like ships full of treasures.
Don't mess with the plan, got it?
Well, guys, get to work.
They haven't appeared yet?
Besides, it's such a beautiful day.
What happened, what do you think?
Maybe they overslept?
No, they will definitely come.
We just have to wait.
Hey, guys.
If it's not my eavesdropping hallucinations,
it looks like they're screaming somewhere.
Yes, I definitely hear it well.
Now that you've noticed it.
Hey, what's going on?
Exactly, there's another northern slope.
It can't be.
Can we be on the other side?
Since they met on this side,
I suggested that they come from here.
Hey, then we have to hurry,
or they will attack the village.
Where is that slope?
Take a course from here to the north,
and in three minutes you will be there.
The landscape is very similar to this one.
We just have to stop them on the rise, but...
Everything is fine.
We'll think of something.
Damn it!
The northern slope you're talking about
is the one where our boats docked.
They will take all my treasures.
I will be there in no less than 20 seconds.
Damn it!
I was so important with this great plan,
and everything is in vain.
Hey, what are you doing?
Let's go.
We have to...
Help me!
Take your hands off me, you idiot!
I'm sorry.
In that case, I'm going ahead.
Sorry, but my treasures are in danger.
You will find the way on your own.
I'm not afraid of this woman.
Let's go.
I can't let them attack the village.
But this Luffy is so fast.
I'll be there in no less than a minute.
Take a course from here to the north.
Take a course from here to the north.
Take a course from here to the north.
If anyone dares to touch my treasures,
I will have no mercy.
What?
What's up there?
It's you.
My name is Captain Usopp.
I've been waiting for you.
I'm completely ready for battle.
Get out of here if you value your life.
What's going on?
Why did I end up here first?
This guy was supposed to be here earlier.

I'm scared of the divisions.
I can't walk past this place.
Why am I on the edge of the village?
I went to the North, so I ran there where it's colder.
You're that guy from yesterday, the one who eavesdropped on our conversation.
What are you going to do?
I'm warning you, step back immediately!
Otherwise we will destroy you from 100 million people!
From 100 million?
Hey, hey, what do you think is going on here with the kids?
What? 100 million people?
Unbelievable!
He's definitely lying, Captain!
Why did you believe him so easily?
Damn, they guessed!
Did he really think we'd buy for it?
You bastard, you dared to try to deceive me!
Captain John, there's a problem.
I see, here's the stuff.
No, it's not bad news.
We found a bunch of treasures in that boat.
They're neat here.
There are about 40 of them.
No, there were 50 million.
What?
50 million?
Why is there so much money in their boat?
These are my treasures!
I gave them to them!
What?
You gave them to us?
Exactly!
And in return for that, get out of here, please!
Now he wants to bribe us with money.
What a pathetic guy.
You're so stupid.
We're pirates.
Of course, we'll take these treasures.
But that won't make us leave.
That's a little too much.
When I say, one, two, django, you'll free the road.
That's the weapon.
One, two, django!
Stop talking nonsense!
Ouch!
What is this woman?
Captain, it's not the time to hypnotize and free the road yourself.
I own the treasures on that boat.
I won't let you grab a single Bailey.
You'd better put everything where it was.
How could you give my treasures so easily?
You shouldn't have said that!
What are you talking about?
I saved you.
Where did I save you?
I forgot to tell you that you should never look at this ring.
He's a hypnotist.
Hypnotist?
So, where's Luffy?
Wasn't he the first one here?
I have no idea.
He was either on the way or lost somewhere.
Then he really got lost.
Damn, and in such a responsible moment.
Then you'd better just listen to my command.
Attack, and I'll cover you.
Hey, why should I attack?
How can I fight against such a large crowd?
I'm just a fragile girl.
If a man is required here, don't look at me.
I'm so afraid that my legs will even shake.
So what?
I'm so afraid that I'm about to burst into tears.
Your eyes are completely dry.
If Ustina wanted to lie, she'd do it more likely.
You're completely wrong here.
We don't have time to lie to them, fool.
Get rid of them quickly.
And to the village, friends.
They're coming.
Oh, yes, I have several iron rings.
And you know some good tricks.
Come on, come on.
Come on, get it.
Rings, like this.
Damn it.
Absolutely unforgivable.
It worked.
Well, where is the northern abyss?
The northern abyss.
The northern abyss.
And where is the northern abyss?
It hurts.
Great, it works.
Now.
Meteor.
Oh, bastards.
Not bad. Take care of it, okay?
And I'll take a little break.
Hey, you haven't even hit anyone yet.
What's going on?
These things are here too.
You're stupid, how could they be here?
You're in the way.
Did you really think you could stop us?
Come on, guys.
Captain Kuro is waiting.
Yeah.
What's wrong with him?
Let me go, bastard.
Let me go.
Damn it, bastard.
Bastard.
This abyss.
I can't let you get through it.
Because I prefer to keep lying.
This village, as always, will enjoy another peaceful day.
That's why I'll never let you get through it.
Shut up, you idiot.
Oh, you.
Ouch.
You.
Stop suffering for nothing.
Hey, guys.
Forget about them.
Come on, quickly.
Or have you forgotten about Captain Kuro's plans?
If something goes wrong,
we're all dead.
Got it?
You're imbeciles.
Hey, let's hurry to the village.
Where are you going?
Stop.
Bastard.
Stop.
Stop.
Don't go into the village.
Get the hell out of here.
Stop, please.
Please don't kill them.
I love this village.
I want to protect it.
I want to protect it.
What's going on, Captain Zhang Guo?
I've never heard of such people in this village.
They finally showed up.
What's that noise?
How should I know?
I'm sick of it.
Nami.
How dare you push me down the slope?
Stop, you bastard.
You didn't tell me which side is north.
Who are they?
They're late.
They're late.
They're late.
Those bastards.
They have to understand clearly
what will happen if my plan fails.
They'll get what they deserve.
If they forget about the consequences,
I'll kill them all.
You'll serve a good time.
So you die.
This is lifeaaaall.
Why does he get on the shore so early?
