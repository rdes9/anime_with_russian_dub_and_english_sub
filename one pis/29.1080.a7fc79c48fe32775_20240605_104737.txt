You don't need them, I'll give them to you.
Look for them, I left them all there.
In pursuit of their dreams, people went to Grand Line.
Now the great era of pirates is entering.

You still won't be able to get rid of that rod that he has.
At least, this boy doesn't even have a hint of hesitation.
Is it not something that is necessary for survival?
Or does his conviction mean that he rejected death?
Are you convinced, Nest?
This is the end for you!
What? My big war spear! How did you do that?
I hit him five times in a row.
Now your spear is useless.
Well, this guy is not that bad.
Maybe he will be able to win the battle?
This is bad! He broke a big war spear!
But after all these explosions, his body will not be able to withstand too much.
Episode 29.
The result of a deadly battle. The rod is not inside.
Did you catch it now?
Is this space enough for me?
Is this space enough to grind you into powder?
What?
This is your thing. The spear is broken. Now it's just a bomb on a stick.
And its power is halved.
You think so?
Yeah.
A bomb on a stick, huh? That's not bad.
Its power is enough to shift you from here.
You carried everything away. It seems to you that it is easy to do.
No.
Look!
Ever since you dared to challenge the great Don Craig, you have been sentenced to death.
I'm not going to die, especially here.
Hey, I'm here!
Well, rat, die!
Stupid bastard!
It won't help!
How many weapons does this guy have?
Gomu Gomu Noa, machine gun!
What the hell is this?
His arms have multiplied!
Hey, waiter!
What a guy!
Useless!
Useless!
Against metal armor, your blows are useless.
They won't leave a scratch.
Gomu Gomu Noa, machine gun!
Don!
Stop it!
Useless! Useless!
This is absolutely useless!
How can you destroy these armor with just a few hundred blows of a little rat?
I thought I was done for.
He's gone.
I'm here.
Listen.
With your best weapons, your greatest strength and your most powerful weapons,
everyone will recognize you as the strongest, the strongest man.
And I will be that man!
Gomu Gomu Noa, machine gun!
Gomu Gomu Noa!
This is absolutely useless!
You won't be able to hold on to me with just persistence.
Bazooka!
Useless!
This is the limit of your endurance.
What?
He destroyed my unbreakable armor?
But it's too late.
This is the end for you, hammer boy!
It's a trap! Run!
Officer!
Useless!
The only thing you need to survive is to reject death.
Gomu Gomu Noa!
What?
Bazooka!
Great! Yeah! You're cool, officer!
I won!
You're too early to be happy, you damn bastard!
He's still alive.
Oh no!
You can't get out of this iron mesh.
You can't get out of this iron mesh.
There's a sea below us.
It will tell us which of us is the winner, hammer boy.
I'm always the last one to laugh.
This is our house, Craig.
Look at him!
My hands and legs are still free, so everything is under control.
Why didn't you just spit on everything?
Why all this?
What?
This time everything will really end.
Gomu Gomu Noa!
A helicopter!
The world is ice!
Officer!
Don Craig won!
How can he be defeated?
How?
Great, officer!
Great!
He did it!
Amazing!
Really?
But it was Don Craig.
He's really too strong.
He's something special.
What's that noise?
What's that noise?
Wake up!
He's defeated.
Your Don has lost.
What?
If you have time to sit here in complete silence, why don't you get up?
If you have time to sit here in complete silence, why don't you save him?
Huh?
He won't get up on his own, you know.
What?
Those who got him from the devil's fruits are not friends with the sea.
It becomes like a hammer in him.
What did you say, old man?
Why didn't you tell me earlier?
You will be in the answer if something happens.
What's going on?
Hey, hold on!
Didn't you refuse to die?
Don't you believe in that?
Huh?
I'm not going to die!
Don't you believe in that?
Huh?
Don't you believe in that?
Don't you believe in that?
No!
Don't you believe in that?
It's not my grave.
Damn it!
Sora!
If you knew earlier, why didn't you just run away?
That's just it!
I don't know, I'm not sure for sure, but if I took one step back, I'm sure that I would have been able to save the world.

Hey, waiter! Don't you dare die here!
Don, what's going on?
Why Don?
Don Craig lost?
Don't you believe me?
He's the king of the blu-ray.
He...
He...
He...
He...
Even if you say so, look for yourself!
Even if you say so, look for yourself!
The armor that he was so proud of is broken into pieces!
The armor that he was so proud of is broken into pieces!
Do you want to see it?
Do you want to see it?
He is the only man I have subdued.
He is the only man I have subdued.
I have always believed that he is the best.
Wait, brother!
If you move, it will spread all over your body!
If you move, it will spread all over your body!
Lie down! It's dangerous for your life!
Don't say that we didn't warn you!
Waiter! You can't die!
You can't die!
What are you doing?
Hey!
You can't just die here!
Waiter, say something!
Say something, finally!
Waiter, don't die!
Damn you!
Damn you!
Nobody is stronger than me!
Nobody is stronger than me!
I am the victor!
Nobody can surpass me!
Don, don't do it!
Don, don't do it!
It came off the coils!
Don, don't do it!
Don, don't do it!
I won thanks to my power!
I won thanks to my power!
I won thanks to my power!
I have to win!
I am the strongest man!
Don Craig, we lost.
Starpon!
Let's retreat and start over.
Thank you for everything, Sanji-san.
Sanji-san, tell him about me when he wakes up.
Tell him that we will meet again at the Grand Line.
Well, I thought a lot about this.
This is the only thing I want to do.
I do not know exactly when the ambitions of Don Craig became the same as mine, but ...
Maybe I have only a few hours left to live.
It's pretty strange for me to announce my decision to leave the Grand Line.
But now I want to do what I want, relying on my own instincts.
Now I will not run away anymore.
What kind of loyalty did I keep for Don Craig?
I just used his name as a cover to have the opportunity to hide.
When you decide something, you pay less attention to such things.
Like fear of a strong opponent or the question of your own life.
This is what he taught me.
Party!
Give him a slipper on which we bring food.
Are you serious? How can we give a pirate a slipper?
And how do you think we will get the food, idiot?
Exactly!
You just need to swim in the sea!
Shut up and do it!
All right!
You should not yell at us!
Got it! We'll do everything now!
We'll do it!
Oh, he's drowning! We're going to drown!
I used to worry about every little thing.
I used to feel very stupid doing that.
Bye! I'll take this.
I don't have to return it, do I?
No!
Try it if you dare, you bastard!
Hey, now remember!
This is the battle swimming restaurant Baratti!
What a nasty crowd!
They're really nice people.
We'll meet again.
I'm going swimming with her!
Did you go?
Oh!
I didn't.
I don't have to either.
Why?
When we meet next time, I wonder if they will take me in their team.
I don't know if I'll have such a chance.
I want to be free!

I'm thinking of going to the front line someday.
Then let's go now!
It's not the right time yet!
Next time on One Piece!
On a journey!
With Rufy in the sea!
I will become the king of pirates!
