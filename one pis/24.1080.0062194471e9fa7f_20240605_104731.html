Look for them!
I left them all there!
In pursuit of their dreams, people went to Grand Climb.
Now the world is entering the great era of pirates!

Not only cruel, but also strong.
There were times when he was unnoticed.
But recently I heard that he has regained his activity.
28 million was certainly attractive.
But he is too strong to handle even with us easily.
Nami, Aniki.
I'm sorry, but I would like to change quickly, so that you two could not turn away.
Wait a minute.
Can't we go right now?
Please, as much as you want.
She is quite brave.
If you look at her a little, there will be no more trouble, right?
What are you doing?
You ask what?
Business, of course.
I'm a thief who steals from pirates.
So I'm taking this ship.
I never said that I was one of them.
I just cooperated with them.
Although it was a rather short friendship with Luffy and the rest, I got pleasure from her.
Give it to them, it's from me.
If it is destined, then we will meet again.
Nami, Aniki.
This is a complication.
We were asked to look after the ship.
And that's how we lost the ship.
Forgive us.
Damn, she used us.
This ship is too good for us.
Wait, I see him.
This is Goenck Mary.
Where is your ship?
It still exists, but ...
Zoro, Usopp, go quickly.
Stop us.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Go quickly.
Stop us using their ship.
It doesn't make sense.
Let them fall through.
There is no need to chase this woman.
I can't live without her, without my navigator.
Okay.
What kind of hemorrhoid captain?
Hey, Usopp, let's go.
Yes.
Nami, Aniki, the ship is ready.
Luffy, what about you?
I haven't completely repaired this restaurant, so I can't leave yet.
Be careful.
Something is wrong here.
Yes, I know.
What happened?
The ship is broken in half.
Look, over there.
It's him.
Don Craig.
This is the man.
The man who destroyed our fleet.
This is ...
This is ...
This is the bastard.
He came so far to kill us.
We are doomed.
Zurok, who is he?
Who is he?
The man I'm looking for.
The eye of Takano.
The eye of Takano?
Some kind of god.
The world's strongest man.
The world's strongest man.
This is the man who easily drowned Craig's front line, who challenged the Grand Line.
And he just destroyed Craig's ship.
But he is no different from ordinary people.
And it doesn't look like he has some kind of special weapon.
His weapon is behind him.
It can't be.
You don't want to say.
He destroyed this huge ship with this sword.
He is the strongest fictive eye.
Fictive eye over all fictive eye in the world.
I never thought I could meet him so soon.
Finally, the time has come.
The time has come.
You bastard!
Why did you attack us?
To kill time.
Shit!
What?
I'm sure he didn't miss.
The bullets dodged in the way.
He dodged them by turning his sword.
That's ridiculous!
Hey, who are you?
Katana-san!
Could it be?
I've never seen such a sharp skill.
A sword without power is not strong.
So this ship was cut to pieces with this sword?
Of course.
Now it's obvious that you're stronger.
That's right.
I went across the sea to see you.
What's your goal?
To be the best.
You bastard!
Do you have some free time?
Let's fight.
This man.
Zoro.
What?
A hunter for pirates?
This guy?
The further, the worse, Luffy.
The war with the sea will soon be revealed.
Hey, Luffy!
Fight?
What a pathetic bastard.
If you really were a good fighter,
you could evaluate the strength of the enemy without taking the sword.
Calling me?
Are you so brave or senseless?
This is for my own ambitions.
And as a promise to my dead friend,
the greatest victor of the world,
Mikhail Sokalin and his eyes,
against the hunter on the pirate Zoro.
What kind of battle will it be?
No one can stand against Aniki.
Aniki is the best!
What?
Hey, what does that mean?
I'm not one of those idiots
who use the full arsenal to chase rabbits.
Although it is well known enough to be called a fictivist.
This is the weakest of the four oceans of East Blue.
Unfortunately, I don't wear anything less than this.
Stop teasing me!
Don't you have to regret it after death?
You are not yet the one who experienced the real world.
Oni, take this!
What?
Zoro!
Aniki's demonic technique was broken.
But it works 100% in cases.
What happened?
I can't move.
What just happened?
No one has been able to avoid this technique yet.
But now he is with this toy.
Did this really happen?
Is his skill so far away?
It can't be.
It can't be so incomparable.
The world can't be so imperfect.
This can't be Aniki!
Please, don't be so serious!
Aniki!
It's impossible to be so unattainable.
Sounding and adaptation of the Animedia.TV project.
Sounded by Shachiburi.
What an incomparable skill!
Today, this thing is beating all three swords of Zoro.
This is the most monstrous monster.
I couldn't resist this desire to lose this toy.
Zoro!
You're a lucky guy, Zoro, because you're a boy.
I also want to become the best fictitious person in the world.
I also want to become the best fictitious person in the world.
If only, if only I was born a boy.
After the victory over me, don't say such pathetic things.
It's shameful.
You are my highest goal, Zoro.
Promise me.
One day, someone or you or I will become the greatest fictitious person in the world.
Promise me.
I swear.
I will become the greatest fictitious person in the world.
I will become stronger for her too.
My power will reach the heavens.
I'm going to become the strongest in the world.
We promised.
I...
I'm going to become the strongest in the world.
If I can't beat this man...
What did you do?
Why do you try to become the strongest of the weak?
I'll teach you a couple of lessons!
Stop!
Don't get in Johnny's way!
Just wait!
Truffy!
I can't afford to lose!
Truffy!
Great!
The greatest fake-comrade in the world, right?
If the companion of the Pirate King will be someone less, I will be in trouble!
Do you want this thing to pierce your heart?
Why didn't you step back?
I don't know.
I'm not quite sure.
But if I took one step back,
it seems to me that all the important vows and promises and many other decisions given to her so far
will be lost and I will never be able to become like before before this meeting.
Yes, and this is called defeat.
That's why I can't step back.
Even if it means death,
death can be better.
What kind of strong will
prefers death to defeat?
Child, say your name!
Rarenozoro!
I'll remember this!
I haven't met such a strong will for a long time.
As a gift of respect!
I will use this black sword
to my worthy opponent
the most powerful sword in the world
to break your life.
I appreciate it.
He stabbed him!
The sword that cuts ships!
This is my last chance.
First in the world or death!
Enough, Aniki!
Please don't!
Santoryu!
I'm coming!
Santensukai!
I lost.
Defeat is not something I can even imagine.
That's what it's like to have the greatest power in the world.
And now what?
It's a shame to attack from behind
for fictivals.
Well said.
Zora!
Don't rush to death, young man.
Zora!
Aniki!
Aniki!
Why?
When I decided to become the greatest fictival in the world
I gave up on life.
This guy and his stupid thoughts
his opponent was really the strongest in the world
and that was obvious.
Why didn't you give up on your ambitions
that lead to inevitable death?
This is the power of the Grand Line.
The power of the world.
Even the hunter Zora was powerless.
Damn it!
Damn it!
Aniki!
What the hell?
This guy has the power of the devil fruit?
This guy has the power of the devil fruit?
Bastard!
Are you a member of this young fictivals?
Thank you for watching over them.
Don't worry, this young man is still alive.
Aniki! Aniki!
Say something!
Zora!
Zora!
Let's get him on board.
There's medicine here, use it quickly.
It's too early for you to die.
My name is Juraku Mihawk.
Find your true self, the real world.
Become stronger.
No matter how long it takes,
I will wait in my strongest form.
Surpass this sword.
Surpass me.
Rarino Zora!
Aniki! Aniki!
Say something!
How can you say such words to Mihawk?
Kid, what's your goal?
Pirate King!
This is a difficult path of regret.
How can you surpass me?
What's the difference?
I'm going to become stronger.
He's alive!
He just lost consciousness.
Aniki!
Aniki, say something!
Zora!
Aniki!
Luffy, can you hear me?
Yes!
I'm sorry I made you worry.
If I don't become the best fencing player in the world,
you'll be in a difficult situation, right?
Aniki, don't say anything else!
Aniki!
I...
I'll never...
I won't lose again!
Until I beat him
and become the best fencer in the world,
I'll never be defeated again!
Any problems with that?
Pirate King!
No!
Good team.
I hope we'll meet again.
Wait, Sakalina and the Eyes!
Didn't you come for my head?
I'll beat you better with Don Craig's head!
It was my original intention,
but I've had enough of it.
I'm going back to sleep.
Maybe you had enough fun,
but I still had enough.
Don, why did you stop him?
Die before you leave!
He's gone.
Stop!
Puffy!
Go and take care of Nami.
When it's done,
I and Zora will return Nami.
And you make this cuckoo join us.
Then we'll have five and we'll go to the Grand Line.
Okay, go!
Guys!
The retreat is over and the real battle begins.
We'll get this ship.
Yes!
I'm worried about you.
Can we go now?
Do whatever you want.
THE END
THE END
