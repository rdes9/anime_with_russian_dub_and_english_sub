        <pre>If you need them, I'll give them to you!
Look for them! I left them all there!
In pursuit of their dreams, people went to the Grand Line!
Now the world is being invaded by a great number of pirates!
One Piece!
One Piece!
One Piece!
Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire!
Zura!
A cowardly attack!
Big Red Nose!
A cowardly attack!
Big Red Nose!
Hey, Zura, you're wounded!
Shut up and be quiet!
I'm doing my best!
What is he thinking about?
Luffy, who is this?
Ah, this is our navigator!
Are you kidding me?
What kind of people are you?
Back off!
Stay on the road!
Episode 6
An unreliable situation!
The monster mojo user Luffy is hanged!
Why are you trying so hard?
You're just a pirate!
These three beat me too easily!
You must be kidding me!
Without a doubt, this is an announcement of war to me!
You're here, Moji!
Rorono Zora's head wants me to bring it!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
What's wrong with this dog?
Dog!
Hey, Zura!
It doesn't move at all!
Who cares?
Let it do whatever it wants!
Is it cold?
Let it do whatever it wants!
Is it dead?
Don't do that!
Let it go!
Do you understand the situation?
Damn dog!
I lost a lot of blood!
Hello, navigator!
I guess I'll give you this...
...for saving me earlier.
Oh, the key to the cage!
Did you get it for me?
Understand me correctly!
I don't want to be obliged to anyone, and that's it!
I'll save you!
Damn it!
Damn it!
Don't you dare eat it!
It's not food!
Spit it out!
Spit it out!
Spit the key out!
Damn it!
Damn it!
Don't swallow it!
Spit it out!
Where is it?
Hey!
Stop barking!
Bastard!
Shushu!
Who are you, uncle?
I'm the mayor of this city!
Who are you?
I'm the mayor of this city!
I'm the mayor of this city!
Who are you?
Oh my God!
You're pretty seriously injured!
Did the Bugs attack you?
You need to show it to the doctor immediately!
How is Zora?
I told him that I would take him to the doctor.
But he replied that he would be fine if he slept.
Shushu.
Shushu.
Is that's Shushu's name?
Just sitting here, what is he doing?
Watching the store.
Are you Missa?
Yes.
This is a dog food store.
It's a pet store!
It is.
His owner was a good friend of mine.
I've been feeding him here.
Here?
Yes.
He died three months after the disease.
Could it be that he's waiting for his master to come back?
That's what everyone says.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
That's what everyone says.
I'm not so sure about that.
Shushu is a smart dog, and he perfectly understands that his master is already dead.
Then why is he guarding the store?
Because for Shushu, this store is a treasure.
His master left a store on him, so he protects it.
Episode 4
What's that scream?
It's Moji, the monster stealer!
What monster stealer? Wait a minute!
Something is approaching.
Give me the key.
Oh, so your friends left you?
You should have just run away.
Who are you?
I'm Moji, the monster stealer from the buggy gang.
You're dressed in a very strange costume.
Grubyan, these are my hair.
And these are even funnier.
You!
Even with me, you are still so insolent.
You don't know how great I am?
I'm Moji, the monster stealer.
And there is no beast in the world that I could not tame.
Shiver!
One way or another, you will die soon.
I'm not interested in stealing you now.
Tell me, where is Ranozora?
Kill him, Ritchie!
Great! The cage is broken!
Ready.
Okay, Ritchie, let's go look for Zora.
When we beat him, we will become even more famous.
What is it?
And this is a food store for animals.
If you want to have a snack, let's go faster.
What?
Don't tell me that this dog is really guarding this store.
Oh.
He caught me in a trap.
But I finally freed myself from the cage.
Great!
Okay, now I'll show them where Raki is wintering.
And we will become our navigators.
How can you still be alive?
He's alive!
Is it bad that I'm alive?
Why did you come to this city?
Why did you contact these pirates?
Why? I just found out.
To get the Grand Line map and the navigator.
That man in a black suit said he was looking for Zora.
I'll go figure it out.
Shushu, the store belongs to us both.
Shushu, this bag is too big for you.
Shushu, what am I going to do if you get hurt?
Give it to me.
No, Shushu, I told you not to eat food in the store.
Now you eat.
Oh, he's still moving.
Shushu, I'm getting old.
I'm not too healthy.
But I'll get better.
Take care of yourself when I'm gone.
I'll leave the store to you.
Sound the adaptation of the anime-media.tv project.
Sounded by Shachiburi.
Shushu, the store belongs to us both.
Shushu, the store belongs to us both.
Shushu, you're so cute.
This store is precious to Shushu.
His owner left a store for him, so he protects it.
Damn, this dog really kicked my ass.
Hey, didn't I just kill you?
I wasn't going to die from such a thing.
And this time I'll eat your head.
Lev can't do anything to me!
Gomu Gomu No!
Stop!
Ritchie!
Who the hell are you?
I...
ate a rubber fruit.
No way!
How could you, like Bagi's captain,
eat a devil fruit?
I'm not a fool.
I'm sorry.
I was wrong.
I'll fix it.
It's too late to apologize.
I can't return this dog's treasure.
That's why
I'll make you regret it.
To be continued...
These or the others.
All pirates are the same.
I didn't expect to destroy
the most precious thing for people.
Hey, pirate!
Are you still alive?
I thought that Lev
had already digested you.
You're a pirate!
You do the same!
Before you collect
a big ball to fight!
I'll kill you now!
Hey, stop, girl!
You don't have the strength
to kill me.
I haven't tried yet!
Stop it!
What happened to you?
This is all
I managed to return.
I've already eaten the rest.
He...
He fought with the lion
only because of the dog.
You really fought bravely.
I can say that,
even though I didn't see it.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Yeah!
Good luck to you too!
You were defeated!
I-I'm sorry,
Captain Buggy.
Moji!
Zoro defeated you,
didn't he?
No, not Zoro,
but this guy with the straw hat.
What?
Did Mugiwara
defeat you?
He's rubber.
Enough of me!
Prepare a buggy-bomb!
Destroy this city!
I'm sorry,
Captain Buggy.
I thought you were sick.
Come on!
You have your reasons.
Although I don't want
to hear about them.
I'm so useless.
Even Shusha and this guy
fought.
And I, the mayor,
don't do anything
to save the city.
Mr. Buggy,
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Mr. Mayor,
calm down.
Forty years ago,
this place was a field.
We all worked together
to build houses
and shops.
This is how this city was born.
Any citizen,
any part of the city,
is a treasure for me.
I can't let anyone
do what they want
with the city.
Damn!
Destroy this city!
This is my house!
Zoro is still sleeping there!
Is he dead?
Hey, Zoro!
Are you still alive?
What a terrible way
to seduce a person!
I was going to sleep
a little longer.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Why is he still alive?
Thank God,
you're alive.
Such things are not forgiven.
I can't take it anymore.
They have no right
to ruin forty years
of hard work.
I am the mayor of this city!
I will protect this city!
Wait, Mr. Mayor!
As a man,
I will fight until the end!
I'm a good guy!
Absolutely, uncle!
Don't hurt him!
What can you do
against that man?
It's crazy!
I know it's crazy!
Wait for me, buggy clown!
The mayor was crying.
Really?
I didn't notice.
It seems that time is running out.
That's right!
It's not time to laugh!
Don't worry,
I liked this guy.
I won't let him die.
And if you say so...
And you go!
With such a wound!
Such wounds!
Such wounds
cause more damage to my honor
than my body!
Our goal is Grand Line!
We must take back
the map from those pirates!
Be our friend,
Nami!
I won't become a pirate!
But I will join you, guys,
for our two goals!
The second one is ready!
Okay, fire!
Buggy clown,
come out!
I'm Mayor Poodle!
I'm Mayor Poodle!
I came to protect
my precious city!
I will fight with you!
Are you an idiot?
The only precious thing
is gold and precious stones!
Is this city a treasure?
You are a piece of shit!
You bastard!
You will never understand
my feelings!
I'm a man who almost
entered the Grand Line
and took all the treasures of the world!
All the treasures of the world
belong to me!
No one else
will get them!
Since this city
is so important to you,
I will let you
disappear with it!
First, fight with me,
you bastard!
Don't make me laugh!
I won't let you
destroy this city!
Even the price of my own life!
I'll kill you!
Mugiwara!
As I promised,
I came to kick your ass!
