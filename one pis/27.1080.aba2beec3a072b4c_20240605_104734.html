        <pre>You need them, I'll give them to you.
Look for them! I left them all there!
In pursuit of their dreams, people went to Grand Climb.
The great era of pirates comes to the world!
One Piece
Grand Climb
Grand Climb
Grand Climb
Sanja-san, please leave the ship.
I don't want to kill you.
I'm not leaving.
I'm the one who took everything from this old man.
In order for me to live,
his strength,
his dreams...
This restaurant is a treasure of the old man.
If I...
If I don't sacrifice my life for this, I won't be able to repay the old man.
Goma, Goma, come on!
Stop! Don't interfere!
Come on!
Episode 27.
Who the hell knows? They didn't translate it again.
Fucking idiots.
This is bullshit.
The sailor!
The sailor is destroyed!
This guy...
Is he going to destroy the ship?
Gin!
Spread his head!
Hurry up!
Hurry up!
Hurry up!
Hurry up!
Hurry up!
But...
But...
But he gave enough food for our people.
Gin, you bastard!
Hey!
I wasn't going to bother you.
I broke the sailor.
Officer, you're an idiot!
What are you trying to achieve?
To drown him.
What?
I'm going to drown the ship.
Are you kidding me?
Idiot!
I think you were going to say something completely different.
Idiot, are you serious?
If I destroy the ship, they won't be able to get it.
And what do you know about it?
What do you know about my merciless debt to this place?
Are you going to die for this?
Are you an idiot?
What did you say?
It's stupid.
You can't repay him with death.
He didn't extend your life for that.
He saved you, so you have to live.
And you're an idiot, trying to kill yourself.
Only the weak can do that.
Then what the hell do you suggest?
Hey, you two.
Stop arguing.
It's just funny to fight with each other at such a moment.
Because while you're in our hands, you still can't take anything.
What a bad luck for you to meet us, Don Craig's pirates.
And now let me burn you to the ground with my firepower.
Gin!
Why?
Gin!
I'm sorry, Par.
Just stay out of it.
Gin!
Are you trying to betray me?
I'm sorry, Don Craig.
This man saved us.
I don't want to kill him like this.
At least.
At least!
Let me finish him off with my own hands.
Have you lost your mind?
My senior combat assistant of my pirate fleet?
Master, are you all right?
Master, come to your senses.
Senior assistant?
So he's not a regular member of the gang?
He broke the shield of the Iron Panzer.
What a terrible force.
Look!
You see how successful my deceitful, threatening plan was?
Stop lying!
Do you really want to destroy the ship?
Sanji-san!
I wanted you to get out of the ship, because I don't want to cripple you.
But it doesn't seem to happen.
Yes, I don't want to leave.
This restaurant, I won't let you take it even for the rest of your life.
Then at least let me kill you with my own hands.
You can't do that.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
It's about you too, Mugiwara.
Not necessarily.
Because I don't want to defeat such a bunch of weaklings like you.
You moron!
How dare you say that about our starpom?
You call him weakling in the face?
We are the pirates of Dona Krayga, the strongest of them all.
Don't you think that the weaklings are the majority here?
Yes.
It seems that your opinion has touched them.
Yes, that's right.
We will finish these guys ourselves.
From the road!
Don Krayga!
But...
But...
When someone is worried about the fact that he was called weakling,
it is proof that he is really weakling.
Let the events begin to determine the weakness of the strength.
I'm still here.
So don't fuss.
Yes.
Gin.
Kill this cuckold on you.
And this bold boy Molotov,
leave it to me.
I agree, Don Krayga.
Hey, kid.
I'll show you the strength of the defeated East Blue.
And it doesn't matter what you ate the devil's fruit.
You will understand that it is useless.
You will never shut up.
I don't want to attack you, and that's it.
Well, shall we start?
Just wait here.
Are you sure?
This guy is no different from weakness.
I'm sorry.
This time with this cuckold will be over.
If Ginzan took up this weapon, he's not kidding.
They call him the devil's man.
As his opponent will not ask for mercy,
he will definitely kill him without hesitation.
The devil's man.
A man without feelings.
I'm sorry, Sanji-san.
You can't beat me.
We'll see.
Here you are.
Sanji!
What did I tell you?
You can't beat me.
Goodbye.
At least get out of this world.
The commander is just great.
Kill him, Ginzan.
Sanji!
Die!
Die!
The adaptation of the anime-media.tv project has been announced.
Shachi has been announced.
This cuckold dealt with Ginzan with just one blow.
Even Ginzan couldn't beat him.
Idiots.
Why are you still clapping your eyes?
Gin is a man of the devil, worthy of my praise.
That's why I appointed him as the senior assistant.
Soon he will demonstrate his power.
Sanji, are you all right?
How can he be all right?
From the beginning of the battle with this iron shell,
he has already received five or six strong blows.
Nothing good, Asmino Jin.
Senior assistant, is that all you've got?
That's right.
That's why I appointed him as the senior assistant.
Soon he will demonstrate his power.
That's all you've got?
Why is he looking there?
Great!
I must use this opportunity to kick his ass.
It's not so early.
I must use this opportunity to kick his ass.
You bastard!
Are you going to fight me or not?
Fight you?
I don't need that.
I use the means of killing people.
Remember, it's a stinking monkey.
What?
You'd better be careful when you fight a monkey.
Now this guy is seriously injured.
Kill him.
Damn!
If only the iron shell didn't knock him down.
He's been hit ten times by this steel shell.
It doesn't hurt at all.
It's a trifle.
I'm exhausted.
This guy is really strong.
Get ready for the end.
I've had enough.
What's that?
A pity?
Are you kidding me?
Ginzan!
Sanji!
Sanji!
He can't take it anymore.
His body can't take even his own attacks.
Great!
Kill him, Gin!
Shit!
I can't.
I can't.
What the hell?
It's me.
Don Craig.
Honestly.
I can't kill this man.
Don Craig.
Gin.
I really can't.
I really can't.
I really can't kill him.
What did you say?
Because it's me.
It's me.
It's me.
For the first time.
It's even worse.
I don't accept mercy.
Take it away.
Don't be so stubborn.
Just eat it.
For me, any hungry person is a visitor.
I'm sorry.
I can't pay for this.
I'm better than anyone else.
What is dying from hunger?
You can die for your pride.
But if you don't eat, you won't survive and you won't see tomorrow's dawn.
It's disgusting.
It's so delicious.
It's too delicious.
I thought I was going to die.
I thought I was going to die.
It's so delicious.
It's the first time I've eaten something so delicious.
So you liked it.
I'm sorry I'm causing trouble.
Because you fed me for free.
But now there's no evidence left, right?
It's the first time someone was so kind to me.
That's why I can't kill this person.
At any time.
I know.
I was never going to betray you.
I don't think it's a mistake.
Everything we've done so far...
I respect your strength and thank you.
I'm happy that you appreciated my strength and appointed me as a senior assistant.
That's why I do what you say.
I will continue to do this in the future.
But...
But...
I just can't kill this person.
Don Craig.
I beg you.
Couldn't you just leave this restaurant alone?
You bastard!
Not only did you obey my orders,
but you also dare to point out what to do to me?
You really want to die, don't you?
I'm very disappointed in you.
Didn't I always say that?
That I hate all these morals.
The rest fall on one side.
Don, that's...
MH5!
Poison gas?
What?
Poison gas?
Masks!
Quickly put on your masks, or we're all dead.
Apply this weapon, you bastard!
Do you know the consequences of his use?
Enough talking.
This is a battle.
The goal is to win.
Faithfully.
Lowly.
Don't you think it's acceptable?
The goal is victory.
The method doesn't matter, only victory is important.
It doesn't matter to me what consequences the poison gas will cause.
As long as I win.
This is strength.
What a bastard.
Throw out your mask!
You're not one of my people anymore.
You have to die!
I won't let you release the poison gas!
Don't interfere, young boy.
Damn it!
Gin!
I've never heard such cowardly words!
I'm going to destroy him!
Don't you dare, Don Kreig!
He's the strongest among the living.
You can't defeat him.
You're an idiot, open your eyes!
This guy wants to kill you!
Of course.
For me to talk about my feelings is a betrayal of my role.
That's why...
That's why the result is obvious.
Gin!
Why?
Why?
You did it after all, didn't you?
But it's too late.
Die along with this cuckoo.
Poison gas!
M-H-5!
Dive underwater!
Master, to the restaurant, quickly!
I owe this!
Sanji Gin, this is for you!
Waiter!
And now for me!
Ah!
Everyone's underwater!
The sequel follows.
The sequel follows.
The sequel follows.
The sequel follows.
I'll teach you who's a fool!
I can't stop my ambition with this useless weapon!
Why don't you take a nap?
You don't even know that?
Are you a fool?
What did you say?
Say it again!
Are you stupid?
Say it again!
You told me to say it.
You're an idiot.
Next time on One Piece!
I don't know!
Fighting Ruby vs. Greek!
I will become the king of pirates!
