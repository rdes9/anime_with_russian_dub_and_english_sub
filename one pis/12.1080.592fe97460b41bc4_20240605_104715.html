I'm the girl
we are
No!
I'm not lying, damn it!
Those pirates are really going to attack, aren't they?
Without a doubt, they will attack.
But everyone thinks it's a prank.
I hate this village, I want to protect everyone.
Okay, we're coming with you.
This is the pirate ring of Kurokodolo.
Of course, I'm afraid.
What's going on?
We won't laugh.
If it were, I would like to risk my life.
Episode 12
Battle! Pirate ring of Kuroneko. Battle on the slope.
Listen, they're going to attack the village tomorrow morning from the side of this hill,
because only this way you can get into the village.
In other places, there are cliffs.
In other places, there are cliffs,
because only this way you can get into the village.
Because only this way you can get into the village.
This is the only way,
this is the only way,
and if your enemy goes into the village,
In other places, there is no other way to attack, in other words, if we take this slope, they will not come to the village.
I see, it sounds simple.
It's easy to say, but for the battle we need real strength.
What talents do you have?
Cutting, stretching, stealing.
And I will hide.
You will fight!
I'm kidding, I just supported you guys.
Welcome back, Kurokado-san.
Where is the lady?
She is already asleep.
She looked so exhausted.
However, I never thought that such a thing could happen in my absence.
This boy is really a liar.
Yes, he even claimed that you are a pirate.
What a ridiculous invention.
Of course.
What is this?
Ah, this is a gift from the lady.
Three long years have passed since you became a part of this house.
This is a anniversary gift.
Anniversary?
It seems that your glasses are constantly slipping.
It seems that your glasses are constantly slipping.
So these are specially made for you by order of the lady.
She is so caring and attentive.
By the way, about the anniversary.
Tomorrow will be a memorable day.
Huh?
The moon is damaged tonight, isn't it?
Huh?
Such nights make my chest tremble and my blood boil in excitement.
Kurokado-san, what are you doing with the lady's gift?
I accepted the gift.
But this is not only a small thing.
This is the whole state of the whole.
What are you talking about?
There is no need to play this role anymore.
In a few hours an accident will happen.
These three years were too long.
Ladies, run!
Oh, the lamb died.

Captain Django!
He is alive!
Get up, Captain Django!
Cap, good morning.
Good morning.
Idiots!
Good morning.
According to my book, you should speak only in the morning.
Looks like he's in a bad mood.
Maybe it's because he just woke up.
Look, the moon is still high in the sky, so it's still midnight.
Remember, this is a fortress.
Were you wrong?
We ask for forgiveness.
Until you get used to it.
Good morning, everyone.
You can't say good morning to yourself.
It just means that Cap is in a good mood now, and that's it.
I see.
Don't turn your head when you're talking to people.
Friends!
It's time to act!
Okay, great!
Now they won't be able to climb up the slope.
The oil puddle will do its job.
When they don't slip on the oil, we'll jump out and destroy them all.
Oil, huh?
In any case, all we need is to protect this climb.
But we have to be careful not to slip ourselves.
Otherwise, it will be like getting into the sand.
You're pretty good at this trap.
Of course I'm good at it.
I'm completely confident in myself with this trap and my skill in shooting.
It's almost dawn.
They will come.
失踪
失踪
失踪
We're on the spot!
Great!
Now listen up, friends!
Let's get out of here and do what we came up with!
Captain!
We're calling you!
Captain!
Captain!
Captain!
Captain!
Captain!
Captain!
Captain!
Captain!
Captain!
Captain!
Captain!
Captain!
Captain!
Captain!
Captain!
Captain!
Captain!
Captain!
Captain!
Captain!
Captain!
Captain!
No! They'll come for sure! We just have to wait a little bit longer.
Hey, guys!
If it's not my eavesdropping hallucinations, it seems like they're screaming somewhere.
Yes, I definitely hear it well.
Now that you've noticed it...
Hey, what's going on?
There's another slope north of here!
It can't be!
Could we be on the other side of the river?
Since we met on this side, I thought they'd come from here.
Hey, then we have to hurry or they'll attack the village.
Where's that slope?
Take a course from here to the north and you'll be there in three minutes.
The landscape is very similar to this one.
We just have to stop them on the rise, but...
It's all right. We'll figure something out.
Damn it!
The slope north of which you're talking about is the one where our boats were docked!
They'll weigh all my treasures!
I'll be there in no less than 20 seconds!
Damn it!
I was so busy with this great plan and everything was in vain!
My treasures!
Hey!
What are you doing? Let's go!
We have to...
Help me! I'm going to slip!
Take your hands off me, you idiot!
Sorry!
In that case, I'm going ahead!
Sorry, but my treasures are in danger!
You'll find the way on your own!
I won't let this woman go!
I can't let them attack the village!
But this Luffy is so fast!
I'll be there in no less than 20 seconds!
The slope north!
The slope north!
The slope north!
If anyone dares to touch my treasures,
I'll be very merciful!
What? What's up there?
It's you!
My name is Captain Usob!
I've been waiting for you!
I'm fully prepared for battle!
Get out of here if you value your life!
What's going on?
Why did I end up here first?
This is the first time I've been here!
What's going on?
What's going on?
Why did I end up here first?
This is the first time I've been here!
I'm afraid of the division!
I can't get through this place!
Why am I on the outskirts of the village?
It's strange!
He said to go north, so I ran to where it's colder!
You're that guy from yesterday!
The guy who listened to our conversation!
What are you going to do?
I'm warning you!
Retreat immediately!
Otherwise we and a hundred million people will destroy you!
A hundred million?
Hey, hey!
What does he think he's doing here with the kids?
What?
A hundred million people?
Unbelievable!
He's lying, Captain!
Why did you believe him so easily?
Damn, they guessed it!
Did he really think we'd buy it?
You bastard!
How dare you try to fool me!
Captain Jongo, there's a problem!
I see, here's the stuff!
No, it's not a bad video!
It's not a bad video!
It's not a bad video!
No, it's not a bad video!
We found a bunch of treasures in that boat!
There are a lot of them!
There are about forty of them!
No, there were fifty million of them!
What?
Fifty million?
Why is there so much money in their boat?
These are my treasures!
I gave them to them!
What?
You gave them to us?
Exactly!
And in return for this, get out of here!
Please!
Now he wants to bribe us with money!
What a pathetic guy!
You're so stupid!
We're pirates!
Of course we'll take these treasures!
But that won't make us leave!
That's a little too much!
When I say one, two, Jongo!
You'll free the road!
It's that weapon!
One, two, three!
Stop messing around!
What's that woman?
Captain, it's not the time to hypnotize and free the road yourself!
The treasures on that boat belong to me!
I won't let you grab any of Bailey!
You better put everything where it was!
How could you just give away my treasures like that?
You shouldn't have said that!
What are you talking about?
Where did I save you?
I forgot to tell you that you should never look at this ring!
He's a hypnotist!
Hypnotist?
And where's Luffy?
Wasn't he the first one here?
I have no idea!
He's either on his way or he's lost somewhere!
Then he really is lost!
Damn, and at such a crucial moment...
Then you'd better just listen to my commands!
Attack, and I'll cover you!
Hey, why should I attack?
How can I fight against such a large crowd?
I'm just a fragile girl!
If a man is required here, don't look at me!
I'm so afraid that my legs will even shake!
Look!
So what?
I'm so afraid that I'm about to burst into tears!
Your eyes are completely dry!
If Ustina thought she was lying, then she's probably lying!
You're totally wrong here!
We don't have time to be fooling around with them!
Get rid of them immediately!
And to the village, my friends!
They're coming!
Oh yeah, I have a few iron rings!
And you know some good tricks!
Come on, come on!
Come on, get it!
Iron rings!
Like this!
Damn it!
Absolutely unforgivable!
I did it!
Damn it!
And where is the northern abyss?
The course to the north!
The course to the north!
The course to...
And where is the north?
It hurts!
Great!
It's working!
Now!
Meteor!
Oh, bastards!
Not bad!
Take care of it, okay?
I'll take a little break.
Hey, you haven't even hit anyone yet!
What's going on?
These things are here too!
You're stupid!
How could they get here?
You're in the way!
Did you really think you could stop us?
Come on, guys!
Captain Kuro is waiting!
Yeah!
What's wrong with him?
I don't know.
I don't know what's wrong with him.
I don't know what's wrong with him.
I don't know what's wrong with him.
I don't know what's wrong with him.
What's wrong with him?
Let me go!
Bastard!
Let me go!
Damn it!
Bastard!
Bastard!
This detour...
I can't let you pass it!
Because I prefer to continue to lie,
as I've always done.
This village, as always,
will enjoy the next peaceful day.
That's why!
I will never let you pass!
Shut up, you idiot!
Oh, you!
Ouch!
You!
Stop suffering!
Hey, guys!
Forget about them!
Let's go!
Or have you forgotten about Captain Kuro's plan?
If something goes wrong,
we're all dead!
Do you understand?
You're imbeciles!
Hey!
Let's hurry to the village!
Stop!
Damn it!
Stop!
Stop!
Don't go to the village!
Get off already!
Stop, please!
Please don't kill them!
I love this village!
I want to protect it!
What's going on, Captain Zhang Guo?
I've never heard of such people in this village!
They finally showed up!
What's going on?
How should I know?
I'm sick of it!
Nami!
How dare you push me down the slope!
You bastard!
You didn't tell me which side is north!
Who are they?
They're late!
Those bastards!
They should know what will happen if my plan fails!
They'll get what they deserve!
If they forget about the consequences...
I'll kill them all!
The village
It's Kurohado from the mansion!
Why is he going to the shore so early?
