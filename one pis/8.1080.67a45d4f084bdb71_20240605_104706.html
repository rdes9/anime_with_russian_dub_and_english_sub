After chasing their dreams, people went to the Grand Climb.
The great era of pirates enters the Neymar!

It's cool, and you wanna be my friend
We are, we are on the crew
We are...
Die!
Oni, take this!
Be a dead cook!
Not a cook, a pirate!
There's a Grand Line map!
The Grand Line!
I will never forgive him!
Episode 8. Who will win?
The decisive battle between the forces of the devil fruits!
I have never met a man who would make me happy like him!
Shanks deprived me of most of my treasures!
I don't know what kind of relationship you have with him, but I have the right to say everything I think about him!
Give it to him! Don't back off!
North Pole!
No, South Pole!
Repeat!
I'll repeat it as many times as I want, because I'm right!
And fighting to find out who is right is weak!
Hey!
Come on, I'll do it right now!
Stop it!
North Pole or South Pole? What's the difference? Which one is colder?
If you really want to know, why don't you go there and check it out?
A ship!
It's approaching from the north!
Okay, get ready! It's time to fight!
Okay, I'll go get everything I can reach!
You look happy, Buggie!
Of course!
Enemy ships, he's like a soldier with treasures!
Pirates are enriched by others, right?
Well, that's just one of the reasons.
No, no, no, no!
You and all the pirates on this ship are too naive!
The pirates' job is to take the treasure from people!
You don't understand anything in pirate life!
What is it?
It's a treasure map!
I've never seen anything like this!
Amazing!
It's locked deep in the sea!
Okay!
Now my life is getting more exciting!
Hey, Buggie!
Don't you want to celebrate with the others?
There are interesting trophies there!
I've never stolen anything!
I don't know anything about it!
What are you talking about?
Well, nothing...
You say you're going to leave this ship one day, right?
What are you going to do next?
I'm going to get my own ship,
get a team of reliable satellites
and travel around the world in a hurry.
As a pirate, of course!
You're still so naive!
What did you say?
I admire your martial arts!
If you weren't so naive,
I'd be glad to consider you one of my supporters!
I'm one of your supporters?
Are you kidding me?
We're so different!
We'd better go our own ways!
Like a pirate, of course!
Can you become a pirate?
But if we meet in the sea,
I'll kill you!
Pirates do that too!
I don't get it!
By the way,
you said something about trophies here!
Oh, it's a devil fruit!
A devil fruit?
There are rumors that these fruits
are reincarnation of the sea devil!
If you eat it,
you'll get the power of the devil,
but you won't be able to swim anymore!
Someone who eats it
should be an idiot!
If I can't swim,
I won't be able to get the treasure
from the bottom of the ocean!
I also heard that
you can buy such a fruit for 100 million bells!
What did you say?
I'm a pirate, Bagi!
I'll eat the devil fruit now!
I really admire young people
who never think about consequences!
Well, Bagi,
do you feel anything?
No, nothing.
So it was a lie!
After all, the devil fruit
was just a myth!
Hooray! Everything went smoothly!
They think that
what I ate in the morning was a lie!
I better hide from the ship
until they figure it out!
After I sell the devil fruit
and get the treasure on this map,
I'll be able to
buy my own pirate ball!
Hey, Bagi!
What are you doing here?
Don't scare me like that!
What's wrong with your face?
If you've lost your food,
you'd better tie it up!
Kok will tell you everything!
Oh, by the way, captain!
Chance!
Mine! Mine!
What kind of paper is this?
My map!
Hey, Bagi!
What?
I can't move!
Rumor has it that it's impossible
to swim, right?
Only this!
Hey, Bagi!
What are you doing?
You seem to be swimming well!
Bagi!
Save me!
I'm coming!
Bagi!
Oh, Takshan saved your life!
I didn't mean that at all!
Because of him, my plan was
postponed for 10 years!
I did it!
I'm going to take the treasure
of the Southern Ocean
with my ability to split!
So let someone
just try to bite
my treasures!
It doesn't matter who it is,
he won't live!
My treasures!
Hands off!
Oh, damn!
He noticed me!
It doesn't matter where you run!
I'll find you!
I'll cut you into pieces!
Eggs!
My eggs!
E-e-e-eggs!
I'm your enemy!
That's strange.
Why isn't Mr. Mayor coming back
for so long?
Something might happen to him!
It was so loud today,
I've never heard anything like that!
Okay, I'll go back to town
and check it out. Wait here.
I'll go too!
Don't be stupid!
They are pirates from the Bagi gang!
That's why we have to go together!
If we can't protect
our own mayor,
don't try to stop us!
We all want that!
Then do whatever you want!
Let's go, people!
Yeah!
The voice-over adaptation
of the anime-media.tv project
was voiced by Shachiburi...
Shachiburi, Shachiburi...
One Piece!
Luffy is a real pepper!
He's definitely a brother!
Hey!
Drop the treasure and run!
Or he'll come back to you!
For nothing!
Drop the treasure, you say?
Absolutely not!
Why should I drop my treasure?
Is this your treasure?
Of course!
I'm a thief who steals pirates!
And since I stole them from you,
of course all these treasures
are now mine!
Oh, I see!
That's not true!
These are my treasures!
Do you think they're yours
just because you stole them from us?
What kind of upbringing do you have?
A thief who steals
other thieves!
That's funny!
What?!
I won't go down to your level,
you pirates!
You'd better get ready, Nami!
Nami!
Barabara!
Festival!
Rubber Man,
if you think you can help your friend,
you'd better do it now!
Damn!
He split into smaller pieces!
What the?
Nami!
Nami!
Nami!
Give me back my treasure!
You can do it!
And now the best part!
Stop it!
You're the one who should stop it!
Give me back my treasure!
Let me go!
Let me go!
Let me go!
Actually, you should let me go!
Die!
Didn't I tell you
that I'm your enemy?
Let's go!
This is like a Medicare gift!
Thank you for saving my life!
No problem, Chica!
Oh, yes! The map! It's mine!
That's not all, rubber man!
Eh? Is he still alive?
Shut up! How dare you hurt me so much?
I won't forgive you for this!
Let's get together!
Bara-bara-parts!
Huh?
Are you looking for my parts?
No doubt, you're a thief!
Hey, buggy!
Gomu-gomu!
I'm a dead man!
Bazooka!
I won!
Hey, they beat the buggy captain!
And what do we do now?
Let's pretend to be better.
That's a good idea!
Your straw hat is pierced with knives!
Come on, I can still wear it!
I'm not angry anymore, since the buggy was beaten!
Don't worry!
I'll help you fix it later!
Huh? What?
Nothing!
Whatever it is, I divided it in half!
You can carry it, but it's heavy!
You'll never change, will you?
The buggy chose a very good treasure for you!
Everything is of the best quality here!
All this will probably pull 10 million bells!
Here, take it!
Huh?
The Grand Line card!
You wanted it, didn't you?
You gave it to me!
You saved my life!
Oh, thank you, Nami!
Finally, I have a Grand Line card!
Super!
Does that mean you're with Nami?
I didn't tell you that I'm not going to the Grand Line!
I'm not going to the Grand Line!
I'm not going to the Grand Line!
I'm going to the Grand Line!
I didn't tell you that I'm not going to become a pirate!
Oh, come on!
If I'm with you, I can get more money!
However, I only work with you!
Remember that!
Yes!
Hey, Zora, wake up!
Zora, wake up!
What? The fight is over?
Yeah, I got the card and the navigator!
Huh? Huh?
Oh, girl, I'm going to fall into the ravine!
I can't move!
Of course!
If you could move, I would say that you're inhuman!
And what does this have to do with it?
You're the least like a human here!
In any case, we have to see what's up with the mayor!
Oh yeah!
We have to bring him to his senses!
Hey, you there!
You're not locals, are you?
Yeah, and you?
We're the residents of this city!
What happened to the pirates?
If you know anything, please tell us!
Oh, so you're the townspeople!
And I thought the enemies had run over again!
Oh, Mr. Mayor!
What happened?
Wake up!
Hey, Mr. Mayor!
He's unconscious!
Why do they allow such disgusting things?
I'm sorry, I kicked him!
What?
Hey, you shouldn't say that!
You saw it!
You saw it!
Yes, I saw it, but you did it out of good intentions!
Why did you harm our mayor?
I'm sorry!
Who are you?
Are you connected to those pirates?
Such terrible intonations!
If we don't be careful and don't say the word thief or pirate...
We're pirates!
We thought so!
Fool!
But it's true!
Pirates!
How dare you destroy our city like that?
We won't spare you, even if you're just children!
So what now?
They won't listen anymore!
Run!
Don't let him go!
How dare they hurt our mayor?
Why do you always say you didn't think it through?
It's a good city!
For the sake of your mayor, they're all ready to fight!
And no matter how many apologies we make, they won't stop being angry!
Hey, turn around!
Wait!
You couldn't have said that a few seconds earlier!
They turned around!
Shushu!
Dog!
Hey, free the way, Shushu!
Hey!
They're bad pirates!
You shouldn't have sent us!
Why are you delaying us?
Shushu, let us through!
Shushu!
Thank you, doggy!
Thank God!
Thanks to Shushu, we got away somehow!
Why did we get into this situation?
Well, it didn't go so bad.
Everything ended the way we wanted it to.
Well, I guess so.
Hey, is that your ship?
It's great!
Not really, I don't think so.
I took it from a bunch of stupid pirates.
How dare you say that!
Hey, Shushu!
Shushu!
Shushu!
Shushu!
Shushu!
Hey, free the way, doggy!
Shushu!
Shushu!
Shushu!
Shushu!
Hey, free the way, doggy!
Shushu!
Shushu!
Shushu!
Hey, free the way, doggy!
Shushu!
Shushu, we got away somehow.
Why did we get into this situation?
It's great!
Youuda!
Shushu!
Shushu!
Shushu!
Shushu!
Mr. Mayor, you have come!
Thank God, everything is fine with you.
What happened here?
This is...
When we appeared, it was already like that.
All the station of the pirates disappeared without a trace.
What?
What happened here?
What happened here?
What happened here?
What happened here?
Did you see anything?
Where are the kids?
The kids?
Are you talking about those three?
Are they still alive?
Oh, you idiot!
Enough of your foolishness to do such a terrible thing to an old man!
We chased the other three bastards.
But it didn't really calm us down.
I think they laughed at us.
Do they understand what we feel when our city is so badly damaged?
It's true, it's true.
I think we should go after them and...
Shut up!
The only one who has the right to scold them is me.
I'm not asking anyone who will be bad about them.
What?
Why are you defending these pirates?
They think they can just go like this?
Where did they go?
Oh, there's pepper in the side.
Pepper!
They saw themselves as if it was their own city.
I want to tell you so much more!
Okay, let's go!
Your ship is also under the flag of the goddess.
Because it was his ship.
I'll change it later.
Hey, wait!
Kids!
It's me!
I always thought it would be easy to grow up.
I thought that in critical moments death wouldn't matter to me.
I'm sorry, I'll be able to thank you someday.
Don't worry about it, relax.
Damn kids!
Damn kids!
Damn kids!
I have nothing more to say.
What did you say?
Did you leave a bag of treasures there?
There's already one bag worth five million Beli.
But they'll have to restore the city.
They need money.
But it was my treasure.
Can you imagine how hard it was to steal it?
Why did you do that?
I can't swim without it.
That's why I'm doing this.
I realized everything and now I'm sorry.
Who cares, you'll die.
What? Stop it, Ilya, really?
How dare you resist?
Now I'll really throw you into the sea.
So, to the best or worst.
So, to the best or worst.
That's how we got the Navigator now.
Great and mighty Usopp-san.
