If you need them, I'll give them to you.
Look for them! I left them all there.
In pursuit of their dreams, people went to the Grand Light.
Now enters the great era of pirates.

Who are the girls?
We are...
This time I will finish you!
Gomu Gomu Noa! Stopper!
Join us, Nami!
I will work with you guys!
For our two purposes!
Excellent! Fire!
Episode 7
Great duel!
You comrade Zoro, hang the acrobat Kabadji!
As I promised, I came to kick your ass!
Mugiwara!
Who did not understand, Mugiwara is a straw hat.
Only in Japanese.
You bastards!
You really had the nerve to turn here!
In front of the face of the enemy!
Listen, all I want is a card and a treasure.
Yes, I know.
You guys!
What are you doing here?
Do your own business!
This is my battle!
This is my city!
I will defend it!
Do not interfere!
Do not interfere!
Do not interfere!
Do not interfere!
What?
What?
What the hell are you doing?
Why did you do this to Mr. Mayor?
He was in my way.
Good idea.
If he fought, he would have been killed.
This will be better.
Do not fight!
You could have stopped him in another way.
I'm coming.
Big Nose!
This is what you should not have said.
You got me, asshole!
You dared to call me that?
Fire, buggy, bombay, immediately!
Did you hear that, asshole?
Hey, Luffy, run!
Let them be.
Disappear!
Nothing will come out.
Who?
Do not tell me that the buggy is a bomb!
He pushed her back.
We must warn.
The enemy is defeated.
What kind of creature are you?
Do not make people worry.
When you defeated the lion,
I realized that something was wrong with you.
People can not do this.
Please explain everything to me in detail.
About that ball that you just threw away.
What is it?
What is it?
Tell me everything in detail.
About that ball that you just used.
What was it?
Oh, it was a rubber inflatable ball.
I ask what the hell was it?
Are you some kind of monster?
How dare you do this to us?
Covered with his sixes, huh?
I can not eat anymore.
What happened here?
It's you!
Yo!
This is the guy in a straw hat.
Captain Buggy, be careful.
He also has the power of the devil's fruit.
He is a rubber man.
What?
A rubber man?
Yeah.
What is it?
A rubber man?
Yeah.
Devil's fruit.
So that's how he pushed back Buggy Bomb.
This is our greatest humiliation.
Captain.
Oh, Kabadji!
I can not hold my anger anymore.
Kabadji, you bastard!
What are you doing with Richie?
With this cat?
I wanted to stain his clothes and used it as a shield.
Richie!
Hey, Richie, hold on!
Are you okay?
Richie!
Dirty bastard!
Get out of the way!
You are dead!
Captain Buggy.
What is it, Kabadji?
Give it to me.
Okay.
Show them your acrobatics.
Head of the personal squad Kabadji Acrobat.
The anger of Captain Buggy has been transferred to me.
If you use the sword,
then I will be your opponent.
It looks fair, Zoro.
To fight you like a fictivist.
Hey, Zoro, can you stay out of it?
I'll take care of it.
Do not interfere.
I hurt you, Captain, right?
Idiot.
Acrobatics special!
Fire of the Elders!
What is it?
Not so strong.
Dirty receptionist!
He hit me earlier.
Acrobatics special!
Murderous smoke cloud!
What is acrobatics special?
It's just dust.
He did it again.
Something's wrong.
It's a pity for such a famous person like you.
So, did you realize?
It's stupid to oppose the Buggy gang.
How can he fight someone with such a wound?
I wonder how he's still alive.
What are you waiting for?
He's going to die now.
Zoro!
Zoro!
Get ready to die!
You annoying bastard!
Zoro, don't touch my wound!
It's so funny!
Damn!
Why didn't he dodge?
He's satisfied now.
I'll show you the difference between you and him.
Wow, cool!
This is Rarinozora.
I underestimated you.
My goal is to become the best fencing player in the world.
I'll make you a swordsman.
I can't lose in a battle.
Not even once.
I see.
You want to show me your strong will.
But don't worry.
You can't beat me only with this.
It's an excuse for your defeat.
It's quite a joke.
If I lose to someone like you
with such a wound,
I don't have to think about the future I'm counting on.
You!
Go!
Come on, Zoro!
Do whatever you want, guys.
You pirates can kill each other.
You win or you lose, it doesn't matter to me.
I'll go and find the treasure myself,
and then I'll go away.
Huh?
If fate will be favourable, we'll work together.
Bye!
Have a good fight!
Bye!
Thank you!
Now my best acrobatic special.
Acrobatic special!
Attack of hundreds of rotating wolves!
They're not normal.
Luffy and Zoro.
Nothing good will come out if you mess with them.
It's here.
I'm using this chance to get the treasure out of the map.
Acrobatic special!
Acrobatic special!
Climb the mountain!
Acrobatic special!
Enhancing irritation!
He jumps high!
Lonely flower vase!
Separation!
Kabadji!
I'll hold him!
Finish Zoro!
As you wish.
You bastard!
It hurts!
Luffy!
It's you!
Zoro's battle!
Stay out of it!
Sounded by Shachibori.
Sounded by Shachibori.
Wow, that's a lot!
And all of this is mine!
What are you doing with our treasures?
The devil!
He's awake!
He woke up!
Captain Bagi ordered that anyone who comes here...
Is it over?
It hurts!
What happened?
My chest suddenly hurt!
Your chest?
It hurts!
Here it is!
The map of the Grand Line!
I don't need your help, Captain, to deal with someone like you.
Enough!
I'm tired.
You finally got out of this battle.
I was surprised to see you still fighting with such a wound.
I said, what's wrong with your useless acrobatic specials?
Then I'll finish you off with one last blow.
With my real sword technique!
With my real sword technique!
Umri!
Oni-Giri!
Kako-chan!
Banda Bagi!
A pair of fairies have been defeated!
Not fairies!
Hirata!
Hey, Luffy, I'm going to sleep.
Yeah, I'll take care of you so you don't get in the way.
I was counting on such a treasure from this devil Bagi.
I even got tired of dragging it.
But after getting so much...
Anyway, I have to get out of this island as soon as possible.
So, you're pirates?
Yeah, we're going to the Grand Line.
Fool, this is not the place to just walk around.
Even if you enter the Grand Line, where do you think you'll go?
Just look around?
I'm going to become the king of pirates.
Don't be a fool, idiot!
Are you going to become the king of pirates?
I'm going to become the king of pirates.
The only one who becomes the king of pirates and gets all the treasures of the world is me.
Don't even dream about it.
You're talking too much.
Let's get started.
When I see your straw hat, it reminds me of one person.
And it pisses me off.
That pathetic red-haired bastard.
Red-haired? You said red-haired?
Do you know Shanks?
What?
What's wrong with you if I know him?
Where is he now?
Well, on the one hand, I seem to know where he is.
But on the other hand, I don't seem to know where he is.
What are you talking about?
Are you an idiot?
You're an idiot!
You're an idiot!
You're an idiot!
You're an idiot!
You're an idiot!
Probably, I could tell you what you'd like to know.
But I'm not such a good guy to do this.
Well, then I'll give you what you want.
You'll die faster than you open your mouth.
Rubber will not push knives.
Oh, really?
Bara-bara-bara!
If you jump, I can predict your movements.
Who said that?
Oh, I see. Interesting.
Similarly.
Gomu-Gomu-No!
Pistol!
Funny technique.
But your left hand is not protected.
And I'll cut it off.
Gomu-Gomu-No!
Too naive, rubber man.
Damn, he splits into pieces.
What kind of fight is this?
Like in a dream.
Hey, did you see that?
Rubber, do not show that you are conscious.
If we get involved in this,
our life will not be worth a penny.
Bara-bara-bara!
Relax.
How do you like it, puppy?
Rubber!
What is it?
You did not like that I cut your face?
You dared ...
You dared to damage this hat?
This is my treasure!
I do not ask anyone to damage my hat!
Yes, I promised.
To the one who gave me this hat.
That I will gather a team.
I thought he was not doing anything seriously.
But he got so angry because of this.
It seems that this hat has a story.
Exactly!
Is she so important?
If she is so important,
Defend her properly!
Chance!
Your hand!
Your hand!
I'll leave her to you.
She is very important to me.
Take care of her.
Someday ...
Give her back to me.
Like a great pirate.
This is a promise, Luffy.
How can a treasure be such a worn hat?
Treasures are gold and silver.
Shining and showing the coolness of the owners.
Is this a shitty hat a treasure?
Do not laugh at me!
This is the hat of Shanks!
What?
This hat belonged to Shanks?
It's not surprising that she looked familiar.
He always wore it with me.
You were on the same ship with Shanks?
Yes!
When I was a novice in pirates.
We were friends.
This is an unbearable bastard!
Shanks is a great man!
You were friends?
Do not compare yourself with him!
Are these gods?
Do not even say that you were friends with Shanks!
My balls!
This is my right to talk about Shanks!
What do I want?
Admit it!
What happened between you and Shanks?
Damn!
How dare you do this to my treasure?
Do you really want to know?
He is the only man
I will never forgive!
I will curse him until the end of my life!
I will never forgive him!
The End
The End
Get ready, buddy!
I will beat you!
Yes, I will beat him!
I will never forgive you for hurting Shanks!
Come on, Luffy!
I will beat him to protect my treasure!
Something is wrong?
It's the same thing!
Next time on One Piece!
Who will be the leader?
The power of the devil!
I will become the king of pirates!
The End
