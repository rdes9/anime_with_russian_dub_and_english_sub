If you need them, I'll give them to you.
Look for them. I left them all there.
In pursuit of their dreams, people went to the Grand Line.
They enter the great era of pirates.

I'm the girl we are!
Here you go, Dina. Give him this.
Sanji-san! Thank you!
Isn't this a wonderful restaurant?
Allow me to take it.
So, you came early.
What kind of secret technique is this, Amara?
This is a terrible taste!
Do what I say!
When I tell you to bring me some food,
you have to give it to me!
No one dares to obey me!
I'm the girl we are!
I'm the girl we are!
I'm the girl we are!
I'm the girl we are!
Here are enough food for 100 people.
Take it to your ship.
Zeph!
You said Zeph?
Episode 23.
Barati's Protector.
Great Pirate. Zeph's Red Legs.
What does this mean?
What do you think?
If his team recovers,
they will take over the restaurant!
If they only have enough powder...
Isn't that right?
The Lord couldn't get through the Grand Line!
Unbelievable!
Even the Great Pirates are here!
Unbelievable!
Even Don Craig couldn't get through!
Even the King of the Storms is here!
He couldn't get through 50 ships with his fleet!
The Grand Line!
You!
You are Zeph's Red Legs!
Are you still alive?
Captain Kok is one of the greatest pirates in history!
So what if I'm alive?
It doesn't concern you.
As you can see,
I spend my days like Kok.
Well said.
But if you look at it,
it wasn't your choice.
It was the only thing you had left.
I heard about Zeph's Red Legs.
He was a master of fighting
without using his hands.
His legs were so strong
that they could break rocks
or leave traces on metal.
He was famous for his Red Legs
because his shoes were made of red,
covering the blood of his enemies.
But it looks like you lost
your extremely valuable leg.
I heard about an incident
during your sailing.
Losing a leg meant you couldn't
participate in the battles anymore.
Why do I have to fight?
I don't need my foot for training
while I have a gun.
Just tell me what you were going to do.
Zeph's Red Legs!
I know you're the only one
who came back from the Grand Line alive.
You should have kept
the journal from that sailing.
Give it back!
Not bad, old man.
You've been to the Grand Line too?
Kind of.
I do have a journal.
But I'm not going to give it to you.
It belongs not only to me,
but to my entire team.
It will be too heavy
for someone like you.
Then I'll take it from you.
It's true that he couldn't
get through the Grand Line.
But look, I'm Don Craig,
the best.
I was strong enough
to do this.
I have enough people,
enough ambitions.
The only thing I need
is this information.
This is the only reason
why I was defeated.
I have to have this journal
and gather a new pirate fleet
to get the One Piece.
Then I'll become the pirate king!
Listen, my friend!
I'm the one who will become
the pirate king!
That's an officer!
Hey, get out of here, officer!
You're not his enemy!
I can't.
So stay out of it.
What did you say, boy?
I'll pretend
that I didn't hear anything.
No, you shouldn't.
You're not his enemy.
I'll pretend
that I didn't hear anything.
No, you shouldn't.
I just told the truth.
It's not a toy.
Of course.
I'll be the one
who gets through the Grand Line.
It's not a joke, woman!
Maybe it's just
a lack of information,
but even a fleet of ten ships
would be destroyed in seven days.
What makes you think
that you can do this?
Seven days?
That's enough for seven days!
What happened to them?
I'm sorry, but I hate
that kind of humor the most.
If you insist,
I'll kill you right now.
If you think
that's enough for you...
What?
Very well.
You're in a hurry
to go after him.
The Warlock
The warlock begins, Luffy.
Do you need some help?
We can't stay out of it,
as you can see.
Zoro, Usopp,
we're here!
It's all right.
Just sit and watch.
Oh, okay.
Then it's too bad.
And if you don't need us,
I'll help you,
if you need it.
Good luck.
What are you doing, Zoro?
Shut up and stay calm.
Are they your friends?
Are they all you have?
What are you talking about?
There are two more!
Hey, why are you still
taking me into account?
I'll deal with you later.
I have to feed my people now.
For those who don't want to die,
you'd better disappear
before I come back.
All I need is this journal
and this ship.
However, if you really
want to lose your lives,
I'll break my promise,
but I'll gladly send you
to the bottom of this ocean.
Remember that.
It's pretty quiet now.
Zoro's friends went to check
what was going on.
Do you think something happened?
Do you really think
everything will be okay?
How can I know?
Hey, Nami, Aniki,
maybe we should go check too?
Aniki!
Nami, Aniki!
What's going on?
Did something happen?
I'm sorry, Sanji-san.
I couldn't have thought
that everything would turn out like this.
Dubin, we don't need
an apology from someone like you.
We're just cooks
in this restaurant.
We'll feed anyone who comes in.
Owner!
Why did you do this to Sanji?
What's going on?
Really?
Is it all his fault?
He was going to destroy
your favorite restaurant.
Shut up, damn it!
You know what death is
from hunger?
Can you imagine
how awful it is
not to have food and water
in the boundless ocean?
What do you mean, owner?
The difference between you and Sanji
is that he doesn't know.
What do you mean?
What does Sanji know?
Why are you just standing
and brushing your teeth?
Get out of here!
I'll stay here
and fight.
I can't just let them
step over me.
Me too. I work here.
I have nowhere to go.
What are you doing?
Haven't you seen
how strong our captain is?
Hey, Gin.
The task of a cook is to feed the hungry.
However...
Now that your captain has eaten,
he's no more than a robber.
So that I don't do
anything for your friends,
don't cause me any trouble.
I'll kill anyone who dares
to touch this restaurant, even you.
Got it?
You saved his life
just to kill him.
You're so caring, Sanji.
Shut up!
Didn't I tell you
he's special?
Who cares?
You'd better get out of here.
Calm down.
Even if he's Craig,
he's totally broken.
Gin, you said
you didn't know anything about Grand Line,
didn't you?
It's true
that I don't know
what happened
at Grand Line
on the seventh day.
Was it a dream?
Or reality?
It's still
fresh in my memory.
It was incredible.
Just one person.
Just one person.
He destroyed an entire fleet
of 50 ships.
What?
It all happened
so unexpectedly.
He appeared
from nowhere
and started
to melt our ships
one by one.
And if the storm
hadn't started,
our main ship
would have been destroyed
too.
I can't imagine
how many ships
are still intact.
But it was
too horrible for me.
I don't even want to think
about what happened.
That man,
he pierces you
with his eyes,
like the eyes of a falcon.
What?
He pierces you
with his eyes,
like the eyes of a falcon.
What?
What did you say?
That man
must have
pierced you
with his eyes,
like the eyes of a falcon.
The fact that you remembered
his eyes
makes me believe
that it was him.
What can he do?
The man with the eyes of a falcon?
Do you know him, Zora?
This is the one I'm looking for.
I went
across the ocean to find him.
Maybe he was calling
you to split up with you?
I don't know anything about it.
Maybe you disturbed his dream.
Don't talk nonsense!
What the hell did he
do to destroy our fleet?
Don't be so nervous.
I'm just making assumptions.
Things like this
happen at the Grand Line.
What kind of place is this?
A place where anything can happen.
Luffy, stop it!
We can't go there!
What?
I'm so excited!
I hope the Grand Line
is really like this.
Couldn't you be more concerned
about your safety?
If that's the case,
the Grand Line will become my goal.
This man...
I'll definitely meet him there.
Are you fools?
You should be in a hurry
to die.
But it's none of your business.
When I decided
to become the best
fictivist in the world,
I gave up on a peaceful life.
And I'm the only one
who can call myself a fool.
Me too, me too!
Like a brave man in the sea,
me too!
Stop talking nonsense!
Fools!
Hey, hey!
Can you imagine
what's going on here?
Don Craig's ship
is right in front of the restaurant.
Talk as much as you can
after we get out of this mess.
We're alive!
It looks like a dream!
The nightmare is finally over!
We're back from the pirate's grave
alive and well!
That's true.
Now that we've recovered,
we can go back to the Grand Line.
What are you looking at?
What's with that face?
We're going back there!
Anyone else against it?
First of all, we'll get rid
of this broken ship.
Then we'll attack the restaurant.
Our enemies will be
swarms of useless cocks.
They won't pose any threat.
Attack!
They're coming! I can hear them!
We won't let them pass!
Because this ship
is our restaurant!
Run in horror, cooks!
What's going on?
What the hell?
Don Craig's ship
is cut in half!
Cut in half?
I said cut in half!
My huge ship!
It can't be!
It's impossible!
Raise the anchor!
Otherwise our ship will sink
along with it!
Yes, sir!
Bad!
Nami, Yosaku, and Johnny
are still on our ship!
Damn it!
Maybe we're too late!
We're too late!
We're too late!
We're too late!
We're too late!
We're too late!
Maybe we're too late!
Aniki!
Aniki!
Yosaku!
Johnny!
Are you okay?
Where's the ship?
What happened to Nami?
She...
I'm sorry, Aniki!
I'm leaving!
Nami, Aniki, and she...
If we're destined, we'll meet!
She took all the treasures!
What did you say?
It's him!
It's him!
Damn it, sir!
He was following us!
It can't be!
It's...
The man with the eyes of a falcon!
The man with the eyes of a falcon!
The man with the eyes of a falcon!

Hey, Zoro, what's wrong with you?
Is the world so far away?
This is the world's strongest!
Zoro!
Next time on One Piece!
Takanome no Miho-ku!
Kengo Zoro!
To the sea!
I will become the king of pirates!
