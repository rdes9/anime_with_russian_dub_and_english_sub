I'll give you praise!
Look!
I left them all there!
In pursuit of their dreams, people went to the Grand Line!
The great era of pirates is now entering!

It's the cannon core, isn't it?
Ah?
Ari, I missed!
What are you doing?
Learning to shoot from a cannon!
Super! You hit the target!
Super! You shot him down with one shot!
Of course! We're talking about aiming!
I know everything! Now you believe me!
From this moment on, you're a cannonier!
Come out, pirates!
That voice...
What's going on? What's going on?
Who are you?
How dare you, unknown pirates, try to kill my partner?
I don't know what's going on, but don't destroy our ship!
He...
He...
He's stronger than me?
Episode 20. The famous cook, Sanji from the floating restaurant.
Hey, where are we going today?
The best restaurant in the world.
You don't want to say he's in the middle of the ocean, do you?
To your beauty.
Well, just enjoy it.
Hey, aren't you Johnny?
Zoro's brother!
You're on the pirate ship, brother!
Why?
What's going on?
Isn't Yosaku with you?
What? You two know each other?
What's going on?
Yosaku!
Is he sick?
Yosaku!
Everything was fine with him until some time ago.
He started to get pale and lose consciousness.
I can't think of a reason why.
That's it!
That's it!
That's it!
Why?
And then he started to lose his teeth.
His old wounds have opened.
I just can't imagine what to do next.
I brought him to this rocky island to let him rest, but...
Then your ship attacked us.
I'm sorry.
If all problems could be solved with apologies,
we wouldn't need your help.
Isn't that right, partner?
Aniki, is he going to die?
Are you stupid?
What?
What are you doing?
What are you doing to my friend?
I'll kill you!
Luffy, Usopp,
we have some lemons in the pond, right?
Do you hear me?
Bring them to me, quick!
Yes, from the road!
Get out of my way!
No, you get out of my way!
He's got Zynga.
Zynga!
We'll get him up on his feet.
He'll get better in a few days.
Are you sure, Ani-san?
I'm so grateful to you!
Stop spitting on me, please!
It used to be an incurable disease,
but now it's gone.
It's gone!
It's gone!
It's gone!
It's gone!
It's gone!
It used to be an incurable disease,
which caused by the sailors.
Come on, drink it!
Come on, come on, come on.
But now it's just a slight problem
because of the lack of vitamin C.
In the old days,
ships couldn't take enough fresh fruits
to avoid it.
Come on, drink it!
Now he should be fine.
You're so good at it!
Just like a doctor!
I always said that you're a smart girl.
Yeah, that's true.
At least you should know
how it was!
It can happen to you at any moment, you know?
It worked!
He's alive!
Congratulations on your return, partner!
You can't recover so fast!
I'm sorry that we didn't introduce ourselves at once.
My name is Johnny.
And I'm Yosaku.
We're pirates hunters.
Zora Aniki was also one of us.
We're glad to meet you.
I was waiting to see you here, guys.
But I'm even more impressed.
Zora, the pirate hunter,
has become a pirate himself.
I'm glad to see you here, guys.
But I'm even more impressed.
Zora, the pirate hunter,
has become a pirate himself.
So, who's there?
I have no doubts!
Aniki!
Hey, partner!
This is the song, right?
Yeah!
This can happen in long-distance swimming.
Especially because we don't have enough space on the ship to store food.
Otherwise, we need someone who can understand dietology.
Dietology, you say?
I got it! We need Coke!
Let's go look for Coke!
I agree!
Then we'll have a lot of different delicious food.
Exactly!
If you're looking for Coke, I know where you need to go.
Yeah, that's the idea!
So, where is it?
It's pretty close to the Grand Line.
And somewhere close is the guy who's been looking for Aniki.
He's heading for...
North-North-East!
That's the place!
The destination is...
Barati!
A floating restaurant!
Oh, what an important fish! Isn't it amazing?
It really is!
Super!
What?
How did it get here?
A ship of sea-view!
What?
How did it get here?
A ship of sea-view!
It didn't come here just to attack us, did it?
It smells of trouble.
Just like from the sea.
I've never seen your pirate sign before.
Oh, no!
You know, we're not pirates!
Yes!
I'm a lieutenant of sea-view!
Full body iron fist!
Hey, who's your captain?
Show yourself!
It's me, Luffy!
It's me, Usopp!
Our pirate sign was created only yesterday!
I made it!
What's wrong with you?
I've seen these two before.
You think you're pirates, don't you?
What?
Looks like you're confused.
We...
It's too good.
Now let's go.
Of course.
I'll show you what we're worth as pirates!
Let's go!
Okay, let's go to the restaurant.
This ship is going to ruin the view.
Let's drown it.
Yes, sir!
He just ignored us.
We'll remind him.
What's this?
This is the search section with the awards for their heads.
Nami Anisan.
It means that if we kill them, we'll get money from these posters.
You think this is a profitable business, Anisan?
Oh, no!
He's aiming at us!
Give it to me!
Catapult!

Boss!
Are you okay, Chef Zeph?
Boss, are you okay?
What happened?
Are the places we ordered okay?
Chef Zeph, are you really okay?
I told you I was fine!
Come back to work now!
But, boss, your body...
You!
Don't get me out of here!
Our only duty is to feed our guests.
Are you trying to destroy our restaurant?
We caught him, boss.
Here's the culprit.
I'm so sorry!
Your leg!
Idiot!
I'm so sorry!
It didn't happen just now.
What?
Oh, it's not because of me, is it?
But I'm still wounded.
Medicines are expensive nowadays.
I don't bargain with you because of that.
But...
I have no money!
That's really sad.
If you have no money, then you have to work.
Okay, I can do that.
You have to work here for a year.
Yeah, I'll work here for a year.
Then I'll forgive you.
You said a year?
You mean a whole year under one year?
Something's wrong with Luffy.
How much longer do we have to wait?
It feels like we've been waiting for a month.
If he had just watched over him,
it wouldn't have happened.
He has too high an opinion about himself.
Look!
That guy isn't Lieutenant Fullbody by any chance.
He's Lieutenant Parseval.
Oh, he's so good to himself and noble.
You're amazing.
Everyone's looking at you.
That's not true.
They're all admiring your beauty.
Tasty!
Tasty!
This smell...
This smell is from the northern city of Mitkeiwa.
It's a little sour and a little spicy.
This wine...
It's from Wissburg.
Am I right, officer?
I'm sorry, but you're wrong, sir.
Your soup is getting cold.
Please enjoy it while it's hot.
By the way, I'm the chef assistant, Sanji.
All the waiters ran away after yesterday's incident.
Don't laugh at him.
Just look at his face.
He's discouraged.
Is it because of the wine?
A little.
A little?
I'm not going to talk about Astra Umi today.
Hey, what's going on here?
I told the waiter to give me a special wine.
What?
One week, please.
What did you say?
Two weeks!
Hey, you ruined the restaurant and injured the chef.
And you think we're doing a two-week job?
Then we'll agree on three.
No, damn it!
Never!
I don't agree!
I waited ten years to become a pirate.
I can't afford to lose a year here.
Okay, I've made up my mind.
I'll work here for a week to make up for the wine before you.
And this is my final decision.
Are you really in such a hurry?
Then let me offer you an alternative option.
Instead of a year of service, you can give me your leg.
No!
How sad!
I'm sorry.
Waiter!
Hmm?
Didn't I tell you that I'm not an officer?
But you really have a good taste,
if you came to such a company.
What about this, Anisan?
Don't you want to get rid of this guy
and drink wine with me?
Hey!
Does this restaurant serve soup with insects to its customers?
Insects?
What kind of bug is this in my soup?
Now he will have no choice but to confess,
and I will be on the horse again.
I'm sorry, sir.
But I don't know either.
I'm not very good at dealing with insects.
That's what I'm talking about.
Don't you dare fool around with me!
If you just threw an insect out,
it would still be edible.
I spent three days and nights
to make this soup.
Do you have to speak in such an overbearing tone
with your visitors?
I'm a visitor!
Visitors, who pays you money?
Stop it, Full Body-san!
Shut up!
Full Body-san!
They can pay you money.
Fill your stomach.
What?
I said...
They can pay you money.
Fill your stomach!
No! No! No!
You still refuse?
You think I'll change my mind
if you keep being stubborn?
No!
I'm sorry.
Full Body-san!
Sanji!
Chef's assistant!
Is this a fight?
Don't spoil our food.
Connecting with a chef in the sea
is a good way to commit suicide.
Remember it well.

Dorothy surely has a good job!
I'm sure he's up to something.
I don't think he'll be of any use to us.
What's going on?
You guys are so mean!
Hey, did you find a cop who could be your friend?
Yeah, I did.
He's the only one.
