        <pre>And here are the results of the practical exam.
I can't believe he took the first place without saving points.
The villains chose their goals and chased them.
In the second half, when everyone slowed down, he used his magic to lure them and counterattack.
This guy is strong.
At the same time, we have a guy who scored zero points for villains.
Other examiners also fell for the villain Pregrada.
But for a long time there was no one who would throw him in the trash.
But he gets such serious damage from his attack,
as if he is a small child whose miracle has just appeared.
My Heroic Academy
My Heroic Academy
The Last Supper
At night, after I opened the letter,
he contacted me.
Oh, I have recognized him!
Oh, damn it, I really wanted to see him.
Congratulations on your entrance.
Thank you so much.
What would you know?
I did not say the school's headmaster that we knew each other.
I did not say that we were friends.
I did not say that you are the headmaster.
What would you know? I didn't tell the school management that we knew each other.
You're one of those who would consider such a greed, right?
That's why I wasn't one of the judges.
Thank you for your concern!
By the way, I was surprised when I found out that you were teaching in the U.A.
That's why you came here, right?
After all, your office is in the Roppongi quarter, in the Minato district of Tokyo.
Stop it!
I couldn't tell anyone before the school announced it.
I received an offer to work in the U.A. when I was looking for a successor.
I was looking for a successor for a long time.
I see.
He initially planned to choose one of the students.
Such a student that he was given an amazing miracle.
My body broke from one blow of a powerful miracle one by one.
I can't control it.
Well, I can't help you here.
It's like asking a person to suddenly do a trick from a growing tail.
He can barely move them.
Wait, did you know what would happen?
Well, you didn't have time to tell me.
But everything went well.
The power showed itself.
Now you can do everything or nothing.
But when you learn to control it, you can adjust it so that your body can withstand it.
Control?
The more you train the vessel, the easier it will be for you to control your power.
Like this, for example.
Wait, this is all-powerful!
It can't be! When did he appear there?
Run, young Midoriya!
The flame that I passed on to you is still weak.
But in the future, neither rain nor wind will be able to extinguish it.
And then my fire will slowly weaken and extinguish.
And my work on this will end.
Deep meaning!
Episode 5. What am I capable of now?
April.
Did you take the napkin?
Yeah.
And your handkerchief?
What do you mean your handkerchief?
I took it. I'm already late.
I have to go.
And your handkerchief?
What else?
You're very cool.
And so my life at the Heroic Academy began.
I'm going!
The acceptance rating of the new ones for the Heroic U.A. course is less than one to three hundred every year.
In addition to the four that were accepted by recommendation, thirty-six were accepted after the entrance exam.
These thirty-six newcomers were divided into two groups of eighteen.
Class one A, one B.
Class one A, one B.
Class one A, one B.
Class one A, one A.
Damn, this place is so huge.
Ah, here it is.
Wow, the door.
Is this for giants or what?
The elite is selected from the number of applicants for the exam.
I hope I'm not in the same class with such terrible people.
Don't put your feet on the deck.
What?
This is disrespectful to your comrades and the people who made it for you.
Oh, come on.
What school did you come from, scoundrel?
Two top applicants.
I visited a private So-Mei.
My name is Ido Tenya.
So-Mei!
So you're from the rich, right?
It looks like I'll have a good time when I take you out.
You'll take me out?
What the hell?
And you're seriously going to become a hero?
You are...
Ah, well...
Good morning.
I'm from the private school of So-Mei.
What's your name?
Actually, I heard.
My name is Midoriya.
Glad to meet you, Ido.
Midoriya, you realized that it wasn't just a practical exam.
I didn't guess.
I underestimated you.
I hate to admit this, but you're better than me.
I'm sorry, but I didn't guess anything.
Oh, these curly hair.
You're the one who doesn't stand out.
It's the same girl.
And her form is very good.
Of course you passed.
Your blow was just amazing.
No, but it's all thanks to the fact that you went to talk to him about me so that I...
I can't believe that two of our students entered the U.A.
Especially you, Midoriya.
This is a real miracle.
What dirty tricks did you use to get there?
The first student from the school who entered the U.A.
My plan for the future is already broken because of you.
I told you to go somewhere else.
Kachan...
Someone told me...
You can become a hero.
And I did it with my own strength.
So...
I won't back down.
How dare he challenge me?
There's definitely something wrong here.
I wonder, today is just the opening ceremony and a great time.
Are you worried?
Damn, so close.
Go somewhere else and play with your friends.
This is a hero course.
What the hell is this?
So, it took eight seconds for you to shut up.
And we don't have much time.
You kids are completely irrational.
A teacher?
Does that mean he's a professional hero too?
But I've never seen such invisible heroes.
I'm your class leader, Aizawa Shota.
Nice to meet you.
Class leader?
Unexpectedly, but...
I'm your class leader, Aizawa Shota.
That's aadle typical of a teacher.
Teacher, teach me an negative line in a U.A.
Depending on the class leader,
é˜… first day can beizzing.
Ao risk!
Open one-day department!
You don't want him!
Yeah!
Next year he's taking part in 45 days a USDA test!
If that's what you want,
you don't have the time for ituing heroes.
Huh?
She believes that the school has freedom of action.
The same applies to teaching teachers.
You, kids, were still in middle school, right?
You passed the regulations where it was forbidden for you to use magic.
The country is still using the average results of students without magic.
But this is irrational.
Apparently, the Ministry of Education is talking nonsense.
Bakuga, you passed the practical exams best of all, right?
How far did you throw the ball in middle school?
67 meters.
Then try it now, but with a miracle.
You can do whatever you want while you're in the circle.
Hurry up and lay down on the floor.
Well, then...
The best throw is due to an explosive wave.
Die!
Find out your current limit.
This is the most rational way to develop a hero.
705 meters? Seriously?
That's what it looks like. It looks very fun.
You can use magic as expected from a hero's course.
It looks fun, right?
You have three years to become a hero.
Are you going to have fun all this time?
All right.
Whoever becomes the last in all eight regulations will be considered hopeless and will be expelled from the course.
What?
And for you, then?
The boy will have a hard time from the very beginning.
The number from the course?
Damn, that's bad in all eight regulations.
I can use either one of them completely or in any way.
I still can't control it.
We are free to make decisions about our students.
Welcome to the Hero Course U.A.
A serious test on the first day of classes?
What am I going to do?
Sounded with the support of the Gym Club, the site of the VKontakte group viki.com slash gymfans.
And also subscribe to the Twitch channel, twitch.tv slash gym club.
Will the last place be counted for those who have taken classes?
But this is the first day at school.
How many classes are there?
I don't know.
Natural disasters, major events and crazy villains.
You can't predict where and when these disasters will occur.
Japan is full of injustice.
Heroes are the ones who prevent such situations.
If you dreamed that after classes you would go to a cafe with your friends, I'm sorry.
The next day, I went to a cafe with my friends.
I was in the middle of the night.
After classes, you will go to a cafe with your friends?
I'm sorry.
The next three years, U.A. will do everything to test you one by one.
Go beyond the limits.
Plus Ultra.
Overcome these tests.
It's too serious to be an old man.
But this is the best of the best.
There is no other choice but to overcome it.
I didn't even warm up.
So, the demonstration is over.
Now the real test will begin.
Normative 1, 50 meters.
Start.
Attention.
3.4 seconds.
At 50 meters, I can only run on the third gear.
And Datenya.
A miracle engine.
As you can see, he is very fast.
Well, here he is like a fish in the water.
I wonder how others will cope.
Asui Tsu.
5.58 seconds.
I will make my clothes and shoes lighter.
Uraraka Ochako.
Miracle weightlessness.
Attention.
She can nullify the earth's gravity of any object she touches.
But if she gets too tense, she can get sick.
5.49 seconds.
7.50 seconds.
But this is still faster than my average score in high school.
You are all not very inventive.
Start.
I will show you how to use your miracle.
Aoyama Yuga.
Miracle.
Puppet laser.
He can shoot with a laser from the butt.
Although the shooting duration is still small.
5.51 seconds.
When I shoot for longer than a second, my stomach starts to hurt.
What a miracle.
The assessment of the upper limit of your senses and potential for growth
will allow you to understand what you are capable of and what you are not.
Start.
Attention.
Your inventiveness will also be taken into account.
Turbo-explosive acceleration.
4.13 seconds.
Bakugokatsuki.
Miracle-explosive acceleration.
7.02 seconds.
When I use both hands, the force is scattered.
So.
There are 7 more rules.
I'm sure the others will use the miracle to show the best results.
On the other hand, I have this power that will break my bones when I use it.
To control.
To control.
Even if I imagine it when I use the miracle.
And the secret to controlling the miracle is ...
Feelings.
Yes, as expected from the Almighty.
You've already given your all.
It almost killed me.
Well, now it will be easier for you.
You should have felt this feeling.
What does it look like?
Well, it was like ...
Like that.
Exactly.
Like an egg that was warmed up in a microwave.
Banal, but unique.
If you imagine it like that.
Then reduce the power.
Or reduce the time of preparation.
Such a comparison is suitable.
Imagine that the egg did not explode.
Imagine?
You have three weeks before the beginning of the class.
Continue to focus on this image.
Nothing will happen in one day.
But I am sure that one day you will be able to.
Normative 2.
Imagine an egg that does not explode.
What?
540 kilograms?
Are you a gorilla?
Or an octopus?
Octopus is just sexy.
Normative 3.
Jump from place to length.
Control.
Normative 4.
Side jumps for endurance.
Normative 5.
Swing the sword.
Endless?
Wow!
She got endless!
This is bad.
This test will not be so easy for me.
Everyone showed themselves at least in one of the normatives.
Everything that remains is running at a long distance,
exercise for the press and stretching.
So now or never.
With such success, I will be the last.
Don't give it to him if he continues like that.
What?
Of course!
After all, he is a trifle without abilities.
You know.
Abilities?
Don't you know what he did at the entrance?
What?
The time has come, yes?
Izuku.
You are very cool.
You can become a hero.
I will definitely become...
46 meters.
I tried to take advantage of her now.
I erased your magic.
This entrance exam was irrational.
Even a guy like you was accepted.
You erased my magic?
These glasses?
Exactly!
You can erase the magic of others
by just looking at them.
Eraser hero.
Wipe your head.
Wipe your head?
I don't know such a thing.
I heard about him.
He works secretly.
He doesn't like public fame.
He says it bothers him.
That's right, young Midoriya.
We don't get along very well with him.
Judging by what I've seen,
you can't control your magic.
Are you planning to become useless again
and hope that you will be saved?
It's not what I want!
Regardless of your intentions,
I'm only talking about
what you have to do to others.
In the past,
there was one charming hero
who saved more than a thousand people
and became a legend.
Let you be so reckless.
You will become a useless doll
after saving one person.
Midoriya Izuku.
With your power,
you will not become a hero.
I returned your miracle.
You have two attempts to throw.
Hurry up and finish it.
It seems that he was given some kind of advice.
They probably tell him
that he is excluded.
I'm not worried at all.
Who are you?
What should I do? What should I choose?
Will he prepare for an honorary defeat
using all his strength?
Or will he be scared
and take the last place?
It doesn't matter what he chooses.
He has no potential.
I still can't control my power.
Should I put all my strength
into one throw?
Even the Almighty said
that nothing will change overnight.
If this is my only choice,
then I need to give it my all.
Zero potential.
As the teacher Izawa said,
with such success,
I will never become a hero.
Hey!
Are you serious?
I need to try much more than others.
That's why
with all my strength,
I will do everything
that I can right now.
Destroyer!
It doesn't hurt anymore.
As before.
Do you want to become useless
and hope that you will be saved?
Teacher!
I can still
move.
This kid...
I came because
I was worried.
What the hell, kid?
You can still control
your strength,
but you can't become helpless.
That's why you pushed the ball
to the last moment,
pointing all your strength
to the tip of your finger,
reducing the damage
when you increase your strength.
What would happen to me, kid?
You are so cool!
The continuation follows.
