The hero will always find a way out of a difficult situation.
Hey, villain, have you ever heard these words?
Out of bounds!
Plus Ultra!
I have really weakened.
In better times, five hits would be enough.
Now I need more than 300.
And now I have no time left.
Now, villain, I think we all want to finish quickly.
Weakened?
No matter how much we underestimated him.
I can't believe he did this to my NOMO.
Did he really cheat?
My Heroic Academy
NOMO
Hands up!
Hands up!
And I don't have any wits here.
Use them and the boy is done.
Kaminari, here's an ambush.
We were too relaxed.
He attacked when we decided to take them all out.
I can't believe we were so careless.
I don't want to kill someone with an electric wonder like mine.
But it seems to have to.
An electric wonder?
I'm sure he was talking about a broken connection.
I'll come to you.
Don't move.
You're lucky to have an electric wonder with Kaminari.
What?
What do you mean?
Even if you don't become a hero, you won't be left without a job.
You have a big demand.
I'm just wondering why you decided to become a villain.
I see.
She can attack without moving.
If she can connect a wire.
It's okay if you don't want to answer.
Stop.
I thought I wouldn't notice.
Childish tricks will only work on some adult moron.
Heroic newcomers should not be exposed to the hostage of danger.
If the two of you don't resist, I'll let this idiot go.
Decide whether his life is yours or not.
And now don't move.
Episode 13.
In the heart of each of us.
What's going on here?
He doesn't look like a weak hero at all.
Did he really lie to me?
Something's wrong.
You don't attack.
You said you'd figure it out.
Come and try if you dare.
All-powerful.
As expected, it seems we won't have to interfere.
Midoriya, we need to get out of here immediately.
It'll only get worse if we're taken hostage.
No.
He's bluffing.
It's almost unnoticeable because of the cloud of dust.
But I can already see the smoke that usually comes out of him during the transformation.
All-powerful.
I can't move anymore.
This thing named Nomu was too strong.
If I take one more step, I won't be able to support my deception and return to my true form.
Just a little more.
No!
What are you waiting for?
Slow down.
If I can hold on a little longer...
How is Nomu not enough?
He could have fought him without any thoughts.
Shigaraki Tamura, please calm down.
Looking closely, I can see that he's been hurt by Nomu's attack.
Besides, his students are all over the place.
Besides, his students are all over the place.
And we still have some tools that can be used.
And I'm ready to argue that the help is already on the way.
If we combine our efforts, we still have a chance to kill him.
Yes, you're right.
That's right.
That's right.
We have no other choice.
We've come so far, and we won't kill the last boss.
I think the Almighty will deal with the main villain.
Let's go help the others.
Midoriya?
I'm the only one who knows.
The fog villain is probably more dangerous.
The Almighty must have gone beyond his capabilities.
If the fog villain fights him, I'm sure...
You're going to attack?
And this is your payback for what you did to Nomu?
Here's your mother.
Faster!
Faster, guys!
He's fast.
I'm the only one who knows where he is.
Midoriya?
Broken.
I used to be able to control it.
But I did it.
The hidden part of his body.
If you want to know where he is,
I'll tell you where he is.
I'll tell you where he is.
The hidden part of his body.
If I get into it, I'll be able to get rid of him from the battlefield.
Get away from the Almighty!
It's a hand.
He was behind him?
I won't buy it again.
Are they here already?
It's an attack.
Is it really?
I'm sorry, guys.
I'm sorry I'm late.
I brought everyone I could find.
Ida.
I'm Ida Tenya, class 1A senior.
I'm back.
Clear the way!
There are people defending the study talked to you guys!
The exists!
Darn.
They are here already.
Now game is over.
Let's go back home and try the black one again.
The one whose miracle can get any of them at such a distance is me, Shigaraki Tomura.
It's...
The 13th!
Let me fail today's mission, but next time I'll kill you, the symbol of the world, the Almighty!
The work of professionals is what they fight with.
The world of villains was an experience we weren't ready for.
I couldn't do anything.
That's not true.
If it weren't for those few seconds you won for me, I would have died.
You saved me again.
Almighty!
Almighty!
I'm so glad you're okay!
They got us in trouble, didn't they?
More importantly, we have to make sure all the students are safe.
If there are so many professional heroes gathered here, it means they didn't attack the whole academy.
Midoriya!
Kirishima!
Are you okay?
Young Kirishima, I admire your excitement about a friend.
Wait, he's gonna see us!
Damn it, stop him!
Kirishima, wait!
We want to make sure all the students are safe, so please gather at the gate, and we'll take care of the wounded.
That makes sense.
Got it!
Hey, we were told to gather at the gate!
Thank you for helping, Cementos.
I'm a fan of yours too.
Cementos! Cement is a miracle!
He controls the cement that he touches like clay.
He's very strong in the modern city jungle.
You need to go to the medical center, but don't show it to the others.
You're always so reckless, aren't you?
If I wasn't reckless, I would have been killed.
The enemy was so strong.
It hurts.
I got shot in both arms and both legs.
We're completely broken.
Even Nomu was defeated.
They took out all the subordinates in one moment.
And those snot.
The symbol of the world was healthy.
You made a big mistake, Cementos.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
You made a big mistake, Sensei.
Not at all.
We just didn't prepare properly.
Yes, we underestimated them.
It's good that we did it under such a typical name as the Aliens of the Villains.
By the way, what about my precious creature Nomu?
Didn't he retreat?
He was sent on a flight.
What?
If in detail, then without accurate coordinates of his location,
I can't find him even with my teleport.
I don't have time for that.
After all our efforts to make him equal to the Almighty,
well, you can't do anything about it.
What a disappointment.
Strength.
Exactly.
There was a guy who didn't give up on the speed of the Almighty.
Is that so?
If he didn't interfere,
then we could have killed the Almighty.
This bastard.
Bastard!
Stop reading.
Our efforts were not in vain.
Gather elite villains.
Get ready as much as you need.
We can't move freely,
so we need a symbol like you.
Shigaraki Tomura.
Next time, show the world what you should be afraid of.
16, 17, 18, 19.
Except for the guy with injured legs,
all the others are harmless.
Ojiro, I heard that you really burned out today.
Did you cope with everyone alone?
I thought that everyone was on their own.
I survived thanks to the tactics of running and hitting.
Where were you, Hagakure?
In the crawl zone.
Todoroki was unrealistically strong.
I was very surprised.
I'm glad you didn't get hurt.
I almost froze her.
It was close.
Where? Ask me, was it me?
Where do you think it was?
I see.
So the weak villains fought with you.
They underestimated us because we are children.
Where?
So it was the Almighty who made the hole in the roof.
What a great power.
Yes, the Almighty.
Where do you think I was?
So where?
It's a secret.
Let's bring the students back to their classes.
We're not going to interrogate them anyway.
Detective, how is the teacher Aizawa?
Multiple fractures in both hands.
The bones of the face were also seriously injured.
Thank God the brain was not seriously injured.
But his eyes are shattered.
And this may affect his vision.
That's what I was told.
How so?
What about the Thirteenth?
They are already engaged.
Serious fractures in the muscles of the back and arms.
But the Thirteenth will survive.
The same with the Almighty.
The power of the healing girl is enough to put him on his feet.
He is now in the medical department.
Adeko!
What about Midori?
Midori?
Ah, he was also brought to the medical department.
Thank God.
And now go back to your class.
Yes.
Sansa, I also need to look into the medical department.
Follow everyone here.
Yes.
Is that a cat?
Not a dog?
Damn.
Bakuga!
He told you to go back to class.
I know, I'm an idiot.
It would not prevent significant changes in our security system.
Yes.
Teleportation miracles are quite rare.
And the worst thing is what is in the hands of villains.
Detective Tsukauchi!
We have received information that someone who looks like a villain
was caught in a crawl on the territory of the academy.
State?
There are no visible damage.
There is no resistance.
He does not even answer when he is called.
Director!
We would like to examine every corner of the school.
Of course.
Let some complain, but you have more authority for this.
You are strong in investigations.
I count on you.
Groups, start examining the school.
Given the situation, I can not count on you.
Maybe I'm wrong, but it seems to me that I again reduced my limit of being in a heroic form.
I hope I have at least an hour left.
All-powerful.
But there is nothing to do with this.
Whatever happens.
Excuse me.
All-powerful, long time no see.
Tsukauchi, are you here?
All-powerful, it's okay that you are in this form.
Yes, everything is fine.
Why?
Because Naoma Tsukauchi is my best friend among the police.
What else is the presentation?
Sorry to interrupt, but All-powerful, could you tell me more about the villain?
Please wait.
More importantly, are the students all right?
What about Saezawa Isotri, the head of the 13th?
Except for the guy, the rest have mild injuries.
And both teachers are in stable condition.
I see.
If the three of them did not risk their lives, the students would not have survived.
You are mistaken, Tsukauchi.
The students also fought and risked their lives.
All-powerful.
Were there any first-year students who got combat experience so early, survived and learned the fear of the world of adults?
The villains have done a great stupidity.
This class is strong.
They will become strong heroes.
I am absolutely sure of that.
The end.
The End
The End
The End
Well, thank you very much.
Stay healthy, be careful on the way home.
Yes, sir.
And so the alliance of villains at USJ was only the beginning of a serious incident that will happen in the future.
Deco!
But then I had no idea about it.
See you next season.
I'm going to get it!
The second season of TV anime is coming.
