My Heroic Academy
The rain doesn't stop
In this world that's not mine
It's not strange at all
My feet are caught in the mud
I'm not blaming you
I'm alone in the dark
Where am I?
Am I ashamed of the words I've drawn?
Let's entangle, make you, make you
But still, I'm going
The sound of the beginning
of the people I've cut off
Even if I'm going, I'm not afraid of the heat
I can go back one step at a time
Even if I'm going, I'm not afraid of the heat
Who's that?
It's like an entrance exam.
Has the class already started?
Don't move.
It's the villain.
13th and tear your head off, right?
In the schedule of the teachers that we got on the days,
it's said that the Almighty should also be here.
So, is it a matter of the hands of those bastards
who broke into the territory?
Where is he?
I've spent so much effort to get everyone together.
The Almighty.
The symbol of the world.
I wonder if he'll show up if we start killing the kids.
What are the heroes of the profs fighting against?
And what are they facing?
Incredible evil.
Episode 10. The battle with the unknown.
The world is in danger.
Episode 10. The battle with the unknown.
What? The villains?
It can't be.
How did they even get into the territory of the Heroic Academy?
Teacher, what about the security sensors?
We have them, of course, but...
Did they only appear here or throughout the school?
In any case, the transmitters did not work.
So they have someone with a miracle capable of bypassing them.
An isolated place outside the Academy.
Just when the schedule of the class.
Maybe they...
And this ambush was clearly planned with a certain purpose.
Episode 13. The evacuation begins.
These villains have found a way to bypass the security system.
There is one among them with an electromagnetic miracle that violates communication.
Kaminariya, contact the Academy with the help of a miracle.
Yes, sir.
And what about you, teacher?
Are you really going to fight alone?
Although you can erase miracles, but there are too many of them.
Battle style, wipe your head.
Capture after wiping the enemy's magic.
And in this battle...
You can't be a hero with only one technique.
I rely on you, Thirteenth.
Artillery squad, forward!
Intelligence said that there should only be the Thirteenth All-Powerful.
And who is this?
I don't know.
But if he thinks he can win, attacking us alone, then he is a complete moron.
What?
My miracle.
The bullets don't fly out.
Idiot, this is the same wipe your head.
He wipes the miracle with one look.
Wipe?
Wipe?
Can you erase such a mutation of the body as I do?
No, I can't.
But the abilities of bastards like you are statistically better only in close combat, where you have the advantage.
That's why I took measures against them.
He is also strong in close combat.
And since he hides his eyes behind the glasses, it is impossible to guess whose miracle he erased.
I don't know.
Therefore, even acting in the group becomes more difficult.
I see.
I hate professional heroes.
The crowd of weaklings cannot stand up against them.
Cool!
And the teacher Izawa is really cool, fighting against many enemies.
There is no time for analysis.
Run to the shelter.
I won't let you go.
Damn!
Only once and the most dangerous among them managed to escape.
I'm glad to meet you.
We are the Alliance of Villains.
It may be insolent on our part, but we invited ourselves to the House of Heroes, the UA Academy.
With one goal, so that the All-Powerful, the symbol of the world, would let go of his last breath.
What?
I thought that the All-Powerful should have been here.
Were there any changes made?
Well, we'll talk about that later.
And now I will play my part in all this.
Didn't it occur to you that we are going to get you when you come here?
God, it was dangerous.
You are right.
Even though you are still learning,
in the future, you will not be able to do it.
You will not be able to do it.
You will not be able to do it.
You will not be able to do it.
You will not be able to do it.
You will not be able to do it.
Even though you are still learning,
in the future, you will not be able to do it.
You two, get out of there!
My task is to separate you and torture you to death!
What?
What?
Guys!
Run!
Teleportation?
Is that his trick?
They want to kill the All-Powerful?
What the hell is going on here?
Why?
And here he is.
Sorry, I have nothing against you,
but it's time to say goodbye.
Midoriya!
Goodbye.
Shipwreck Zone
How are you, frog?
You have a big chest.
What?
Thank you, Asui.
Just call me Tsu.
Asui Tsu-yu!
A miracle of frog form!
He can do everything that frogs do.
That's logical.
The situation has gotten much worse, though.
Yeah.
Remember what that villain said?
The All-Powerful was supposed to be here.
Did they make any changes?
They knew the U.A. schedule.
If you look at the general picture,
it's probably because of them
that the media broke through to the Academy territory.
Doroki once said,
you were waiting for the right moment.
But, but!
They can't beat the All-Powerful!
As soon as he comes,
he'll beat everyone on the left.
Mineta.
What?
You didn't think they'd come so far
because they found a way to kill him?
These villains are strong
and they said they'd torture us to death, you know.
We'd just have to stay alive
until the All-Powerful comes.
And even if he comes,
there's no guarantee that everyone will survive the end of the battle.
Midoriya!
What kind of horror is she talking about?
What?
You bastard!
I'll kill you!
They surrounded us!
These villains have a way to beat the All-Powerful.
I have a feeling that she's right.
Otherwise, they wouldn't be here.
But why do they want to kill him?
Because he's a threat to all villains and evil in general?
Or is it all because he became a symbol of the world?
No.
I know.
You can become a hero.
I like it.
Now...
Opinion.
Let's go, young Midoriya.
Congratulations on the ranking.
Opinion.
Now everything's fine.
Why?
Because I'm here.
I don't care.
Why?
If these bastards...
...have found a way to beat the All-Powerful,
then right now...
...we have to stop them from fulfilling their plan.
The one who fought and won.
Climbing Zone.
Why do you have to lose to one student?
Behave yourself.
You're an adult, aren't you?
Earthquake Zone.
Mountain Zone.
Fire Zone.
Hurricane Zone.
Earthquake Zone.
I can't get in touch with 13 or Aizawa, regardless of the reasons, I neglect my duties as a teacher
because of the unworkable time that has happened. I did very stupid things.
What if I say something at the end? I think the body will last about 10 minutes more.
I will!
Hold the horses.
Director?
Yeah, nobody knows if it's me or a dog or a bear, but one thing's for sure, I'm the director.
Your fur looks great, as always.
It's all about the keratin. People only have dreams like that.
But that's not the point now.
Look here! The Almighty figured it out with three incidents in an hour.
And it's all because of the hooligans that are getting in the way of ordinary people, despite your presence in the city.
But you shouldn't interfere every time you hear about an incident.
You're completely out of your mind.
Your heroism is now limited because of the wound and its consequences.
Besides, you need to teach the successor of the miracle one for all.
If you still want to be a symbol of the world, the only way to keep your secrets in secret is to come here.
That's why I offered you to become a teacher.
I think you can do it.
You can do it.
That's why I offered you to become a teacher.
I think you can stay and rest a little longer.
After all, you can do the next class only for a short time, right?
Although I offered you a position.
But since you accepted the offer, I would like you to spend more time teaching.
Besides, there are enough hero agents in the city.
Everything is as you say.
That's why I was going to go to the USJ.
Even if you go now, you still have to come back.
Considering this, you can stay and listen to my thoughts about teaching.
He pours tea!
Here, drink.
It may take a long time.
But I'm worried that they didn't answer me and the signal didn't pass at all.
First, considering the vulnerability and responsibility of the position of the hero mentor.
And you haven't changed a bit, director.
I'm sorry.
Shoji, how are the others there?
Can you check?
They are scattered throughout the territory, but within this building.
You can't take him by physical attacks.
This miracle is still a hemorrhoid.
Master.
Yes?
I entrust this task to you.
Run to the academy and tell them about what's going on here.
The sirens didn't work, and the communication tools don't work.
Our security system works on the infrared.
And even if three heads erase the miracle of all the villains, it still doesn't work.
This means that there is one among the villains with a miracle of communication interference,
who has been hiding since the very beginning of the battle.
You will get to school faster than we will find him.
But it will be a shame for the old man to leave everyone in danger.
Go to the emergency exit.
You can get out and the alarm will work.
That's why they fight only inside.
As soon as you get out, they won't chase you.
Is this fog your feet?
Use your magic to save others.
I fully support you.
As then in the canteen.
And I will.
Please, sir.
You don't even have a choice.
But to be so stupid and tell your plan in the presence of the enemy?
We did it because we don't care if they find out about it.
Black hole!
What does it mean to fight?
Are you out of your mind?
They got involved in the killing of the Almighty.
You're contradicting yourself, Midoriya.
It's better to sit quietly and wait for the arrival of the heroes from the UAE who will save us.
Mineta, these guys down there are counting on us to fight them in the water, right?
Didn't you hear me?
Does it mean that they knew everything about the park before they gathered people?
Exactly.
For the villains who collected information about everything so carefully, they behave strangely.
They sent you, Asu.
What?
That is, Tsu!
To the shipwreck zone!
Well, keep talking.
Okay.
What did you want to say?
I wanted to say...
I wanted to say that the villains probably don't know what kind of miracles we have.
True.
If they knew that I was a frog, then they would have thrown me into the fire zone.
That's why they divided us.
And they plan to defeat us by numbers.
We are smaller, we have no experience at all.
Our only chance is that the enemy does not know what kind of miracles we have.
The enemy is not trying to get on the boat, which confirms my theory.
But that also means that they take us seriously.
I'll tell you more about my magic.
I can jump high, climb walls.
My tongue stretches for 20 meters in length.
I can also inflate my stomach.
It is covered with poisonous slime, but not very poisonous.
And I can separate it.
Separate?
The last two skills are useless, so don't take them into account.
I figured it out, but you're pretty strong.
My ability is very strong, but after using it, I become useless.
It's like both sharp swords.
And this thing is very sticky.
Depending on my condition, in the best case, it will last a whole day.
A new one grows in a torn place.
But if you pull out too much, your head will start bleeding.
They don't stick to me, they just bounce off.
A few days later
That's why I told you that we need to sit still.
My magic doesn't suit the battle at all.
It's not like that.
It's an amazing magic.
We just need to think about how to use it.
I'm tired of waiting.
Let's finish them off as soon as possible.
The ship is destroyed.
Don't give up!
What are you doing?
The enemy will find out about your magic.
What the hell is that?
They are careful and don't touch them.
The vodka will sink in a minute.
As soon as they are in the water, the victory will be ours.
That's true.
What did you do to become a hero?
Shut up!
It's strange that you're not afraid at all now.
We were just schoolchildren not long ago.
Who would have thought that we would be killed almost immediately after we entered the academy.
I wish I could squeeze a rose on my chest before I die.
When the enemy is confident in their victory, then we will have a chance.
That's what the Almighty said on TV.
What?
This is the only way to win.
Oh, these kids.
With their whining and screaming.
Hey, Shigaraki.
We are ordered to be on guard, remember?
Don't judge them by age.
Watch their tricks,
as well as point out common sense.
With our tricks, we have an advantage in the water.
Act like Kachan.
Are you serious, Midoriya?
Die!
What a fool.
Even by hitting the surface, I can't hit everyone in the circle.
Even if we get out of the shipwreck zone, there are enemies in other sectors too.
I can't sacrifice my hand.
Imagine,
don't let the egg explode.
Mineta.
Despite the fact that he's trembling,
even though he's the same as me,
even though he's scared.
Why?
Why?
Delaver, the Destroyer.
Tsu, Mineta.
What the...
What the hell, Midoriya?
Why are you so cool?
Even I...
Even I can...
Hey!
It sucks me.
Is he the same guy?
And what's this?
I can't tear it off.
If you're in one point,
if you hit the water surface with all your might,
it will disperse.
And then it will pull back to the center.
Move!
Get out of the way!
Get out yourself!
All in one swing.
I think we've overcome the first obstacle.
You're both very cool.
To be continued.
To be continued.
To be continued.
To be continued.
