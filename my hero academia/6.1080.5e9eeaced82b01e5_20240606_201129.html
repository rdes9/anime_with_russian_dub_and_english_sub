        <pre>With all my strength, I'll do everything I can right now!
Destroyer!
It doesn't hurt like it used to.
He didn't just use the power of throw.
He didn't just use the power of throw.
He concentrated it on the tips of his fingers.
Teacher!
I can still move!
This boy...
My Heroic Academy!
I'm not attacking you.
I'm playing alone in the air.
Where are you?
Are you ashamed of what you've drawn?
We're entwined. Thank you, thank you.
Even so, it's not enough.
Where are you?
Are you afraid of what's in front of you?
Are you afraid of what's in front of you?
Aren't you afraid of what's in front of you?
Aren't you afraid of what's in front of you?
He threw it 700 meters away.
He finally showed his Heroic Result.
He's got a finger boot.
It was like that at the beginning.
He's got a strange charm.
Not enough style.
Where does that come from?
Everyone has a charm at the age of four.
It's incredible.
But in reality...
Someone told me...
You can become a hero!
And I did it with my own strength!
What does all this mean?
Hey, Deco!
You bastard!
Tell me what's going on!
What?
These bandages are so strong!
This is a weapon for capture
made of carbon fiber,
woven with metal wire
and special alloy.
Damn it!
Don't make me use my charm
over and over again.
My eyes are drying out.
What kind of a trick is this?
A great leader of Class 1A,
Aizawa Shota,
rinses the magic of those
who he will look at.
The effect is diluted when he blinks.
Let's not waste time.
Let the next one go.
Is your finger okay?
Yeah.
Until recently...
He was just dust on the road.
You're lucky, Chan.
Your charm is so cool.
I hope I'll get mine soon.
No matter what kind of a charm you have,
you won't beat me.
Dust...
on the road!
Episode 6.
Fiery Assault.
Then...
Then I suppressed the pain.
While we were following the other rules.
So, I'll quickly tell you
about the results.
The overall score is the sum
for all the rules.
It's a waste of time to talk about them,
so I'll show them to you.
The student with the lowest score
will be eliminated.
My only good result
is the throw of the ball.
I didn't do well in all the others
because of the pain.
And the last place is...
excluded?
By the way,
I lied about the exception.
It was a rational trick
to make you use the maximum
of your tricks.
What?
Of course it was a lie.
It's obvious if you think about it the right way.
I didn't notice.
Well, it made you worry a little.
I'm ready for the test at any time.
So, the lesson is over.
Your study plans are in the office.
When you come back,
take a look at them.
Midoriya,
go to the old lady's medical center.
Let her do it.
Tomorrow there will be much more
cruel tests.
Be ready.
I could have made it through
now,
but I didn't do well in many of them.
I'm starting from the last place.
I still have a lot to learn
to get closer
to my dream.
Aizawa,
you're a liar.
Oh, the Almighty,
so you've been watching.
A lot of free time,
I'll see.
You say it's a rational trick.
The first of April was last week.
Last year you excluded
a whole class of students.
You kicked them out
without thinking.
Who did you think was hopeless?
To take your words back
to someone like you,
you probably felt the potential,
didn't you?
Did I?
It looks like
you support him a little.
And that's how a teacher
should behave.
His potential
wasn't zero.
It's just that
I'm going to kick you out
without any prospects.
There's nothing more cruel
than breaking your dream
halfway.
So you're acting your own way,
Aizawa.
Still,
we're not doing very well.
I'm so tired.
Ida!
Give me your finger.
Yes, thank you, healing girl.
Wow, you're healed.
I'm so tired.
My charm
only accelerates the ability to regenerate.
Healing requires
your energy.
If you continue to receive serious damage,
you'll spend a lot more.
And eventually you'll die.
I need to stop hoping for others.
I need to hurry up
and learn how to control my power.
Aizawa taught me.
I even thought
it was the best of the best.
I didn't think
the teacher would encourage us to cheat.
I thought Ida was scary,
but he was serious about it.
Hey!
You two!
Are you going to the station? Wait!
Uraraka?
Oh, you're an endless girl.
I'm Uraraka Ochako.
And you're Ida Tenya.
And you're Deku Midoriya, right?
Deku?
No, but during the test
I heard the boy Bakug say
Deku, you bastard!
Right?
Well, my real name is Izuku,
and Deku calls me Kachan to laugh at me.
An insult?
Oh, here it is. Sorry.
But Deku sounds almost like
I can do it.
I like it.
Call me Deku.
Midoriya, you agreed right away?
Isn't that an insult?
It's like a paradigm shift to the copernicus.
Copernicus? With whom?
That's how my first day at the academy went.
I have to try my best.
But the almighty...
I can be happy
because I have friends.
It's time to relax, boy.
The real test will be tomorrow.
Well,
what's wrong with this offer?
A regular lesson.
How boring.
Hands up!
Let's clamp!
A regular meal is not in the fourth place.
The lunch is in the common dining room,
where you can eat delicious food at a reasonable price.
White rice is the best food.
Isn't that right?
Exactly.
And then, after lunch,
we finally had
the basic training of the heroes.
I...
go through the door
like an ordinary person.
This is the almighty!
Cool! He's really our teacher!
This is the costume of the Silver Age!
His style is so unusual
that I have goosebumps.
I teach the basic training of the heroes.
This is an object
where you are taught in different ways
based on how to be a hero.
You will learn the most useful things
on this object.
Well, let's get started.
The first thing we're going to do is
a battle test.
A battle?
A test?
And we're going to do this.
The costumes are specially made
to take into account your requests
sent to classes.
The costumes...
How do you dress?
Go to the beta field.
Yes!
They say that clothes
make a man, boys and girls.
And remember,
from now on
you are heroes!
These are amazing guys!
You look cool!
Well, let's get started!
Let's get started!
Costumes requirements.
Before entering the UA,
we filled out the questionnaire
on our own tricks,
measurements and preferences in design
so that the company
that has a contract with the school
could prepare the costumes
a week ago.
I need to go fill out the questionnaire
on all the tricks for the costume.
But I'm already registered
as without a trick!
Damn, what to do?
Registration of a trick?
Oh, you can change it.
Seriously?
Remember that everyone
checks and registers immediately
when entering the school.
But there are cases when people find out
that their tricks are not as they thought.
That's why you can change the record
once or twice.
They will not accept significant changes,
but if you had a trick,
then everything should be fine.
I'm home!
Oh, I accidentally dropped it.
I'll have to apologize.
With a return!
And the language!
Congratulations on entering!
I hurried with the conclusions.
The suit!
Maybe it doesn't look cool now?
Well, while you were sleeping,
tired of school,
I saw your notebook.
What?
Conscience torments me
for the terrible thing I told you.
I gave up already then.
But you did not give up.
You continued to persist
towards your dream.
Forgive the language.
Now I will fully
support you in everything.
This is the feeling of my mother.
What should I wear if not them?
Let it not be the most comfortable
or cool design, but it's okay.
This is my suit!
Oh, Deku!
Uraraka!
Looks cool!
I had to write down
what I want.
Mine came out very close to the body.
It's awkward somehow.
Heroic course is best for everyone.
How obvious!
So, it's time
to test the battle, teacher.
Oh, so this is Ida.
Looks cool.
Looks like we'll get a head start
of the entrance exam.
Do we have a battle in urban conditions again?
No, we will take two more steps.
Most of the battles
with villains happen outside.
But looking at the general figures,
then more criminals
commit crimes inside buildings.
Take hostages.
Barricade houses.
Illegal deals.
In a society full of heroes,
smart villains hide in the shadows.
In this lesson, you will be divided into heroes and villains for a 2v2 fight in the room.
And without explaining the basics?
This is a battle for you to understand the basics.
But this time your task will not be a simple robot destruction.
Then how to determine victory or defeat?
Can we beat them?
Will the punishment for failure be an exception, like the teacher from Ava?
How will we be divided?
Check out my cool hat.
I answer all questions!
Listen carefully.
Scenario?
The situation is this.
The villains hid a nuclear weapon somewhere in their shelter.
The heroes are trying to neutralize it.
The heroes must catch the villains or return the nuclear weapon at a given time.
The villains must protect the nuclear weapon all the time or catch the heroes.
Just like in American fighting.
The teams of the rivals are determined by the draw.
Do we provide all the cases?
By the way, professionals often have to unite with heroes from other agencies.
Maybe that's why?
I see.
So we are preparing for the future.
Sorry for my rudeness.
It's okay.
Let's get started.
Team A.
Team B.
Team C.
Team D.
Team E.
Team F.
Team G.
Team H.
Team I.
And Team J.
Cool!
It's probably destiny.
I'm counting on you.
Seriously.
I need to start talking normally, otherwise...
And the first ones to fight will be...
These guys!
Team A.
Team D.
The villains.
Everyone else, follow the observation point.
Yes!
The team of villains, go first and get ready.
In five minutes, the team of heroes will come in and the battle will begin.
Yes!
Young Ida, young Bakug, learn to think like a villain.
It will help in a real battle.
Put yourself to the test.
Don't give up.
Don't give up.
Don't give up.
Don't give up.
Don't give up.
Don't give up.
Don't give up.
Don't give up.
Don't give up.
It will help in a real battle.
Put yourself to the test.
Don't be afraid to get hurt.
Yes.
If everything goes far, I will stop the fight.
Yes!
Let it be training, but it hurts to be a villain.
So our task is to protect this...
cardboard...
Hey!
So Udeko has a miracle?
You saw that unusual power.
But it seems that it is associated with great risk.
But you get very angry when it comes to midoriya.
Did he dare to trick me?
Damn it!
Remembering the plan of the floors is also a task.
But the Almighty looks the same as on TV.
It seems that there will be no punishment like Izawa.
We can grow up.
Why are you so nervous?
But this is because we are against Kachan.
And there is also Ida, so I feel that he should be on guard.
I see.
Bakugo is the one who teased you, right?
He is cool.
I will definitely surpass the Almighty and become the most rated hero of all.
It's hard with him.
But his goal...
confidence...
strength and a miracle...
are much better than mine.
But...
That's why now...
I'm not going to lose.
A predetermined battle between men?
Hey, sorry, this is not your problem, Uraraka.
It's mine, we're a team, right?
Let's try.
Well, let's start the close combat training between A and D teams.
So, guys, you don't relax either?
Young Midoriya, here you are, an ordinary student.
I will strictly evaluate you without any favors.
We penetrated without problems.
There are a lot of blind zones here, be careful.
Let's go.
I still can't control one for all,
so I can't use it on people,
otherwise they will die from the blow.
I need to come up with something with my strength and Uraraka's miracle.
I need to work with my head.
These are the advice for battles in closed rooms and cramped spaces.
Analyze the heroes for the future.
Remember!
Uraraka, are you okay?
Yes, thank you.
Deku...
Just a scratch.
Come on, Deku, don't turn away.
I knew you would find me first.
An unexpected attack at the beginning?
Bakugo is cheating, it's not for men.
A sudden attack is considered.
They are now fighting for real.
Midoriya was able to dodge.
But the fight continues.
I will not inflict so much damage to stop the battle,
but I will be close to it.
Wow, just like a master of martial arts.
What's wrong with him?
He guessed my movements.
Kachan.
You usually start with a right blow from a wide angle.
How much do you think I watched you?
I analyzed and recorded all the heroes
that you considered amazing.
In the notebook that you burned and threw away.
My name does not always mean useless.
Kachan.
My name means I can do it.
But Deku sounds like I can.
I like it.
Deku.
If you continue, I will never forgive you.
Even if you are scared.
This is me in you.
And I hate you.
The continuation follows.
To be continued.
To be continued.
To be continued.
To be continued.
To be continued.
Midoriya, let it be a battle trial,
I'll do my best not to disgrace the name of my heroic family.
Ida, you're playing the villain now, aren't you?
Well, I'm a very insidious villain, you know.
He's in the role!
Next time, Deku vs. Kachan!
I didn't know that Uraraka played baseball!
Beyond! Plus Ultra!
