I'm sure that he erased his magic, so he's just unrealistically strong.
He's equal to the power of the Almighty.
Let her go!
Destroyer!
I'm going to destroy you!
I'm going to destroy you!
I'm going to destroy you!
I'm going to destroy you!
I'm going to destroy you!
All of us, including the teachers, were surrounded by fear by the forces of darkness.
But the deeper the darkness,
the brighter the light shines in her.
The Almighty!
My Heroic Academy
I'm going to destroy you!
I'm going to destroy you!
I'm going to destroy you!
I'm going to destroy you!
I'm going to destroy you!
I'm going to destroy you!
I'm going to destroy you!
I'm going to destroy you!
I'm going to destroy you!
I'm going to go
I'm going to destroy you
I'm going to destroy you
I'm going to destroy you
I'm going to destroy you
I'm going to destroy you
I'm going to destroy you
I did not see Radio cult's mask, so I carried the mask on my back.
On my way, I met a young Eid and learned about what was going on here.
It's not a joke to be angry at me,
to think about how terrible it was for these children and how desperately they fought.
But I can proudly say that
now everything is fine.
After all, I'm already here.
All-powerful!
All-powerful.
He doesn't smile.
You're late, hero.
Useless garbage company.
Episode 12. All-powerful.
Is this All-powerful?
I've never seen him alive before.
He looks terrifying.
Don't stand there, deer.
If we kill him, then...
I'm sorry, Aizawa.
What?
Guys, run to the exit.
Take care of Aizawa.
He's unconscious, so hurry up.
Yeah.
All-powerful.
Bad.
Bad.
Bad.
I'm sorry, Father.
He hit me while he was saving them.
They call it the right to use force.
He's a bolster, as I expected.
My eyes don't have time to follow him, but not as fast as I thought.
So it's true that he's getting weaker.
All-powerful, you can't do it.
This one with his brains out.
He held out a blow that didn't break my arm.
He probably...
And he's on the spot.
All-powerful.
All-powerful.
He didn't even blink.
He probably...
Young Midoriya.
It's all right.
Karalina!
Nobu.
Destroyer!
Is it really not working on him at all?
In that case...
He doesn't even have any hits on his face.
It's not surprising that he's able to absorb hits.
If you want to hurt Nobu,
then you have to be effective.
Will he let you do it?
That's another question.
Thank you for the hint.
If it's all true, then it'll be much easier for me.
Hey, hey.
Here, take this.
Cool.
These guys clearly underestimated the All-Powerful.
I'm sorry.
How did he get such an explosion from the suplex?
We just can't reach the All-Powerful.
Even though he's not strong as a teacher, he's always watching the recording.
It's true that they have a way to kill him,
but we can't help him with anything right now.
If we set ourselves up and get caught,
then we'll only complicate the situation for him.
Instead of worrying about the villains,
we'll try to help him.
Maybe we were too nervous.
He's amazing.
But...
But...
I know...
Every day on the way to school, I read the news about the heroes.
When they were talking about the fact that the All-Powerful isn't in the USJ,
the three fingers that three fingers are in the USJ,
the three fingers that three fingers are in the USJ,
the three fingers that three fingers are in the USJ,
they probably meant...
that the All-Powerful has reached his limit.
Probably because he's been using his strength for too long.
I'm the only one who knows.
I got this wound in a fight with the villain five years ago.
Half of the respiratory system is destroyed.
I lost my stomach.
I'm so exhausted from constant surgery and their consequences.
I'm so exhausted from the constant operations and their consequences.
Now I can be in a heroic form, no more than three hours a day.
I save people with a smile on their faces.
The symbol of the world cannot allow itself to be subdued by the power of evil.
A smile to hide the pressure under which the hero is.
And also to suppress the fear within yourself.
I am the only one who knows the secret of the Almighty.
And how hard it is for him.
There. That's how it is.
Tried to immobilize him by sticking him deep into the ground?
You can't stop him like that.
Because he's as strong as you are.
Good job, Black Fog. Unexpected opportunity.
Damn, this is my vulnerable spot. Stop it!
Well, fun.
Is this your first attack?
You should have prepared better.
Black Fog.
I don't want someone's blood and guts to mix with mine.
But for someone like you, I'll make an exception.
You're too fast to be seen with your eyes.
It was my job to immobilize you.
Then when you're halfway inside, close the portal.
And tear you apart, that's my job.
Assui.
What is it, Midoriya?
Bring the teacher Izawa instead of me.
What?
Okay, but why?
No. No, All-Mighty.
Midoriya!
You still need to teach me so much.
All-Mighty!
Young Midoriya?
Who are you?
How stupid.
Get out! Don't stand in my way, Deku!
Take this!
Frozen?
Young Todoroki?
All I know is that you got here to kill All-Mighty.
You controlled the movement of the ice and stopped it so as not to freeze me too.
Thanks to that, the grip was weakened.
All-Mighty!
What?
Damn, I couldn't get cool.
Maybe you'll stop drinking.
Empty place.
The symbol of the world can't be killed by such a waste like you.
Kachan!
Guys!
Kachan!
Todoroki! Bakug!
What the fuck?
Let them sort it out. Let's go.
Okay.
Guys...
Wait, is that Nitsu there?
Hey!
Hey, come here!
Ochaku-chan?
Hey, help us!
He's heavy!
Teacher Izawa?
Let's go!
Give it to the Almighty.
When the rest of the teachers arrive,
go to a safe place.
Okay?
Black fog...
Our transports are going out of order.
We're in the West.
You're a useless bastard.
You're just the way I imagined you to be.
Only some parts of you can turn into a foggy teleport.
And this teleport was covering your real body, wasn't it?
Then...
Oh my god, that was dangerous.
If you were completely out of the fog
and not susceptible to physical attacks,
you wouldn't say it was dangerous.
Don't move!
If I don't like the way you move,
I'm going to blow you up!
He doesn't act like a hero.
Not only did they immobilize them,
they're almost unharmed.
Kids nowadays are still capable of surprising.
Their reputation will deteriorate if they ally with the villains.
Nomu.
His body is down.
Is he still able to move?
Guys, step back!
What?
He didn't take any hits?
Who told you that's all he's capable of?
He also has super regeneration,
but Nomu was better to counter your 100% potential.
He's the best.
First, we need to get back our transport.
Move it, Nomu.
He's fast!
Kachan!
Kachan!
You dodged!
Cool!
Shut up, you idiot.
I didn't see anything.
Then what?
So it was...
...the same guy.
That's right.
That's right.
So it was...
...the Almighty!
He was protecting the boy?
What?
There's nothing human about it.
It was for the sake of saving my comrades.
There was no other choice.
By the way, a little earlier,
that unnoticeable guy was going to hit me with all his might,
you know?
Violence in the name of others is just wonderful.
Isn't that right, hero?
You know what, Almighty?
I'm angry at this world,
which divides the same violent actions
into heroic and villainous,
deciding what's good and what's bad.
The symbol of the world, right?
You're just a tool for suppressing violence.
Violence only creates more violence.
The world will know about it when we kill you.
This is madness.
In the eyes of people like you,
I only see cold calculations.
You just like to do all this evil, don't you, liar?
He bit me so fast.
Three against five.
Kachan has already discovered the vulnerability of the fog.
These guys are crazy,
but if we cover the Almighty,
we'll be able to drive them away.
No.
Run.
You would have had to, Tuga.
Don't get in the way, I'm a little early, right?
There was a completely different situation there, young Todoroki.
Thank you.
But now everything is fine.
Just watch the profe go all out.
Almighty, you bleed and at the same time...
Almighty...
Nobu, Black Fog.
Take it.
And I'll deal with the milk suckers.
It's true that I have about a minute of time left.
I'm weaker and faster than I expected.
Let's finish this and go home.
But I have to do this.
Hey, we still have to get in the way.
Why?
Because I am...
the symbol of the world.
That's why...
Damn, I told you
that his ability is to absorb blows.
Exactly.
He went to the hand-to-hand fight.
Wow!
I can't get close to them.
Your charm absorbs blows,
but does not nullify them.
So the charm has a limit?
Created to fight me on equal terms.
If you can withstand my 100% potential.
Then I will do more than 100%
to crush you.
Bleeding,
he fights with all his might.
He doesn't just beat to the core.
In every blow.
He invests more than 100% of his power.
He is a hero.
He always finds a way out
from a difficult situation.
Hey, villain!
Have you ever heard these words?
Beyond the limit!
Plus...
Ultra!
Hey, what a shiver!
What a shiver!
Explosion?
Did the villain fly through there?
Looks like it.
It's power.
It's omnipotent!
There is no one else
capable of something like this.
And it's true.
Hooray!
Did we get into comics?
As if there was no absorption of blows.
This rough force is amazing.
What power!
Does it mean that he was so fast
that the villain just didn't have time to recover?
So which one is the best?
Is this the world of professional heroes?
Omnipotent!
I've really weakened.
In better times,
five blows would be enough.
Now I need more than 300.
And now...
I have nothing left in my hand.
Now, villain!
I think we all want to finish it faster.
Did he really cheat?
Let's continue.
To be continued...
To be continued...
To be continued...
To be continued...
To be continued...
To be continued...
To be continued...
To be continued...
To be continued...
Now scream at the end of the sunset!
Beyond!
Plus Ultra!
