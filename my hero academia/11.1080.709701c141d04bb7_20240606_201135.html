        <pre>Kill the symbol of the world.
Kill it.
Nice to meet you. We are the Aliens of the Villains.
It may be insolent on our part,
but we invited ourselves to the House of the Heroes of the UA Academy
with one goal, so that the omnipotent symbol of the world
could bring down its last breath.
Guys!
Idiots!
It's the Three-Headed One!
He erases the miracle with one glance!
Elder!
Yes?
I trust this task is for you.
Run to the Academy and tell them about what's going on here.
But it will be a shame for the Elder to leave everyone in danger.
Use your miracle to save others.
Black Hole!
What does it mean to fight?
This is the only way to win.
The Lover Crush!
Even I...
Even I can...
Get out of the way! Get out yourself!
I think we've overcome the first obstacle.
You both are very cool.
The Heroic Academy
My Heroic Academy
The Heroic Academy
The Heroic Academy
The Heroic Academy
Get out of the way, you scoundrel!
I ate well this morning, so these things will stick all day.
We were very lucky that it caught everyone.
I was very risky.
In an ordinary situation, they would have left someone in reserve.
Midoriya, stop it.
You're scaring me.
Instead of thinking about the past, you should have figured out what to do next.
You're right.
Are you okay?
Yes.
In any case, our main goal is to ask for help.
The best solution is to go along the coast and avoid the central square on the way out.
Good point.
Teacher Aizawa has led a lot of villains to the central square.
But there are too many villains.
Of course, Teacher Aizawa is trying to suppress them.
But I think he overestimated his strength, jumping into the crowd of villains for our protection.
Wait, Midoriya, are you really going to...
Stupid, stupid!
I didn't think of anything that could stop him.
But if we could at least make Teacher Aizawa's life a little easier...
We had our first victory in our first battle, when we were underestimated.
We were mistaken that our forces were effective against the enemy.
Episode 11, the game is over.
Climbing Zone.
To throw and kill you, right?
I don't like to say this,
but you look like losers who don't know how to use their magic.
This guy, the moment we teleported here, is he really a child?
Where is he?
I spent so much effort to get everyone together.
The killing of the Almighty...
It seemed to me for the first time that they had gathered their best forces and could beat him.
But now it becomes clear that those who attacked us are just a pitiful bunch of weak feedback.
Judging by what I've seen, only four or five of them are really dangerous.
If that's the case, then my next step will be...
Hey, at this stage, your cells will slowly die out.
I want to become a hero, so I would like to avoid something as cruel as this.
Why did you decide that you could kill the Almighty?
What is your plan?
Climbing Zone.
It's scary.
Did you see that? It looked like I was looking at the face of death.
What kind of guys are they? What do they want from us?
You'll find out later.
Now we need to figure out how to get rid of them all.
Then give me the weapon.
You're shooting like electricity.
Don't slow down, deal with them.
You saw it during the close combat training.
We were in a pair.
I'm just covering myself with electricity.
I can charge from a distance, but I don't control this process.
You two will be affected too.
It's just like some kind of road.
Even if we wanted to call for help, we wouldn't be able to.
The signal is turning off.
Now you can't count on me.
I'm counting on you.
You're a guy, stop whining.
Then we'll use you as a shocker.
Seriously, you fool?
Oh, it worked.
I'm cool.
You two, lie down on me.
What a fool.
Enough games, kid.
You two need to take everything seriously.
Sorry, but at this moment it seemed like a great idea.
Jirokiwaka, with the miracle of the power outlet.
Insert the power outlet into the speaker on your feet.
It can adjust the sound of your heartbeat to the explosive readings.
It can also catch barely audible sounds.
Kuminari, you should have asked for a guidance system in your suit.
Done.
What?
I need some time.
To create something big.
A blanket?
Do they think they can protect themselves from us?
This is a 100-millimeter insulating fabric.
Kuminari.
I see.
In that case, I can't hold back.
Now I'm worried about the others.
We're moving to them quickly.
Wait, you don't have enough clothes on your chest.
I'll create it again.
Yaoi Rose Momo, the miracle of creation.
It can create any object,
which is possible thanks to its extensive knowledge and understanding of the atomic structure of materials.
Impressive powers.
Kuminari, don't look here.
Come here.
Kaminari Denki, the miracle of static electricity.
When it makes too much charge, its brain also turns off.
And for a while it becomes unimaginably stupid.
Hey Midoriya, let's just see how the others are doing, okay?
I know.
We'll run away if it's a little dangerous there.
Kuminari, the miracle of static electricity.
It can create any object, which is possible thanks to its extensive knowledge and understanding of the atomic structure of materials.
23 seconds.
Final boss?
24 seconds.
25.
Damn it!
You're constantly moving, but there are moments when your hair closes your eyes.
When you complete one action, the intervals become shorter and shorter.
Don't get so tense. Wipe your head.
My elbow is crumbling.
This trick is not intended for a long battle with a group of enemies, is it?
You usually fight differently.
What are you good at?
So this is in fast fights after a sudden attack, right?
Even so, you decided to take the front attack against the crowd.
You decided to save your dear students?
You're so cool! So cool!
By the way, hero...
I'm not the final boss.
Izawa's teacher!
A black hole that absorbs everything around and turns into dust.
Clearly, an amazing trick.
Unfortunately, Thirteenth, you are a hero who specializes in saving from natural disasters.
As expected, you don't even have half the experience of a regular hero.
Portal gate!
You will turn yourself into dust.
He's coming!
He's coming!
He's coming!
He's coming!
He's coming!
He's coming!
He's coming!
He tricked me!
Teacher!
Ida, run!
Hurry!
Use the miracle to save others!
Kill him!
One of the children who was not thrown away.
We are waiting for the Almighty.
The appearance of other teachers will complicate our plan.
Guys!
Have you trusted me?
The whole class!
I can't!
Go!
Hurry!
Guys, wait for me!
Impudent boy!
I won't let you get out!
The automatic door can knock her out, but will I have enough strength for this?
You're a jerk.
Die!
The villain.
The world of professionals.
And we still don't know anything.
I'll tell you something, look at my head.
He is an anti-symbol of the world.
The artificial man Nomu.
Sounded with the support of the Gym Club.
The site of the Vkontakte group vk.com slash gymfans.
And also subscribe to the Twitch channel, twitch.tv slash gym club.
Earthquake zone.
Die!
Is that all?
They are weak.
Great, then let's go and save the others.
If we are here, then the others should also be inside the building.
I am worried about the guys who do not have combat skills.
Besides, jump forward.
We slowed down the 13th.
If the 13th could swallow that fog, then this would not have happened.
As men, we must take responsibility.
If you want to, then get out yourself.
If you want to, then get out yourself.
And I will smash this teleporter.
What, are you behaving like a child again at such a time?
Besides, the attacks of this guy.
Get out.
This teleporter is the only way for the enemy to retreat.
I'm going to block it for them at the right time.
Not that we don't have a way to fight the fog.
Enough to shiver.
If such weaklings are sent against us,
then the others will also be fine.
The speed and reaction are just amazing.
Listen, since when are you so calm and reasonable?
I thought you were more like...
Die, die, die!
I am always calm and reasonable.
That's it.
Then let's go, if you want it so much.
Wait!
Faith in your friends.
Is this so manly, Bakug?
I'm following you.
Fire zone.
Don't kill him, he's too fast.
I see him, he's there.
First, I need to make sure that the enemy didn't catch me.
Hurricane zone.
Got you!
Only six.
If we reduce the number of enemies a little bit,
before the help arrives...
And you're naked with four eyes.
Die!
I don't know how to explain it,
but if it's on him,
then it means that he has a physical body.
Go, Ida!
Body?
Damn!
But...
I won't let you!
Go!
Start the engines.
He will call for help.
This is the end of the game.
You can erase the miracles.
Wonderful, but nothing special.
In front of the face of the crushing force,
you are as if without a miracle.
I don't know how to explain it,
but if it's on him,
then it means that he has a physical body.
It's like breaking branches.
I'm sure he erased his miracle.
It means he's just unrealistically strong.
He's as strong as the Almighty.
Midori, I can't take it anymore.
Are you sure you have something on your mind?
Shigaraki Fog.
Black Fog.
Did you kill the 13th?
I knocked it out of order,
but there were students who I couldn't separate.
One of them was able to escape.
What?
Black Fog.
You?
Don't be our way back.
I would have torn you to pieces.
We can't stand against a dozen of professional heroes.
The game is over.
Damn, we lost this time.
And what about you?
The game is over.
Let's go back.
They're leaving?
They just said they were going back?
That's what I heard.
Thank God we're saved!
Yeah, but...
I have a bad feeling, Midori.
Yeah, just go after everything they've done.
Didn't they want to kill the All-Powerful?
If they just leave like that,
the U.A. will significantly strengthen security measures.
The game is over?
What's going on?
What did these villains come up with?
Oh, yeah.
Before we leave, let's deal with those
who the symbol of the world
values so much.
The Game Over
Damn.
You're good.
Clean your head.
Damn, damn, damn!
He is very different from the previous opponents. I have to save Asua and run!
Let her go!
Destroyer!
Destroyer!
My hand is not broken?
Did I finally learn to control my strength at such a moment?
I did it! I was able to withstand a strong blow!
Great!
When did he...
Was it really not his fault?
You didn't think they went so far because they found a way to kill the All-Powerful?
It can't be!
You're moving well.
Your Destroyer, are you a fan of the All-Powerful?
Well, you're done for.
Well, you're done for.
How dare you!
Now everything is fine.
All right.
I'm already here!
All-powerful!
All-powerful!
Oh!
We see the continuation.
The continuation follows.
All-powerful!
All-powerful!
