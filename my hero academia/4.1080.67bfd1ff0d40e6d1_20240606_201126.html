        <pre>In the school, in which they train those who want to acquire the skills of professional heroes.
Among similar schools, the most popular one, and it's not easy to get here.
The acceptance rating of the new ones is less than one to three hundred every year.
The hero who rejected the national prize of valor.
Hero number one. All-powerful.
The hero with the highest number of open cases.
The inflamed type of hero.
The winner in the nomination of the best engineer of the last eight years.
The best engineer.
Studying in UAE is an obligatory condition for everyone who wants to become a great hero.
Therefore, I also took part in the entrance exam of UAE.
I follow.
To meet my dream. To become a hero.
My Heroic Academy.
I am a hero.
I am a hero.
I am a hero.
I am a hero.
I am a hero.
I am a hero.
I am a hero.
I am a hero.
I am a hero.
I am a hero.
I am a hero.
I am a hero.

I am a hero.

The entrance exam of UAE.
Battle Center B.
What is this?
The size of the city?
And they have several of these on the territory of the school?
UAE is just a wonderful place.
As stated in the requirements, you guys will pass the ten-minute battle test in urban conditions after the presentation.
Three different types of villains are located throughout the zone of the school.
You get points for each of them, depending on its complexity.
Your task is to use the pritches to earn points by destroying the villains.
Training battles.
Why are they so calm?
Isn't anyone nervous?
And the equipment combined with the pritches.
And the equipment combined with the pritches.
And the equipment combined with the pritches.
And the equipment combined with the pritches.
And the equipment combined with the pritches.
And the equipment combined with the pritches.
This is the girl I met at the school gate.
So, we're in the same center?
Oh, yes. I should thank her for that time...
This one, too?
Looks like she's trying to concentrate.
What are you trying to do?
Did you decide to interfere with other participants?
The guy who almost crashed into the gate.
The one who's always shaking.
Well, at least less than one opponent.
I'm so lucky.
I feel like the others are happy to be here.
So, let's get started!
What are you waiting for?
There are no reports in the real battle.
Go, go, go!
Your test has begun!
What?
Huh?
What?
I... I'm already lagging behind!
I'm lagging behind!
Calm down.
Don't be afraid.
Everything's fine.
Everything's fine.
I have the Almighty with me!
Great!
You swallowed your hair.
But I still feel myself.
Ha-ha-ha!
That's not surprising.
What do you think your stomach is doing?
You'll feel the changes in two or three hours.
I'm so nervous.
I need to hurry home, take a shower and have breakfast.
You've become a suitable vessel, but you've become in a hurry.
You didn't even have the opportunity to test it.
Be prepared for the consequences for your body.
What?
I don't have time to explain it in detail, so I'll tell you one thing.
When you use my spell, one of them all,
squeeze your butt tight and shout from the bottom of your heart.
One point!
The target is captured.
I'll destroy you!
It's getting closer, closer, closer!
Why am I frozen?
Idiot!
Why?
Thanks!
Lazar!
Merci!
We've become a great team.
But I don't think we'll meet again.
Adios!
Will we meet again?
6 minutes and 2 seconds left!
Damn, I need to do something!
Glasses!
I need to get them quickly!
Oh!
It's that girl!
Cancel!
It's 28 points!
What?
28?
45 points!
45?!
It's already 32!
Hey, it's mine!
Back off!
Whoever made it ate it!
The number of villains is rapidly decreasing!
Damn!
In the practical exam,
the examiners were not told how many villains are in their area.
They don't have much time in such a territory.
They have to look for villains on it.
Understanding, ability to assess the situation faster than others.
Cleverness, ability to use in different circumstances.
Controversy, ability to remain calm in any situation.
And pure combat courage.
Basic abilities that you need to know
Basic abilities that you need to be a hero.
Which bring points to the test.
And this year the participants look very promising.
Well, it's too early to say anything yet.
The real test will begin now.
Pregrada, a fallout with a large collection of villains.
I advise you to avoid him.
Why is he so huge?
The threat of universal destruction.
Under such circumstances, the true essence of people is revealed.
This is not a joke!
I have to run away from here!
Crawl, crawl, crawl! I still have zero points!
Less than two minutes left!
Two minutes?
Everything will be in vain!
Everything that the Almighty gave me will be wasted!
Damn!
It would be bad if you fell, right?
There is no point in fighting this villain.
But this gives you the opportunity to shine bright for her.
And show yourself to the fullest.
Clench your butt!
And shout from the bottom of your heart!
Destroyer!
Here he is.
He showed himself to the fullest.
The most important quality of a hero.
The spirit of self-sacrifice.
The feeling is similar to those when I tried to save Katchan.
But they are different. This time.
One minute left!
Wait!
This is the power of the Almighty!
Now I can jump so high!
It should be easier to land!
Damn!
Broken?
You have become a suitable vessel.
But you have become in a hurry.
Be prepared for the consequences of your body.
Here it is!
What a fool I am!
Ten months is too much time to prepare!
I can barely control this acquired power!
I was so angry just for a second!
I just had to stand on the starting line!
Think!
What to do?
The Detroit Destroyer!
If I direct this blow to the ground,
both my legs and right hand are broken.
I only have time left!
And time!
If I hit too early or too late, I will die!
Even if I survive, I still have zero points!
I break my left hand and have zero chances!
No!
Cancel!
I'm saved!
No!
She saved me!
Is she all right?
I don't see any damage.
I'm so glad!
And...
Thank you!
I'm so glad!
I'm so glad!
I'm so glad!
Thank you!
I'm so glad!
Thank you!
If only I could get at least one point!
Time's up!
What's wrong with this guy?
He suddenly jumped on the barrier.
It looks like he has a power-up spell,
but it was unusual.
But if he had such a spell,
then why did he pretend to be a loser?
Did he pretend to deceive others?
But it doesn't look like he could achieve anything with it.
In any case, he is undoubtedly an amazing guy.
They let go of the main thing.
Didn't they see it?
He jumped on the villain to save that girl.
He realized that there was little time and that it was dangerous,
and that he needed to gain points to get through.
But he still didn't think for a second.
If we weren't at the exam,
then I would definitely do the same thing!
Wait.
The exam?
Definitely?
Wait a minute.
Good. Great job!
You did a good job.
Here, take these marmalades.
Oh, thank you.
Yeah, yeah, and you too.
Thank you.
This mademoiselle is the support of the UAE.
Oh my God.
You hurt yourself so much with your own spell.
As if his body is not used to his spell yet.
Chmoki-chmoki.
Disgraceful granny.
What was that?
UAE's highly qualified school nurse.
A young heroine and a healing girl.
Her miracle is the acceleration of the body's regeneration.
Only thanks to her, UAE can conduct such dangerous entrance exams.
Let's finish here.
Does anyone else need help?
I see.
If this exam is designed this way,
then it is...
a week later.
Izuku.
Izuku.
Izuku.
Are you okay?
Why are you smiling at the fish?
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm fine.
After self-evaluation, I realized that I had barely passed the written exam.
But it was overshadowed by a large and fat zero for the practical exam.
And from the moment of the entrance exam, I was unable to contact the Almighty.
The results should come today or tomorrow.
Yeah.
I think it's great that you submitted your application to UAE.
Yeah.
I didn't even tell my mother what happened to the Almighty.
I continued to keep this secret so that he could continue to be a symbol of the world.
I couldn't tell anyone about it, even my family.
Almighty.
After you saw the potential in me,
I'm sorry I couldn't develop it.
But I did what I thought was right.
Almighty.
Izuku.
Izuku.
Here it is.
It's here.
It's here.
I'm here as a projection.
Almighty?
Wait, is this a letter from UAE?
What?
I filled in some papers, so I couldn't contact you.
I'm sorry.
Actually, I came to this city to work in UAE.
Almighty, are you in UAE?
Huh?
What's going on?
Rounding up?
Well, I have to talk to him about something right now.
Oh, I'm detaining everyone else.
Okay.
Okay, as you say.
You scored zero points on the practical test.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
You scored zero points on the practical test.
Of course, that means you didn't pass.
I knew it.
I knew it.
I knew it, but...
I'm so sorry.
But that's not all.
And now I'm going to entertain you.
Alla, look at this video.
I'm sorry.
I...
That's the cute girl.
She came to ask about something after the exam.
About what?
What do you think?
Look further to find out.
Well, the guy with curly hair and springy hair.
Do you know who I'm talking about?
Well, the one who doesn't stand out.
Hey, can I give him some of my glasses?
I heard what he said.
If I could get at least one glasses.
So I thought he still didn't have any.
What can you do?
It's because of me he lost his glasses.
There was no need to put yourself in such danger.
He saved me.
I'm begging you.
Please.
I'm begging you.
You have not only a miracle.
Your actions inspired others.
Previously, the entrance exam was evaluated not only
by the number of glasses collected for the villains.
You may ask about it,
but you can't give him your glasses.
In any case, there is no reason to give him glasses,
girl listener.
How can the hero's course not accept
who saves others and does the right things?
Do you think this is an empty chatterbox?
Whatever.
This is a job that requires to risk your own life
to prove your words in practice.
Glasses for salvation.
Judged by the members of the commission.
This is another of the qualities
that we pay attention to here in the UAE.
Midoriya's language is 60 points.
Uraruka's eye is 45 points.
You both passed.
This is too incredible.
Come on, young Midoriya.
This is your Heroic Academy.
Yes!
After all the past events,
my life has changed and continues to change.
And now the school life I dreamed of begins.
The continuation follows.
To be continued...
Izuko!
Welcome, young Midoriya.
This is the UAE School, your Heroic Academy.
All-powerful, I will do my best
to test our skills on the first day.
Your class leader Aizawa is merciless
and excludes those who have shown bad results.
Be careful.
What? Next time, what am I capable of now?
Oh no, the index finger of Midoriya!
Go beyond!
Plus Ultra!
