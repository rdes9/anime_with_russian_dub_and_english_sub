        <pre>My Heroic Academy.
Hey, tell me please, how are the classes of the Almighty going?
I'm sorry, but I need to go to the medical center.
Tell us, what is the symbol of the world in the role of a teacher?
What is he?
Well, well, he's very pumped up.
What can you say about the Almighty as a teacher?
He has once again made me believe that the school I attend is the best of the best.
And his nobility and character are flawless.
But students always see him as fun.
This is a unique opportunity to become a professional hero under the guidance of the best of them.
Sorry, can you tell us about the Almighty?
Oh, aren't you the guy who was caught by a dirty villain?
Get off me.
So, about the Almighty...
Wow, you're so crumpled up.
What are you going to tell us?
He's not at school today.
You're in the way of the classes.
Please leave.
I'd like to talk to the Almighty.
I think I've seen him before.
Aren't you a bit over the top?
I can't believe that the Almighty managed to be a hero under such circumstances.
Well, just a couple of minutes.
Let me see the Almighty.
Stop, you fool!
What?
It's a U.A. barrier.
That's what they call it.
What the hell?
If someone tries to get in without a student ID or a pass, the security system works.
Apparently, there are sensors all over the school.
Seriously?
You doubted that you were cool.
You could at least comment briefly.
Seriously, we've been here for two days.
And they're still silent.
The news that the Almighty became a teacher in U.A.
shocked the entire nation.
Various media gathered at the school, making a lot of noise.
And everyone learned about it.
That's right.
Everyone.
Episode 9.
Well, don't let me down, Ida.
You did well with yesterday's combat training.
I watched the video and the results.
Bakuga, you're talented.
So stop behaving like a child.
I know.
And you, Midoriya.
You got out again, breaking your arm.
You can't justify yourself anymore,
saying that you don't control the miracle.
I don't like to repeat the same thing.
As soon as you can control the miracle,
you'll be able to do a lot.
Don't waste your time, Midoriya.
I got it.
So, let's get back to the cool stuff.
Sorry for being late, but today you...
Let's take another test?
You have to choose your age.
Ordinary school classes.
I want to choose myself.
Me too.
I won't refuse either.
This job is for me.
I'll be your leader.
In an ordinary class, this means
routine duties for students.
But in the Heroic Course,
this position will allow you to learn to become a professional,
leading the group.
Silence, please!
It's a great responsibility to lead others.
Not everyone can do that.
This is a call for the trust of the people around you.
If we want to choose a leader,
democratically,
we have to make a choice.
You raised your hand higher than everyone else!
Why did you suggest it?
We don't know each other yet.
In this case, if everyone votes for themselves...
That's why the one who gets the most votes
can be considered the most suitable candidate.
What do you think, teacher?
I don't care if you have time to decide until the end of the lesson.
Thank you very much!
Voting results.
Izuku Midoriya, 3.
Momo Yowrozu, 2.
I have three votes!
Why Deku? Who voted for him?
Well, you know, it's better for him than for you.
What did you say?
It would be bad if Bakugo finds out.
I give up! I give up!
Zero votes.
I knew it would happen.
It all depends on the call.
Did you vote for someone else?
Well, you wanted to be the teacher yourself.
What did you think, Ida?
So, Midoriya will be the teacher,
and his deputy is Yowrozu.
Seriously?
How annoying.
Not so bad.
After everything that happened,
Midoriya is quite suitable for this.
Yowrozu also showed herself
when we analyzed the results of the battle.
There are a lot of people here today.
That's because all the training courses
of the heroes in support and management
have lunch in one place.
What a delicious rice!
Even though I was chosen as the senior,
I'm not sure I'm suitable for this.
You're suitable.
Everything will be fine.
Your courage and reasonability
in a critical situation
cause trust.
That's why I voted for you.
Was it you?
Didn't you want to be the leader, Ida?
You wear glasses and all that.
Uraraka doesn't care at all about what he says.
Wanting to do something and being worthy of it
are different things.
I just did what I thought was right.
Just? You don't usually say that.
Oh, that's...
I thought about it.
Are you rich, Ida?
Rich?
I tried to change the way I talk
so that people don't call me that anymore.
Yeah, my family has been
a hero for several generations.
What? Cool!
Do you know about the Urbo-hero Ingenium?
Of course I know!
He's a very popular hero
who has 65 partners in the Tokyo Agency.
Just don't tell me.
Yeah, he's my older brother.
He said it right away.
He's a very cool guy.
He's a favorite of all heroes
who respect the law and follow the people.
I decided to become a hero
because I want to be like my brother.
But I think
it's too early for me to follow the others.
Unlike me, Midoriya
understood the practical importance of the entrance exam
so he's more suitable for this role.
This is probably the first time
I've seen your smile, Ida.
Really?
I always smile!
Ingenium for Ida
is like everything to me.
But I need to tell him
about the entrance exam.
Siren?
Safety level 3 is broken.
What?
Evacuate all students immediately.
What's the level of security 3?
It means that someone has entered
the school territory.
We haven't had this in three years.
We need to hurry.
Don't push!
Wait, I'm falling!
I told you not to push!
What happened?
As expected from the best of the best.
Everyone reacts quickly
in a dangerous situation.
They are so fast that they provoked panic.
I'm falling!
Midoriya!
Who could have entered?
These are
journalists!
Call the Almighty!
Is he here?
We told you he wasn't here.
Comment briefly and we'll leave.
You will answer once and you will continue to ask questions.
We know you.
They entered illegally.
So you can consider them villains.
Calm down, Mik.
Let's wait for the police.
I guessed who it could be.
It's just the media.
Guys, calm down!
Wait, someone fell!
Don't push!
Where is the teacher?
Are you busy trying to fix everything?
Guys, wait, stop!
Kurishima, what the hell?
If there is a person who knows
that everything is fine,
no one noticed.
Everyone is in panic.
Uraraka!
Ida!
What would Midoriya
or my brother
do in such a situation?
Uraraka!
Make me
weightless, Uraraka!
Everyone has a place in sight.
Start the engines!
Ida!
Be brief,
clear and brave!
Guys, everything is fine!
It's just the press!
Don't worry!
Everything is fine!
It's UA!
Let's behave like the best of the best!
The police are here!
Great!
Goodbye, yellow press!
Come on, old man, start!
Now we have to
do other great duties!
But first,
can I say something?
I think that the oldest
should be Ida Tenya!
He was able to draw
attention to everyone in such an unusual way.
I think that Ida
will do better than anyone else.
I think so too.
What Midoriya said is true.
Ida helped us a lot today
in the cafeteria.
Yes, he was like this
drawn man on the signs of the exit.
You're wasting your time.
I don't care what you're doing there,
just hurry up.
If the old man chose me,
then there is no choice.
From now on, Ida Tenya
promises to do her best
in the role of the class leader.
So hold on, mister backup exit!
Ida's backup exit!
Don't let us down!
What about me?
How could ordinary journalists
do such a thing?
Someone set everything up.
Could some villain
really get into it?
Or was it an announcement of war?
Listen up, heroes!
Don't follow me!
Try and I'll kill
this rich family!
Aren't you afraid, family?
Misuri!
Strike!
Why?
Because I was passing by
on my way to work.
I got hit and ran away.
It's not good if I'm late, but...
I got slower.
When I gave
young Midoriya one of them all,
my strength became weaker.
Besides,
after that incident,
the time I could be in this form
was even shorter.
Did you tell young Bakuga?
I'm sorry.
I didn't even tell my mom.
But for some reason,
I don't know what to tell him.
I'm sorry.
I thought, since he doesn't look like
NATO's tail and I don't need to explain,
but apparently,
his honesty is the other way around.
Fortunately, young Bakuga
didn't take your words seriously.
So this time,
let's forget about it.
But don't think about telling him anymore.
Please, think about
how to have such a power.
If it's heard,
it will be heard by those who will try to steal this power from you.
And it should be kept secret
to protect society
and for your safety.
Do you understand me?
Although he is a suitable vessel,
he is just a 15-year-old boy.
I have to get ready.
Someone barricaded in the neighboring city!
Today's hero training
was decided to be carried out
under the supervision of three teachers.
Me, the Almighty and one more.
It was decided.
I wonder what the reason is.
Excuse me, what are we going to do?
A disaster, a shipwreck
and all sorts of things.
This is a test of salvation.
Salvation?
Looks like it's going to be hard again.
Right?
Idiot, this is a duty of a soldier.
I can't wait to start.
Nobody will beat me in water.
Quack, quack.
Hey, I'm not done yet.
Can you decide
whether to go in a suit or not?
Some of them
will not be suitable
for the task.
The training will pass
outside the school,
so we will get there by bus.
That's all, get ready.
The test of salvation
What did I admire?
This test is another step
to the dream of becoming
the greatest hero.
I will not let you down.
Oh, you are dressed in a sports suit.
Where is yours?
He broke during the last training.
I'm waiting for the support company
to fix him.
Class 1A, get ready.
To make everyone sit down,
line up in two rows
according to your requirements.
And he left.
Someone stop him.
Damn, I didn't think
that the bus would be like this.
It didn't make sense.
I say everything
that comes to mind.
Midoriya.
Yes, what is it, Asui?
Call me father.
Okay.
Your miracle is just like the Almighty.
What?
Do you think so?
Well, I'm not...
Wait, Tsu, the Almighty
doesn't hurt herself using it.
They just look alike.
But it's great
to have just a strengthening miracle.
You can do a bunch of cool things.
My strength is a strength booster,
good against others,
but unfortunately it doesn't look very good.
And I think it's a very cool miracle.
And this miracle is clearly for a professional hero.
Professional? Well, don't forget
that you know about the hero's popularity too.
My puppet laser
is a miracle for a professional.
But the bad thing is that
your stomach hurts from it.
Well, since we're talking about strong and cool,
it's obviously Todoroki and Bakugo, right?
Bakugo is always on the platoon,
so he's unlikely to become popular.
What did you say? Do you want to wave?
See?
We've known each other for a long time.
It's amazing that everyone already knows
What kind of words are these, bastard?
You're done!
They're making fun of us.
I can't believe my eyes.
Wow, Yui.
What a vulgar conversation.
But I even like it.
We've arrived. Stop fooling around.
Yeah!
I've been waiting for you, guys.
The space hero number 13
is a gentleman's hero
who saved many people
from natural disasters.
Damn, I love number 13.
Let's go inside.
Let's wait and see.
Wow, it looks like a USJ park.
Shipwreck.
Crawl.
Fires.
Hurricanes.
And so on.
This is a training ground
developed by me
to simulate various disasters and accidents.
The Great Territory of Disasters.
Or USJ.
It's true, USJ.
Number 13, where is the Almighty?
He was supposed to meet us here.
About this?
Looks like he was too many heroes
on his way here
and he ran out of time.
That's why he's in the rest room.
I'm sorry.
I was supposed to stay a little longer.
I'm sorry.
He's completely lost his common sense.
Let's take measures then, just in case.
There's nothing to do. Let's get started.
Let's see. Before we start,
let me say one thing or two.
Or three.
Or four, five, six, seven.
The number is growing.
I'm sure you all know about my wonder,
the black hole.
I can swallow anything
and turn it into dust.
You were able to use this wonder
to save people from various disasters.
Yes, but it's a force
that can be easily killed.
Do some of you have
similar wonders?
In the superhero community,
the use of a wonder is strictly regulated,
so at first glance,
there are no problems.
But please don't forget
that there are a lot of wonders
that can be easily killed
with incorrect use.
Thanks to the Aizawa test,
you learned about the hidden
capabilities of your forces.
And thanks to the all-powerful training,
I think you learned
the lesson about the danger of using
them against others.
This test is a new start for you.
You must learn to use
your wonder to save people.
Your wonder is not
to hurt others.
I hope you will learn
that the wonder is to help people.
Thirteen, you're so cool.
Cool!
That's all.
Thanks for listening.
It was amazing!
Bravo!
Well, first...
Get together and don't move!
Thirteen, defend the students!
And who is this?
Is this like an entrance exam?
Has the class already begun?
Don't move!
This is a villain.
It so happened that during the test
of our time,
they appeared before us.
Let's continue.
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
