Hey, Udeku has a miracle, doesn't he?
You saw that unusual power, didn't you?
Did he dare to trick me?
Damn it!
It's hard with him, but his goal, confidence, power and a miracle
are much better than mine.
Therefore, now...
I'm not going to lose.
Well, let's start the close combat training between the A and D teams.
Come on, Udeku, don't turn away.
I won't do so much damage to stop the battle, but I'll be close to it.
Wow, just like a master of martial arts.
What's wrong with him?
Did he predict my movements?
My name doesn't always mean useless.
My name doesn't always mean useless.
Kachan, my name means...
I can do it!
My Heroic Academy
Kachan, my name means...
Heroic Academy
Kachan, my name means...
Heroic Academy
Kachan and I lived next door.
That's why we've known each other since childhood.
The entrance is prohibited.
Come on, let's get the villain out!
Yeah!
Yeah!
He was one of those who could easily give everything.
The leader of the local attack of children.
He pointed out what was right and what was wrong.
Kachan was full of confidence.
I thought he was cool.
But...
But his display of wonder
changed him in the worst way.
Even though you're scared.
This...
I hate you!
People are not equal since birth.
That was the reality of society.
Which I learned at the age of 4.
Episode 7. Deku vs. Kachan.
Hey, Bakuga!
Report the situation!
What happened?
Just shut up and defend the object!
I'm very angry right now!
I didn't ask how you feel.
Hey!
He turned off.
He took it and started acting on his own.
What's wrong with him?
Damn!
What is Bakuga saying?
There's nothing to do with these cameras without sound.
He's talking to the wireless transmitter partner.
You are allowed to take it along with the building plan.
And the capture tape.
As soon as you turn the enemy in it,
it is believed that you caught him.
Time is 15 minutes.
And the hero doesn't know where the nuclear weapon is.
Exactly!
The hero is clearly in an unfavorable position in this situation.
The heroes must be able to adapt to any situation.
Besides, didn't the teacher Aizawa tell you our credo?
Well, you know...
Together with me!
Plus Ultra!
Monsieur.
There's Bakuga.
Uraraka, go!
You're looking around, and you're too self-confident.
Capture tape?
Page number 10.
Page 18.
Luckily, I saw the movement of three heads with my own eyes.
What's next?
It's Kachan.
He won't slow down.
And he'll swing right again.
I was right.
This guy is amazing.
He doesn't even use the premonition against the leader of the entrance exam.
He always had a quick reaction in critical situations.
He spent years making recordings and teaching them.
And now the knowledge he has accumulated brings results.
In achieving his goal.
This time he hit first, so I couldn't predict his movements.
Now he's on guard.
Come back, Deku!
I can't get close to him now.
I need a plan.
Hey, you!
You got me, didn't you?
Did you like to fool me all the time?
Yeah?
You have an impetuous trick, don't you?
Come on, attack me.
I'm better than you anyway.
I'm better than you anyway.
I'm better than you anyway.
I'm better than you anyway.
I'm better than you anyway.
I'm better than you anyway.
I'm better than you anyway.
Looks like he's not mad at me.
That's scary.
I heard from the young Midoriya that the young Bakug has a lot of self-esteem.
But that's too much.
He forgot about Uraraku and focused on me.
He knew it would be like that.
If they wanted to put security on the sidelines,
they should have put Eido on the sidelines.
I'm sure Kachan understands that.
And that means he came here voluntarily.
And at the moment they don't fight back.
And at the moment they don't fight back.
And at the moment they don't fight back.
And at the moment they don't fight back.
And at the moment they don't fight back.
And at the moment they don't fight back.
At first glance, our chances of winning are minimal.
If Uraraku and I get through the villains' logs,
we'll get caught in a trap.
Even if we both fight Kachan,
we might not make it in time.
Okay.
The only way is that Uraraku has to find weapons and Eido.
And then I'll join her in a two-on-one battle.
Okay, we win.
Unless I can beat Kachan.
Everything will be fine.
Everything will work out if he can't touch me with his hands.
Where are you?
Damn it!
I forgot to tell you, Kachan.
You're a monster!
How can you compete with me?
I'm not trying to compete with you at all.
Believe me.
I'm taking my words back.
That's why I'm going to...
My name means I can do it!
He's just dust on the road.
Wow, Kachan.
It's easier than simple.
Damn it!
Izuku, you can't do anything at all, can you?
Can you read the hieroglyph Izuku like Deku?
Oh, Kachan, you can read.
Can't you?
And Deku is called the one who can't do anything.
Really?
Stop it.
Why don't you know?
Kachan, how many times did he jump?
Seven.
Cool.
Come on, Kachan.
And you, Deku?
Not a single one.
Not a single one.
Why can't you?
Wow!
Wow, Izuku!
That's so cool!
Oh, that's a very cool miracle.
Indeed.
A bright miracle is like being created for a hero.
Right, Katsuki?
Oh, I get it.
I'm amazing.
No one is cooler than me.
You're lucky, Kachan.
Your miracle is so cool.
I hope I'll get mine soon.
It doesn't matter what kind of miracle you have.
You won't beat me.
He's just dust in the road.
Did you hear that?
Deku has no miracle.
Seriously?
It's called the one who can't do anything.
Unlucky.
Unlucky.
Don't worry, Izuku.
No one is more remarkable than Deku.
March forward, Bakugas!
Kachan!
Hey, are you okay?
I'm fine.
Kachan is strong.
See?
I was fine.
Hurry up and get back.
Okay, I'll be right back.
Everything was fine.
Are you okay?
Can you stand?
It would be bad if you hit your head.
Don't look at me like that.
In your eyes?
I read a request for help.
Stop!
I...
I'm much better than him.
I found it.
Now I have to tell Deku to wait for him to come.
Bakuga was born a villain.
But this is what I need for this training.
So I have to behave like a villain.
Exactly.
This is another test to make me the heir
of the hero family of Ida.
Villain.
I'll dress in the colors of darkness to become a hero.
I'm...
an insidious villain.
That's too serious.
You're here, Uraraka.
I knew you'd come here alone.
After Bakugas started to fight,
your trick allows the object to become weightless.
That's why I took away all the extra things
before you came.
Now you can't prove your trick.
You're a failed hero.
He looks more and more like a villain.
Deku.
Uraraka.
Speak.
Ida found me.
I'm sorry.
He's slow now.
Where are you?
In the middle of the fifth floor.
Almost above me.
We probably don't have much time.
If we don't make it in time, our opponents will win.
I can't.
I can't lose this fight.
They're charged.
Kachan.
Why don't you use your magic?
Or do you think you can beat me without her?
You underestimate me, Deku.
I have no other choice.
I can do it.
I can.
I'm not afraid of you anymore.
You probably already know your tricks.
But my explosion trick
works in a way that makes me look like nitroglycerin.
And I explode it.
If they do as I asked,
then I can store the sweat inside these arms.
And it can't be.
Stop, young Bakugo!
Are you trying to kill him?
He won't die if you don't touch him.
It was supposed to be a lesson.
Young man!
Young Midoriya!
Is it...
allowed to do that?
Wow!
I'm so excited!
I'm so excited!
I'm so excited!
Wow!
The more it accumulates in the arms,
the stronger the explosion.
Come on!
Use your magic, Deku!
I'll make you give up.
Even if you fight all your life.
Bakugo, answer me!
Did you do that?
What are you doing there?
This is my chance.
Explain it now!
If we capture the weapon, we will win.
I won't let you go, hero!
We just need to touch the weapon
so that it is considered captured.
It can now turn into weightless.
Cancel!
A special technique
that can only be used in combat.
Your magic is not dangerous
if you don't touch anything.
I will protect the object
until the time comes.
Deku is trying his best there.
Hey, what's wrong, Deku?
I didn't touch you.
So you can move.
Come on, attack!
He's in a hurry.
His costume is designed
so that his magic works
at long range.
Uraraka, how are you?
Deku!
You're ignoring me again?
Unbelievable!
Teacher, stop them!
Bakugo's cat got away!
He'll kill him!
No.
I won't do so much damage
to stop the battle.
It's strange, but he's still
partially in his mind.
I don't know if it's stupid
or for some reason,
but anyway...
Young Bakugo, if you use it again,
I'll stop the battle,
and your team will lose.
What? Attack the building with such power?
It contradicts your task
to protect the shelter.
It's a stupid plan, both a hero and a villain.
You'll lose a lot of points
because of this.
As a teacher, I have to stop this.
But...
Go to the colony near the window.
Right now!
What the hell with him?
Then we'll fight with fists!
Bad! I can't dodge!
Counterattack!
Pick a moment! Now!
What was that?
He doesn't look like the one
who thinks a lot.
But he's more cunning than I thought.
What do you mean?
He changed the trajectory with an explosion
of a smoke curtain and did the same
attacking from behind.
To hit, resisting such inertia,
requires a clear control
of the force of the explosion.
He's very talented.
Even too much.
Hey, I'm here!
Here's your favorite right!
Deku!
You!
Worse than me!
He won't give me a chance to think.
I can't do anything.
Too strong.
All that's left is...
a challenge!
He can grab him by wrapping
a bandage and a grip!
Real heroes don't do that.
I thought Midori was pretty cool too.
Bakugo definitely has the instinct
of a fighter.
I have to stop them.
But...
I don't want to stop them
for his sake!
He's running away?
He's not worthy of a man.
But he has no choice.
That's weird.
Why?
Why don't you use your magic?
Are you underestimating me?
No.
You've been acting the same
since you were a kid.
So you've been underestimating me
since you were a kid?
You're wrong.
You...
You're amazing!
That's why I want to beat you!
I want to beat you!
And surpass you, moron!
Don't look at me like that!
Fucking attack!
Bakugo!
The first real emotion
besides what he showed me.
I'm sure that for you
it's possible to achieve
the future you dream of.
Detroit...
I told you it would be bad, teacher!
You're both...
Wait, Uraraka!
Yeah?
I still can't beat you
one on one.
But...
The Destroyer!
What?
I'm sorry, Ida.
Improvised super-movement!
Home Run Comet!
And it's called Home Run?
I'm sorry, Ida.
I'm sorry, Ida.
I'm sorry, Ida.
I'm sorry, Ida.
I'm sorry, Ida.
I'm sorry, Ida.
I'm sorry, Ida.
I'm sorry, Ida!
desease!
notch!
imos!
Leahy!
Leahy, te!
I wasn't going to use it, because I can't. My body can't stand the impact.
Aizawa's teacher also said that, but that's all I could think about.
Hero. Hero's team has won!
The following is the continuation.
The following is the continuation.
You kids still have something to strive for. This is just the beginning.
The following is the starting line of Bakugan.
The young Bakugan will have tears in his eyes.
Beyond.
Plus Ultra.
