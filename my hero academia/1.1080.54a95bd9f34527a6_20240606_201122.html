        <pre>This means that Katchan doesn't see that he's crying.
If you continue, then I...
I will never forgive you!
Even without a reason...
You're still portraying yourself as a hero, Deku!
You're still portraying yourself as a hero, Deku!
Katchan
Not all people are equal to birth.
Such was the truth about the society that I learned at the age of four.
I experienced my first and last disappointment.
Katchan
What a huge villain!

It all began in China, inei training center.
There was a child born.
And then superpowers began to appear all over the world, no one could even understand the reason.
And very soon the paranormal became common, and dreams came true.
The world became a superhuman society, in which 80% of the population had a special gift.
And in this chaotic world, the profession that everyone dreamed of was at the center of attention.
And this profession...
Oh, these are the fists of death!
Oh, but the guardian of justice, thanks to his power!
This is a striking hero!
Hey, don't go behind the line, it's not safe here.
Rescue specialist, the hero is back, too!
Damn, the transformation!
I can't believe it!
I can't believe it!
Damn!
Damn, turning into a monster is a cool miracle!
What did he do?
He stole someone's bag and got out of it when he was pressed.
With such a miracle, he steals bags.
Sorry, the train is late!
Yes, I don't know when I can get to work.
Come on, you can do it, Kamui!
Go away!
Who is fighting?
Wooden Kamui!
Young talent, rising star among superheroes!
I asked myself and answered in detail, kid.
Are you a fan or something?
Well, yes, something like that.
Illegal use of abilities at peak hour of theft?
Greetings to physical damage.
You are the birth of evil.
Oh, here it is!
I'm so happy!
I'm so happy!
I'm so happy!
I'm so happy!
I'm so happy!
I'm so happy!
I'm so happy!
Lover of power and the birth of evil.
Lover of power and the birth of evil.
Oh, here it is!
Show us something cool, wooden man.

What?
Today is my first day. My name is Mountain Lady. Nice to meet you.
She got all the attention.
Together with the appearance of abilities, the level of crime has significantly increased.
While the government was trying to change the laws, brave people began to commit heroic deeds, as if in comics.
Watching the paranormal and defending evil, they soon received recognition from people.
Heroism has become an official profession.
The state pays them for their success, and they receive recognition.
Titan transformation? With such a miracle, it will definitely be popular.
But if you take into account the corresponding damage, its application can be limited.
No, it depends on whether it can ...
Hey, hey, you even draw! You yourself want to become a hero! Well done, keep it up!
Yes, I will try!
Episode 1. Izuku Midoriya. The beginning.
So, now that you are in the third grade, it's time to seriously think about your future.
Now I will give out the boards for professional orientation, but ...
We are all!
Do you want to get into the group of heroes, huh?
Yes!
Yes, yes, everyone has a great miracle, but using your strength at school is against the rules.
Teacher!
Don't count me out to the rest.
I'm not going to go the same way with these rejections.
Katsuki Bakuga.
What the hell are you, Katsuki?
Exactly!
You are secondary characters, so get out of here!
Oh, if I'm not mistaken, Bakuga wants to get into the U.A. senior school.
U.A.? National senior school?
I heard that she is in the top school this year.
And they accept only the best.
That's why nothing shines on you.
I passed the exams perfectly.
I'm the only one who can get into U.A.
I will definitely surpass the almighty and become the most ranked hero of all.
My name will be on the list of the richest people at the beginning!
Oh, yes, Midoriya also seems to be going to U.A.
What? Midoriya?
What? Midoriya?
For nothing!
It's just that the school doesn't approve the admission to the Heroic Course.
They canceled this rule.
There was simply no precedent.
Hey, Daku!
You've already abandoned them.
You don't even have a prelude.
How can you compete with me at all?
Wait, Katchan!
I'm not trying to compete with you at all.
Believe me.
It's just that this is my goal since childhood.
And that's why...
I won't know until I try, right?
What do you mean, until you try, huh?
Do you think this is a joke?
What the hell can you do?
You have no prelude!
12 o'clock in the morning, the same city.
Thief!
Hold him!
Catch him if you can.
What?
Not a single hero around?
Usually someone appears right away.
He took advantage of the morning ruckus.
There are a bunch of people around who, as soon as they get caught, use their preludes.
They don't care about the end or the end.
Actually, there is.
What?
Because I'm here!

Hey, let's go to karaoke.
There's nothing to do anyway.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Hey, let's go to karaoke.
There's nothing to do anyway.
Morning ruckus in all the newspapers.
I'll hurry home and write everything down in the notebook.
We're not done yet, Deku.
Katsuki, what's going on?
What, analysis of heroes for the future?
In nature, or what?
Medals.
It's none of your business.
Give it to me.
It's cruel.
What?
Most of the first-grader heroes have stories from school days.
I want to be known as the only student who got into U.A.
because of this poor municipal school.
You see, I'm a perfectionist.
What a pity.
So, in any case...
don't dare to get into U.A., bro.
Well, well, at least you said you'd answer.
It's up to you.
He's just a pity.
He still can't accept reality.
If you want to become a hero so desperately, there's a quick way.
Trust me.
Believe that you'll be born with a miracle in the next life and jump off the roof of the school.
What are you looking at?
Idiot, if I jumped, you'd be to blame for leading to suicide.
Think before you speak.
Think before you speak.
It's not food, stupid.
It's my notebook.
Stupid.
Stupid idiot.
Mom!
Mom, computer!
Again?
Faster!
God, you've probably already screwed up 10,000 views.
I'm scared to watch this.
It was an old video.
A few years ago there was a disaster.
A video about a hero who showed himself for the first time then.
Do you see this?
He's already saved a hundred people.
It's crazy to go and not even ten minutes have passed.
It's impossible.
He's laughing.
Now everything is fine.
Why?
Because I'm here.
He's so cool.
When I get my miracle, I'll be just like him.
I think you should be ashamed.
So, is something wrong with him?
Other children already have miracles.
Is he the only one?
Excuse me, madam.
You seem to be from the fourth generation.
Can I ask about your miracles?
Yes, of course.
I can attract small objects to myself.
And a husband can breathe with fire.
In the usual case, by the age of four, one of them would have appeared.
Or their combination.
In the past, when superpowers only appeared,
the results of research were published.
According to them, the presence of a miracle depends
on whether or not you have an index finger joint.
When part of the body is not used, they are considered unnecessary.
People who do not have it began to consider it a new stage of evolution.
On this X-ray, you can see that the tongue has two joints.
This is very unusual in our time.
But this means that he has no miracle.
Do you see this?
He has already saved a hundred people.
It's impossible to go crazy and not even ten minutes have passed.
He's laughing.
Now everything is fine.
Why?
Because I'm here.
Mom.
He saves everyone with a smile.
No matter what kind of trouble people are in.
He's such a cool hero.
Can I become a hero?
Forgive me, Izuku.
Forgive me.
Forgive me.
No, it's not that.
It's not that, Mom.
What did I want to hear from you then?
You've made up your mind, haven't you?
Exactly.
Don't worry about what others think.
Go on the chosen path with a raised head.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Are you a thief?
You are invisible, Kazmir Ema.
Don't worry.
I'll just grab your body.
Calm down.
Don't worry, it's only going to hurt for 45 seconds.
Soon you'll feel better.
I can't breathe.
You can't catch me, I'm liquid.
Thank you for your help, you're my hero.
I didn't think that someone like him could be in this city.
My body, my strength is leaving me.
Am I dying? Am I going to die?
Am I dying?
Anyone?
Anyone?
No.
Are you all right now, young man?
I'm here.
Tikhavsky Strike!
Air pressure!
Air pressure!
I can...
Hey, hey!
Thank God!
I'm glad you're all right.
I'm sorry I dragged you into a fight with the villain.
I usually don't make such mistakes,
but I was in a good mood on my weekend.
But you helped me a lot, thank you.
I caught him without any problems.
Hero number one!
All-powerful!
He's...
He's real!
He looks completely different in real life.
Oh, right.
And in real life?
He looks completely different in real life.
Oh, right.
An autograph!
Where do I write it?
In this notebook!
He's already left it!
Thank you very much!
I'll make this a relic as a family treasure.
Okay.
Well, I need to pass this bastard to the police.
Watch me on TV.
Are you leaving already?
Police officers are constantly fighting their enemies.
Wait.
I want to know more.
Well, then...
I'm counting on your constant support!
Wait.
Hey!
What the hell?
Let me go!
You've gone too far!
I'll die!
You're right.
I have a lot of questions for you.
Okay, okay.
I got it.
Now close your eyes and mouth.
Damn it!
It was scary.
Well, well.
Talk to people on the floor below.
I think they'll be able to help you.
Wait.
But...
No.
I can't wait.
But...
I think you need to make up.
Forgive me, Isaac.
Forgive me.
Forgive me.
What the hell can you do?
You're a monster!
Maybe it's true.
But...
Let it be so...
I am.
Can I become a hero if I don't have a miracle?
Can someone with no abilities become like you?
The fact that I met the Almighty is a miracle.
At that moment, I didn't even imagine how this meeting would change my fate.
