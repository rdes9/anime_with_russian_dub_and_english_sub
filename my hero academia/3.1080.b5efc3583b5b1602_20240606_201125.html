        <pre>Number one.
All-powerful.
The age of the type of miracle is unknown.
He appeared on the arena of the Heroic World and became incredibly popular because of his ability.
Since he appeared, the level of crime began to decrease every year.
His existence itself restrains the villains.
He became a symbol of the world, both in name and in reality.
You can become a hero.
What?
A midoriya?
Not at all!
You're a miracle!
How can you compete with me?
Forgive me, Izuku.
I wanted someone to tell me that.
And then the person I admire the most told me.
Can there be something more?
I don't know.
You deserve to inherit my power.
My Heroic Academy
Number one.
All-powerful.

My Heroic Academy
Number one.
A midoriya?
Not at all!
What kind of look is that?
It's just an offer.
A real show is ahead.
You have to decide whether you want to take my power or not.
What? All-powerful says that?
I'm talking about my power, boy.
In the newspapers, this is called inhuman power and reinforcement.
And I always joked about this question during the interview.
Because the symbol of the world, all-powerful, must be a hero from birth.
But I'll tell you the truth, boy.
My power was passed on to me as a sacred torch from the legend.
It was passed on to you?
Exactly.
And now it's your turn.
Wait!
Please!
All-powerful, your miracle is really discussed like one of the biggest secrets.
So often that the day does not pass without discussion.
But I really don't understand what you mean by inheritance and the transmission of the miracle.
I haven't heard anything about it before.
And in the discussions, this did not come up in the form.
Why, I wonder?
Maybe because there was no data about such a miracle in the available records from history?
Do you always start with a denial?
Hey!
What?
Maybe I'm hiding a lot, but I'm not lying.
This is power, to pass on power.
This is a miracle that I inherited.
The name of this ability is one for all.
One for all.
Exactly.
One person develops power and passes it on to another,
who also develops and passes it on.
This crystallization of power that unites the voices of those in need of help,
who have a brave heart.
But why are you giving me such incredible power?
I've been looking for a successor for a long time.
And then I thought that you would be perfect to inherit it.
You're just a fan of heroes.
No wonder.
You were more heroic than everyone else.
Oh, forget it.
Well, it's up to you to decide.
What are you going to do?
He told me so many inspiring words and even revealed his secret.
If, of course, there is no one, I can't find a single reason to refuse.
I'll do it.
Instant answer.
I didn't expect less from you.
Well, getting his power was far from an easy test.
It was never a friendly thing.
Episode 3.
Two days later, early in the morning.
Hey, hey, hey.
It's very comfortable to sit in this refrigerator.
If you could move it a little bit, it would be much easier.
Well, you know, your weight is like 274 kilograms.
No, I've lost my weight.
Now I weigh 255 kilograms in this form.
Still, why am I carrying garbage in the coastal park?
Well, you know, because you're not a suitable vessel.
You used to say the opposite.
I'm talking about your body.
My miracle is one of all.
This is the power of many people gathered together.
An unprepared body will not be able to accept it completely.
Your limbs will break off, and the body will explode.
What will they do?
So I collect garbage to train my body?
Exactly.
But that's not all.
Yesterday on the Internet, I found out that this part of the coastline has been clogged for many years.
Well, yes.
For some reason, a lot of garbage is being taken out here.
And people use it to illegally dump garbage here.
Locals also bypass this place by the side.
Heroes nowadays love all kinds of show.
In fact, this is a very dangerous place.
In fact, being a hero means helping everyone.
Let them say it's something boring.
You can't avoid these basics.
You will again open the horizon on this site.
This is your first step in becoming a hero.
My first step?
Clean this?
All this?
Young Midoriya, you want to get into the UAE, don't you?
Yes, very much.
Because you studied there too.
So I thought that if you go there and do it, you will definitely get into the UAE.
And you're still here.
Well, as I told you earlier, this is not something you can do without a reason.
It's sad, but it's a harsh reality.
The UAE is a hero's course, which is the hardest to get into.
Otherwise...
In 10 months before the entrance exam in the UAE, I have to prepare my vessel.
That's what I was talking about.
I developed a plan called Achievement of the Goals.
This is a training plan that will help you finish cleaning the beach.
Follow it every moment in your life.
Even the time for sleep is on.
Honestly, this is a very hard schedule.
Will you be able to do it?
Of course.
I have to work much more than anyone else.
Otherwise I won't be able to do it.
So my 10 months of hell began.
Take this to the entrance to the park and load it into the truck.
Depending on the shape and size, I use different muscles.
Run, run!
10 months will fly by and you won't have time to blink!
Let's pump up the tanks!
Well, with the appearance of superpowers, the act of building standards has been changed.
This is awful.
10 months like this?
It will be bad if I don't finish the exam in a week.
That means there are 294 days left.
It is also worth taking into account the recovery time.
If I rest for two days between training sessions and be productive, then the basic training will take 98 days.
If you take 5 hours of training morning and night, you will get 490 hours.
Also, cleaning the beach does not pump up a separate part of the body.
If I don't pump up my body evenly, nothing will come out.
Pumping up to create a body capable of everything.
Intensive training to become a hero.
The Almighty cannot constantly follow me.
Fedor! Hey!
Did the collision with the villain drive you crazy?
You are too self-confident to dream about UA.
Plus, you need to prepare for the entrance exam.
Nervous breakdown so quickly?
No, it scares.
I don't care what people say.
I'll be a miracle.
I'll be a hero.
I'll be so much more.
The Almighty
Hey, what's wrong?
Only three months left.
You can't pass.
Do you want to give up?
Do you want to relax and rest today?
Overload?
Achievement of the goal.
The plan of the American dream was built for your body.
So that you could complete it before the entrance exam.
And you didn't stick to it, did you?
If you overdo it, you will only hurt.
Don't you want to go there?
I want to.
But I just can't get there.
I need to work much more than the rest.
Or I won't be able to catch up with them.
I want to be just like you.
I want to be the greatest hero just like you.
Save people with a smile on their face.
Just like you.
He looks far into the future, doesn't he?
You're a really crazy guy.
I like it.
But if that's the case, then you shouldn't rush yourself.
But I understand your feelings.
Let the old man fix your plan.
You're not old.
Almighty.
6 a.m. on the day of the entrance exam.
Hey, hey.
He cleaned not only the area, but the whole beach.
Seriously?
Not a single rustle on the entire territory.
Is that true?
He was able to cope at the last moment.
It's more than great.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Mine!
Great job.
Almighty.
I did it.
I did it.
Yeah.
And you surprised me, kid.
Teenagers are just amazing.
Here, take a look.
That's...
That's you.
10 a.m. on the day of the entrance exam.
That's...
That's you.
10 a.m. on the day of the entrance exam.
You did a good job.
Very good.
The view of your path was barely noticeable.
But you definitely became a suitable vessel.
I feel like I'm playing unfairly.
You did it all for me.
I'm so happy.
What are you talking about?
It's all thanks to your hard work.
It's time for you to stop whining.
Well, it's time to reward you,
Izuku Midoriya.
Yeah.
That's what I was told once.
To get something only because of your luck
or because you were recognized.
That's two big differences.
Be proud of yourself.
This power is earned by your own efforts.
I accepted a reality that is amazing even for comics.
Now I have...
Eat it.
What?
It doesn't matter what it is,
as long as it has my DNA.
It's not what I imagined.
Come on, there's no time to prepare.
You'll be late for the exam.
I did it.
Although I didn't have time to check the power
that I got from the Almighty.
Eat it.
I swallowed my hair,
but did I really get his power?
Get out of the way, Deku.
Kachan?
Don't stand in front of me,
or I'll kill you.
Otrichka, let's both try.
Hey, isn't that Bakuga
from the incident with that villain?
Oh, yeah, he's cool.
From that very day on,
Kachan stopped clinging to me.
I'm so used to shaking in front of him.
But now I'm different.
Just remember,
the last 10 months,
take your first step
on the path to becoming a hero.
Here it is.
Are you okay?
This is my wonder.
I'm sorry I used it without permission,
but it would be bad
if you fell, right?
Aren't you worried?
Oh, well, I...
Good luck.
Bye.
I was talking to the girl!
Actually, I wasn't.
You all,
who came for the exam,
welcome to my show.
Come on, everyone,
say, hey!
Silence.
What an exquisite answer.
Then I'll quickly tell you
about the upcoming practical exam.
Are you ready?
Yeah!
And silence again.
Oh, this is the hero of the voice,
Sushimik.
That's right.
I listen to him on the radio.
Incredible.
All teachers are professional heroes.
Shut up already.
As stated in the requirements to the participants,
after the presentation,
you guys will pass the 10-minute
combat test in urban conditions.
After the presentation,
we gather in a special combat center,
okay?
Otherwise, they won't allow you
to cooperate with your friends.
You're right.
Although the participants
go one by one by numbers,
we are distributed at different points.
Good girl, or I'll kill you.
Damn, now I can't beat you.
Three different types of villains
are located
throughout the test zone.
For each of them,
you get points,
depending on its complexity.
You can also use magic
and earn points by destroying
the meeting villains.
Of course, attacking other
participants and doing something
anti-heroic is prohibited.
Can I ask a question?
Okay.
In our prints,
four types of villains are indicated.
If this is a print,
then the U.A.,
the most outstanding school in Japan,
should be ashamed.
We're going to take an exam,
because we want to be first-class heroes.
By the way, you there with curly hair.
You've been buzzing there all this time.
It distracts.
If for you it's just entertainment,
then you should leave immediately.
Sorry.
Okay, okay.
Reaching 7111.
Thank you for the great question.
The fourth type of villains
costs 0 points.
Simply put,
it's just a barrier.
In every arena point there is
a barrier that falls into
the bustle of large groups of people.
It can be defeated,
but it makes no sense.
I advise you to avoid it.
Thank you very much.
Sorry for interrupting you.
I see.
It's something like an obstacle
that you avoid in games, right?
Yes, it all looks like a game.
That's all I have for you.
In the end, I give you a gift.
The motto of our school.
The hero Napoleon Bonaparte once said,
The true hero
will never stop overcoming
the difficulties of life.
Go beyond the possible.
Plus Ultra.
Well, good luck with the test.
Heroic course of the U.A. school.
Entry exam.
Battle center B.
It's time to do it.
It's time to show everything
that I've achieved in 10 months
of training with the Almighty.
I will definitely become
a hero
that I've always dreamed of being.
The continuation follows.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.

Next episode.
Entry exam in U.A.
Elite institution
that has let many professional heroes.
I don't care about the written exam.
Will I be able to pass the practical one?
The strength recently obtained from the Almighty.
I wish you good luck on the exams.
What?
What's more important,
I was talking to the girl.
Next time, the starting line.
I'll tell the guy today
something amazing.
Plus Ultra.
