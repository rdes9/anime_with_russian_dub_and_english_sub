Now it's all right.
Why?
Because I'm here.
He's so cool!
He's so cool!
He's so cool!
He's so cool!
He's so cool!
He's so cool!
When I get my miracle, I'll be like him!
I think you should laugh.
Let it be true.
You're worse than a brood!
What are you without a miracle?
How can you compete with me at all?
What can you do?
What can you do?
Even if everyone thinks so...
Forgive me, Izuku.
Forgive me.
Forgive me.
No, that's not it.
That's not it, Mom.
I...
Let me...
Can I become a hero if I don't have a miracle?
Can someone become like you without a miracle?
Without a miracle?
I don't know.
Damn it!
Not now!
Most likely...
It's because I don't have a miracle.
Everyone is laughing at me all the time.
Probably because of this, I don't know for sure.
But I think it's really cool to save people.
To save people with a fearless smile on their faces.
I want to become the greatest hero, just like you!

What? Where am I?
What happened?
Texas Strike!
Oh, right!
That's the damn bastard!
If it wasn't for him...
Hey, Katsuki!
You're friends with Midoriya, aren't you?
You've gone too far.
He's to blame for getting in my way.
Relax.
It's just...
It's my childhood goal.
And that's why...
I won't know until I try.
Damn idiot with his childhood dream.
I'm so sick of him!
Maybe we'll go shopping then?
We'll have fun.
You'll go with us, Katsuki.
Yeah.
Then let's go to the one at the station.
There's usually a lot of stuff there.
You're disgusting.
What? If they catch us,
they'll record my personal file!
Hey, look!
A mask of invisibility with a great charm!
Episode 2
What is it like to be a hero?
You're blowing yourself up!
Wait, is she...
What?
A prankster?
Is she a prankster?
You're such a jerk!
Actually, I'm omnipotent.
She can't catch me!
You know, like in a park,
they always put their bodies in the pool
and strain their muscles.
It's something like that.
Stop lying!
It's impossible!
Omnipotent is fearless!
He saves everyone with a smile on his face!
He's the greatest!
Fearless with a smile, huh?
Now that you've seen me like this,
don't talk about it.
I got this wound
in a fight with the villain five years ago.
Half of the respiratory system is destroyed.
And I lost my stomach.
I'm so exhausted from constant operations
and their consequences.
Now I can be in a heroic form
no more than three hours a day.
It can't be!
Five years ago,
when you fought against the poisonous chainsaw!
And you are well aware of it.
But such a scoundrel
could not defeat me.
The information about this fight
was not given to me.
I asked them
not to spread it.
I save people
with a smile on their face.
The symbol of the world
cannot allow itself to be subdued by the power of evil.
A smile to hide the pressure
under which the hero is located.
And also to suppress the fear
within yourself.
Professionals always risk their lives.
I can't just say
that you can become a hero
even without a super-power.
I understand.
If you want to help others,
you can become a police officer.
They laugh at them
because the villains
bring them under the door.
But their work is also
worthy of admiration.
Dreaming is not bad at all.
But it is also worth taking into account
the real situation of things, boy.
Now I need to quickly
deliver the villain.
It can't be.
The villain!
What kind of hero will come to help?
I can't just say
that you can become a hero
even without a super-power.
The villain!
It's the villain!
Did you take the kid in the hostage?
No, I didn't.
But...
Did you take the kid hostage?
Oh, you coward!
What?
I can't grab him!
The fists of death!
Damn it!
Don't come near me!
I won't let you just swallow me like that!
Oh, you little...
What power!
I broke the jackpot!
With his magic and power, I can take advantage of that guy!
Wow, what is he doing?
Is he really a professional villain?
He's here!
A new hero, a mountain lady!
Wait, I need at least two lines to get through.
Explosions are not my thing.
Let others be the villains today.
I'm not a villain!
I'm not a villain!
Let others be the villains today.
Thank you for that!
My hands are busy fighting fire!
There are no firefighters yet?
How are things going on there?
He's sticky, he can't be grabbed!
And the guy is strong with a miracle and resists him!
I can't come to them for that!
It's hard to do anything against such a combination!
Damn it!
All we can do is wait for someone with a stronger miracle!
Let's minimize the damage for now.
Don't worry, I'm sure someone will show up soon.
I feel sorry for this guy.
But he'll have to endure a little longer to kill him.
If only I had the strength to take this villain down.
Listen, it seems everything is bad.
You can do it, heroes!
It happened at that moment.
I was distracted for a while.
I can't believe I made a mistake after instructing that fan.
I feel sorry for him.
I feel sorry for him.
You still haven't accepted reality, even though you're in the third grade.
It's time to seriously think about your future.
It's worth taking into account the real state of things.
Even the best said it.
You knew it too!
Reality!
You knew it, that's why you tried so desperately!
You knew it, that's why you tried so desperately!
You avoided it.
You didn't look into the eyes of the truth!
Is this the place where the explosion was heard?
Hey!
It turns out that I didn't notice how I refused.
Stop it!
It doesn't make any sense right now!
Why is this villain here?
Did he run away from the Almighty?
Or did he drop him?
He dropped him!
So, it's because of me.
Why are the heroes acting up?
They can't do anything.
Looks like the villain captured the schoolboy's hostage.
And they've been holding him for some time now.
I thought I was going to die in a few seconds.
Wow!
Hey, isn't that the villain that the Almighty was chasing today?
The Almighty?
Is he here?
I don't think I saw him.
He's here?
And where does he carry the Almighty?
It's my fault.
He can't do anything.
I feel sorry for him.
If you don't catch this villain,
everyone is just waiting for a hero with a strong spell.
I feel sorry for him.
Try to catch him.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Try.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I feel sorry for him.
Help is coming soon.
I feel sorry for him.
Someone...
A hero...
Will come soon.
Episode 7
Idiot!
Stop!
Stop!
That guy...
Deco...
Why did I run?
What am I doing?
Why?
Death explosion!
What am I doing?
What am I doing now?
Page 25!
Get it!
Kachan!
What are you doing here?
My legs moved by themselves.
I don't know why.
There were several reasons for that.
I think you should make up.
It's my fault.
How can you compete with me?
I won't try yet.
Kachan!
It wasn't my goal.
But right now...
In your eyes...
I read a request for help!
Stop!
I feel sorry for him.
I feel sorry for him.
Just a little more!
Don't stand in my way!
He will die!
Is he a suicide?
I really feel sorry for him.
All-powerful!
Even though I gave you advice...
I forgot to show you an example.
Professionals always risk their lives!
All-powerful!
Detroit Strike!
Detroit Strike!
Detroit Strike!
Detroit Strike!
It's raining.
Is it the air pressure?
There was a rising stream...
Did he make the clouds?
Wow!
He changed the weather with just one right fist!
It's amazing!
All-powerful!
All-powerful!
After that, the heroes gathered the sludge scattered around them...
And handed it over to police officers.
What were you thinking?
There's a limit to stupidity.
You didn't need to take that risk.
I got a lesson from the heroes.
But the coach was enough for everyone.
You have amazing endurance!
And this is a miracle!
When you become a professional, come to me!
You will definitely become a great assistant!
I wanted to apologize to the All-powerful.
But he was giving an interview.
I'll try to send him a message on the website when I get home.
Deku!
Kachan!
I never asked you to help me.
And you never helped me, Usiok!
I'm great!
I did great on my own!
You think you're better than me?
Do you want me to be in your debt?
Don't look at me from above!
Damn you!
All-powerful!
As Kachan said,
I didn't do anything and didn't change anything with my actions.
But I'm glad.
Now I can think about a more real future.
And here I am!
All-powerful!
How did you get here?
You were surrounded by reporters!
It was easier for them than it was for you.
Why?
Because I am All-powerful!
Boy,
I came to thank you,
make a small correction and offer something.
Don't be there.
Don't tell me about your life.
I would be an ordinary Bolton in a suit.
Thank you.
It can't be!
After all, it all happened because of me!
I stopped you from doing your job
and told you all kinds of things, although I don't even have a reason.
Exactly.
But thanks to you,
I was able to act,
because you were a fragile, helpless person.
Professionals have stories from school days.
Most stories have something in common.
Their bodies moved on their own.
For some reason,
I remembered my mother's words.
Forgive me, Isaac!
Forgive me!
Forgive me!
And you did the same, didn't you?
Yes!
It's not what you think, Mom.
At that time, I wanted to hear from you
the words that I wanted to hear.
You can become a hero!
You can become a hero!
Dreams can become a reality.
By the way, I forgot to mention
that this story is about how I became the greatest hero.
