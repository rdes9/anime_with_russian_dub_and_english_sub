        <pre>You're lucky, Kachan. Your miracle is so cool.
I hope I'll get mine soon.
No matter what kind of miracle you have, you won't beat me.
Just dust on the road.
Until recently, he was just dust on the road.
You have a great miracle.
Hey, you! You broke me, didn't you?
Did you like to fool me all the time?
Well, attack me with it.
I'm better than you anyway.
What?
What are you talking about?
What?
Improvised super technique. Home run cometa.
Is it called home run?
Captured.
From the very beginning you...
I wasn't going to use it.
Because I...
I can't.
My body can't take this kind of impact.
Teacher Aizawa said the same thing.
But...
That's all I could think about.
Someone told me...
You can become a hero.
That's why...
I'll become one.
My Heroic Academy.
The End.
The End.
In the practice of close combat in the premises,
the Heroic Team won!
What the hell?
The loser is all right,
and the winners are lying on the ground.
They lost the battle,
but won the war.
It's just practice.
To the medical center.
I know.
Right punch.
Deku guessed it.
Besides, he found a way to win in practice.
You're amazing.
That's why I want to win you.
I want to win.
And surpass you, moron.
Does it mean...
If we fought with all our might,
Deku could easily...
Let's go, young Bakugo.
It's time to analyze the result.
It doesn't matter if you win or lose.
To look at the past and learn from your own experience
is part of our job.
Episode 8. Bakugo's starting line.
Well, I must admit
that the young Aida was the best among them.
Isn't that one of the winners,
Ochaku or Midoriya?
There you go.
Who knows why?
I'm the All-Powerful Teacher.
That's because Aida was the best
at adapting to the training conditions.
Judging by what I saw,
Bakugo acted on his own,
motivating himself with personal insults.
As the All-Powerful Teacher said,
it's stupid to use powerful attacks in the room.
The same goes for Midoriya,
given the damage he got.
His plan wasn't well thought out.
Urarakage
weakened his alertness in the middle of the fight,
and her last attack was obvious.
Considering it to be a real weapon,
she couldn't have done something so dangerous.
Aida was preparing for the arrival of the opponents
and expected it to be a battle for weapons.
That's why his last attack got him in trouble.
The heroes' team won,
taking advantage of the fact that it was a training.
In fact, they were breaking the rules.
She said more than I expected.
Well, young Aida,
you could be a little more confident in some aspects.
But in general, everything is right.
You should always start from scratch
to study everything as it should be.
We should try our best.
Otherwise, we won't become professional heroes.
Momo Yaorouzu,
one of the four students,
recommended for the course.
Okay, listen up,
let's change seats and start the second battle.
Get to the point
after everything we've discussed so far.
Got it?
Training building B.
Team B are heroes,
and team A are villains.
Ojiro,
I want to set them on fire,
so I'll take off my gloves and shoes too.
Hagakure is the right decision
for an invisible person.
But as for a girl,
there is a moral problem.
Don't peek, okay?
Well, I don't see you anyway.
And now, let's start the second match
of close combat training in the room.
Shouji Mezuo!
A miracle!
Replicant hands!
The tips of his tentacles
can take the shape of any part of the body.
One of them is in the corridor,
north of the fourth floor.
The other one is somewhere on the same floor.
They're without shoes.
The invisible one is approaching
to set up an ambush and capture us.
Go outside.
It's dangerous here.
I'm sure our rivals
will defend themselves.
But it doesn't matter to me.
Damn, my legs!
It's a miracle!
Attack me if you want.
But you're hurting yourself
and you won't be able to fight
with all your might.
He doesn't damage
his friend's non-nuclear weapon.
Besides, he weakened the enemy.
And he's strong!
The heroes' team has won!
It's hot!
Damn, it's hot!
I'm sorry.
The difference in our forces
is too great.
Tadaroki Shouto!
He's another one of the four
in the recommended course.
It's a miracle!
Ice and flame!
The right one freezes, the left one burns.
The radius of attack and maximum temperature are unknown.
Cool!
What kind of miracle is this?
As expected from the recommended course.
Great!
Let's analyze the second battle.
Then the teams of the third match will continue.
Yes!
The training building of the I.C.
and N.V.S.
will begin in a moment!
savory
It's hard to get this介
really, personally.
Now, I missed something like one foi at the beginning.
Now they throw that tornado,
but I still have some power.
Am I too powerful?
Yes!
Tiny, tiny!
설й
oh, fuck
You're a twentie!
Team C.
Team G.
Team F.
Yahoo!
Sorry, sorry.
Good job!
No one got any serious injuries
except young Midori.
You were very good at training.
You were very good at training.
You were very good at training.
After such a good training,
the Aizawa teacher's lessons
disappoint us a little.
We can also have such lessons.
We can also have such lessons.
Well, I have to discuss
the results with young Midori.
Get changed and come back to the class.
Get changed and come back to the class.
All-powerful Patryatin!
Why is he in such a hurry?
How cool!
Young Bakugo is too proud
and there is nothing more fragile
than a fiery heart.
As a teacher, I have to
instruct him in the right direction.
But now...
Service exit.
If I teach...
I have little time left.
Damn it!
The program is available
with the help of the Gym Club,
the Viki.com site and the Gym Fans.
Also, subscribe to the channel
on Twitch,
twitch.tv, and the Gym Club.
The school year has just begun,
and he is already here for the third time.
Why don't you stop him, All-Powerful?
I'm sorry, healing girl.
Why are you apologizing to me?
You already gave him the first help.
So when the drip ends,
all that remains is to wait
for his body to recover slowly
overnight.
God, I know he's your favorite
and that you gave him your strength.
But that doesn't mean
you have to torture him.
I have nothing to say about that.
Because I wanted to understand
his feelings, I slowed down
to stop the training fight.
Even so...
Couldn't you talk
about One for All?
Yes, yes, Mr.
Born Hero, Mr.
Symbol of the World.
My trauma and this look
are known to all the Yoy teachers
and some professional heroes.
But the secret of my miracle
is One for All.
Only you, the director,
my close friends
and young Midoriya
can help me.
I know you don't want
to just work at the labras.
But is it really so important
to be a born hero
or a symbol of the world?
If I stop being one,
the superhero community
will be captured by the villains.
It's the duty of those
who have this power.
If that's the case,
it's really important to understand
what it's like to be someone's mentor.
Yes.
You can
become a hero.
Do you agree
to take my power?
One for All?
Destroyer!
Come on, young Midoriya!
This is your
Heroic Academy!
I still have a lot to learn
to get closer to my dream.
My name doesn't always mean
useless.
Kachan, my name.
So I can do it!
It's...
evening.
You finally woke up.
That's enough for today.
You'll be back tomorrow, got it?
As a result, I missed
my after-school classes.
Teacher Aizawa, I'm sorry
for this.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Teacher Aizawa, I'm sorry
for this again.
Oh, Midoriya is here!
You did it!
Cool!
I couldn't find a word when I was watching the fight.
You really got me!
I can't believe you fought
against Bakug, the best of the best.
You did a great job!
You did your best in the first match
and the rest decided not to back down.
You did a great job!
What?
I'm Kirishima Eijiro.
We're discussing training together.
I'm Seru Hanta.
My name is Aoyama.
I'm Ashida Mina.
You did a great job!
My name is Atsui Tsuyu.
Call me Tsuyu.
I'm Sato.
I'm...
I'm Amineta.
Where did you come from?
You're so noisy.
Takamiya!
This is not a chair for you.
Get down now!
What's wrong with that?
What?
It's more important that it's in your hands.
Well, you're right.
I can't allow any disrespect
to these boards
that once used our glorious
senior comrades.
You're too noisy.
Hey, Uraraka!
What kind of food do you prefer?
Moti.
What?
Didn't she heal your wounds?
Oh, it's because I'm pretty strong
and...
What?
But, Uraraka,
it's more important...
We all tried to stop him,
but he left without saying a word.
Hey,
have you been lying to me all this time?
You have!
You're a fag, aren't you?
Kachan!
Kachan!
What?
It's a secret
that I didn't even tell my mom.
But...
There's something
that I want to tell you.
My miracle
I got from another person.
What?
But I can't tell you from whom.
And I won't tell you.
But it's like a comic book story
that became true.
Besides, I still can't control it.
It's just a borrowed power
that hasn't become mine yet.
That's why
I tried to beat you
without using it.
As a result, I would hardly win,
so I had to use it.
I still have a lot to learn.
That's why...
That's why...
One day
I'll do this miracle
to my own
and I'll be able to beat you
with my own power.
I just came to tell you
that I didn't lie to him.
That I...
What kind of nonsense is this?
A borrowed power?
You're talking nonsense.
Are you trying to make me
an even bigger fool?
Huh?
What do you want to say?
Today
I lost to you.
And that's it.
That's it.
Watching the ice guy
I thought
I can't win.
It's stupid to use
such a powerful attack in the room.
So that he...
As a result, I agreed with
what the duck said.
Damn! Damn! Damn!
And you!
Damn Deco!
I'm just getting started!
Do you hear me?
I'll be number one!
You can't beat me again, you bastard!
And here he is!
Young Bakuga!
What would you know?
Pride is also important.
You definitely have the skills
of a professional hero.
You still need a lot more.
Let me go, all-powerful.
I can't move.
I can't move.
I can't move.
I can't move.
I will become a hero
that will surpass you
and without your advice.
What?
Well,
as you say.
It was said with confidence.
It's hard to be a teacher.
What was that?
A foreshadowed battle
between men.
It was more like Midoriya
just apologized to him.
A foreshadowed battle between men!
Kachan got carried away
with this idea.
But it doesn't change my goal.
I just have to
stay away from him.
Young Midoriya!
What did you talk about
with young Bakuga?
We were talking about...
I'm interested.
Let me go, all-powerful.
Well, actually...
Actually...
The sequel follows.
The End
The End
The End
A few days later
we'll find out
how dangerous
and insidious
the villain is
that all-powerful
warned us about.
Did you see that?
It says he became a teacher.
Hey.
What do you think
will happen
if the symbol of the world
is beaten by villains?
All heroes start with something.
Next time.
Don't let me down, Ida.
It turns out that young Midoriya
is inspired by his friends.
Go for it!
Go for it!
