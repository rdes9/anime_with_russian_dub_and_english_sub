You can not forgive me. I do not want your forgiveness. I just want to buy wine.
The Todoroki family had to change. I prayed that at least a little bit of it would improve.

Can everyone afford to move out after a break?
Can everyone afford to move out after a break?
Oh, yes.
Oh, yes.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah, yeah.
He never seen anything!
It suits you very well!
Yes, and it's really great!
Really?
I'm so happy!
Oh, is this a new bag?
It's heavy!
It's because of the wires.
With my magic, a big weight is not a problem.
Although the suitcase is heavy.
What's here?
Ah!
What's this?
I knew it!
Everything is wrong, Ashida!
Honestly, everything is wrong.
What?
I'm just keeping it with me.
I'm just keeping it with me.
I'm just keeping it with me.
I'm just keeping it with me.
What?
Did you get used to that crazy thing?
Yes.
Seriously, how fast?
Are you talking about that thing
when black shit flew out of your hand?
Yes, I called them black whips.
Wow!
That's so cool!
Yes, the internship with hero number one
is another level.
You're developing faster!
I still release whips only for a moment.
The application is limited,
but they are...
powerful.
Midoriya!
Bakugo, what are you doing?
I'm angry.
Oh no! His spinal-brain fluid is leaking!
Midoriya!
The most important thing is
for the body to be able to withstand it.
I'm here!
Weird!
With sweet cotton!
The feeling of speed is completely different.
That's why...
Guys!
I put everything into this thing,
and you just walked by!
All-powerful!
I'm here!
Weird!
With sweet cotton!
I'm here!
He just had some serious problems.
You can't go any faster.
I'm chasing you anyway.
Calm down.
We fought in the NK.
He didn't behave that way.
It all smells too bad.
I don't believe him.
I'm sure Tsukauchi and others made a mistake.
As you know,
Nomu is a genetically modified human body.
Such individuals can withstand a few things.
However,
they are not humans.
They are crazy creatures
with a brain of bones.
Nomu is just a puppet.
They don't have their own will.
Or rather, that's what we thought.
Gran Torino,
we left the lessons for this.
Please, cut it out.
Aizawa!
Calm down.
It's important to tell.
Let's do it right.
For the sake of the right mood.
He is one of the main members of the villainous league.
If we talked to him,
it would be a powerful blow to the league.
Unfortunately,
he doesn't say anything important.
He talks about nothing.
And when it comes to the fact
that it will hurt the league,
he suddenly stops answering
and seems to switch.
And what's the conclusion?
It's a difficult question.
And it took a lot of time to realize.
It turns out that many factors
were involved in creating
one new wonder.
And the factor that is at the core
is related to the person
you knew at the UAE school.
As far as we know,
he died when he was still young.
We found out that his wonder
was similar to the power of Oboro Shirakube.
Once upon a time,
we all tried to become heroes together.
Shota! Hizashi!
Let's create our own agency after the release.
I consider the three of us
to be capable of anything.
And there are three of us.
Even if one makes a mistake,
two others will cover him.
I already said that Shota
is a master at marking small things.
And Hizashi is a master of negotiations.
What do you say?
Let's do it.
There's nothing to add.
That's decided.
Shota!
I haven't agreed yet.
Oh, come on!
Let's do it!
Oboro Shirakube
died during our joint internship.
He was stuck in a falling building.
Suddenly death.
We wanted to establish our agency.
He died shortly after these words.
So...
Kurogiri Nomu
is also highly likely
to be based
on Oboro Shirakube.
We were called
the three idiots of Class A.
I don't understand anything!
Why are we attacking the UAE?
The answer is obvious.
There are many
outstanding secrets there.
It makes sense that
this is our goal.
It's like unnoticeably
looking for pieces
in an immediate restaurant.
Probably
they replaced
Oboro Shirakube's body
before it was cremated.
They made a crazy toy out of it.
Nomu!
Don't try to understand
what's going on, DJ.
There's so much evil left here.
I don't understand!
So far, we've put him to sleep
so that he doesn't take advantage of the miracle.
Why are we here?
Are you hoping for a miracle
because of our old friendship?
Have you watched the movies?
Because of its basis,
it's quite possible.
Do you remember Nomu,
who was overcome by a hard worker in Kyusyo?
According to the reports,
he had his own character.
That creature
interfered with violent people.
DNA analysis showed
that Nomu was created
from the body of Gromila,
who earned a living
by participating in underground battles.
So he saved the remains
of his former personality?
I'm sorry, but I've already fought
Kurogiri in the UAE.
He spoke in a completely different way.
He didn't pay any attention to me.
It could have been a test.
Maybe he was studying
the influence of the changed
or even the erased memories
on the execution of the orders.
I repeat,
there will be a big step forward
if he speaks.
Psyche Mik, wipe your head.
I hope you'll wake up
the former connections of both Shirokuma.
So how do we wake up
the connections of Shirokuma, damn it?
Talk about the old days?
Yes, try it.
What about his family?
If you can't handle it,
we'll invite them here.
Damn it, I'll give it to his parents
to find out about such a nightmare.
He woke up.
Come on.
Come on.
I didn't think we'd meet again.
It's not often that
guests from the UAE come here.
The fog doesn't even come down
from the look of Kurogiri's eyes.
So this is his real face.
Looks like the locals made a mistake.
There's nothing left of Shirokuma in it.
How are things going
with Oshigaraki?
Maybe he was caught?
How do I know?
I see.
Too bad.
Do you think about Oshigaraki?
Yes.
I have to take care of him.
Shit, it's not an obligation.
Damn it, S2, I'll believe
that you have to take care of such a nasty...
It's not hard for me.
I'm not one of those
who rejects someone.
Once
he was a good guy
who bravely took the kitten
I didn't look at on purpose.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Why did you come here?
There's no reaction.
At that time
I was full of contradictory feelings.
I changed my opinion
about everything.
Aizawa Shota, right?
And I'm Shirokuma.
Nice to meet you, Shota.
Shota,
you'll take all the seats in the canteen.
Take my protective glasses.
So your eyes won't get hurt near you.
Now we look alike.
I was like that.
And you always
followed me.
Is this a confession?
Maybe you confused this place
with a church?
You were a joyful optimist,
always moving forward.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Moving forward
without thinking about the consequences.
You didn't realize that
if you die, everything will end.
We
from Yamada are now teachers.
I'm very harsh
with my students.
They say you excluded a lot of them.
Formally, yes.
What?
Did you see the old man's face?
Yes, I saw.
He's always like that.
This time it was worse
when he excluded us.
God, I still have nightmares
about it.
I thought that was it.
On the other hand,
thanks to this, we got better.
Not at all.
You can't make a warning
of exclusion.
Give you the right to exclude
and take back?
Yes. Sacrificing oneself
and selflessness is not the same.
If the youth
confuse the concept,
I will give them death
as they want.
And then I'll take it back
and force them to strive for even greater heights.
Please, give me the rights.
Youi is famous for his free school spirit.
I didn't want
my students to become
like you.
Heroes
who value their lives
for the sake of justice.
I wanted them
to become like you.
Heroes who encourage others.
Because the best heroes
have to live long.
Shirokuma!
If you're still
somewhere there...
Let's become heroes!
All three of us!
Brain activity!
What's wrong with it?
It's messy.
Who creates NOMU?
Where's Shigaraki?
If I take for granted
that Shirokuma's dead body
is in front of me,
then it's for those
who will never
return it
as well as my actions.
Tell me!
Who sent you?
Where did your brain go?
Me?
That day...
You saw me and didn't feel anything?
That day...
I don't know
what you're talking about.
Shirokuma!
Answer me, Shirokuma!
No, I'm...
Kurogiri.
You studied in Class 2A,
Yui School!
We were going to become heroes together!
Theobora Shirokuma!
What are you...
doing?
I'm Kurogiri.
Shigaraki Tomura's defender.
I have no idea
what you're talking about.
Shirokuma!
His activity!
Quiet!
You...
No...
Do your best, Shirokuma!
Shirokuma!
There are three of us.
Even if one of us makes a mistake,
two of the others will cover him.
B-B-Balloon!
What?
I am...
Wipe your head!
Shimmy!
All done.
You've done your job.
Hey...
How are your eyes?
They're completely dry.
A hospital, huh?
I think we're close to something more concrete.
I'm sorry we couldn't help you.
Don't worry about it.
How's Kurogiri?
He's gone deaf, as if he's been switched off.
It doesn't matter, it's a significant progress.
You used to be a student, too, you used to go to your dreams.
And I made you remember the great pain.
I'll make it up to you.
What is it, Nomo?
Why do you have to create this?
I don't hope you'll understand.
It's like wine.
In order to survive the juice, you have to trample the berries.
And I just want to enjoy this taste even more.
I don't know.
All we have to do is not let the victim go.
We'll do what we can.
I hope we've really helped.
We need to get the information out as soon as possible.
The hospital itself doesn't help us, but it could be a starting point.
I see.
Great job.
There's a hooligan in Wakaguma's hospital.
Do you need help?
I'm busy, so I'm going to give up.
What's going on?
They're all talking to me.
About the heroes?
Yeah, I'm their hero number two.
Oh, cool.
It's all bullshit.
I'm going to go buy something to drink.
You want some?
Black coffee.
With milk and sugar.
Okay, okay.
Hospital.
The picture's done.
All that's left is...
A man with a perfect ego and unlimited strength.
The same masterpiece that we all wanted to be.
All for one.
Great job, Tomura Shigaraki.
Everything's going as planned.
Even better than I thought.
Thank you.
Thank you.
The End
In the next episode...
Let's go back two months ago.
Then, before the League of Villains,
one of the guardians of all for one appeared.
The giant Maki.
He was checking if Shigaraki had become a worthy successor.
We, the heroes, are trying to become stronger.
Just like Shigaraki and the other villains.
Next!
My Villain's Academy!
A lesson.
It's a deadly lesson.
Plus Ultra!
