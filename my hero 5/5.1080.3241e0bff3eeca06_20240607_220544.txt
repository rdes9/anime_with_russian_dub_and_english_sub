What did you do here? Now you love me?
It's all right. Love can be controlled.
Let's express it.
I would not have lost Kodo and Kirishima the next time.
I would like to win without losing anyone.
We were wrong.
Wrapped fabric.
I could not apply my knowledge at all.
It's so sad.
If it could be done on the go, you would not have worked.
It took me six years.
And your disappointment will help the development.
Yes.
Those who went to practice are now in thought.
Well, that's logical.
They remember eight vows.
They say that that fight was harsh.
If you go through something like that, then the attitude towards training and motivation will be different.
Compared to this, his unreasonable actions are much wilder.
So, Kirishima, focus on training the skills of close combat.
Yes!
Kodo made the right conclusion.
Work on the accuracy of the animal's instructions.
Get to the point.
Think about the weaknesses of the opponent.
Kaminari, you took it seriously.
Where is the recognition of someone's strength to beat their friends?
Got it.
Asue.
Think about how to fix the mistake, not the mistake itself.
Kiro.
Use today's experience in the future.
You're free.
Got it!
He won, but he saw his inexperience and now it hurts him.
However, he was not upset.
Shinsa is preparing for the next fight, spinning the fight in the head and looking for a way out.
God, he didn't grow up so great.
Well, you know, you lost.
You know why, right?
They made a shishido with a central figure.
They decided to use Shazaki.
If they acted now, they could win.
The look on Vlad's face is terrifying.
Shazaki can't lie.
This factor got you, right?
Shishido.
Monoma.
Because of this, we gave the opponent time to prepare.
Sorry, Shazaki.
The flame of hell burned down.
Well, you at least showed me something good.
I'm really looking forward to our fight.
Hey, Shinso!
Let's think of a way to make the class cry.
Something to shut them up for the belt.
He speaks for himself.
We also need to come up with a plan.
Let's discuss what can be done right now.
Come on, let's do a combo with a powerful finish.
We'll think about the plan too.
There will be a road in the center.
Yeah.
Good idea.
Bakugo, let's think too.
Get out, you freaks.
You will only get in my way.
There you go.
In the fifth fight, we will be against Shinso.
His voice change is dangerous.
Sticky acid flying blow.
What kind of technique is this?
It's easy to hide here.
It will be hard to find the enemy.
I can handle it.
This is mine.
Made by me and for me.
At the right moment, we will use Ida.
First, I will tell you something about my miracle.
Instant kill.
What is this?
If someone is injured, go to the medical center.
People are low creatures.
Don't replace their parts.
Yeah, that's it.
Oh my God.
Oh, this is youth.
Spring in life.
Actually, it's winter now.
The year is coming to an end.
All the guys have worked hard on their miracles.
And the best techniques.
Midori also started to use one for all.
He studied the side style.
And the power of the air.
There was also an exam for the license.
The battle with the vows of death.
The festival.
Deeper than all these events and troubles.
They have been constantly developing.
Now they have the opportunity to compare themselves with others.
To understand their current situation.
This lesson looks like a genius rehearsal.
All-powerful.
What do you say, Shashinsa?
He is good.
Not a fragile dozen.
What he experienced at first.
Disappointment.
Great.
This can be considered an exam.
To transfer to the Heroic Faculty.
Duman is looking forward to the next fight.
Well, Vlad, shall we continue?
If so.
Get ready for the second fight!
Yaoi Rose.
What is it, Kenda?
Why didn't you take part in the beauty contest?
I was sure you would take part.
Aizawa did not warn me that the contest would be held.
And I had a lesson and I still could not come.
Probably Aizawa decided that I did not have to take part.
In practice, we were shooting together in advertising.
In some sense, we were placed in the same category.
Fans throw us in the same pile.
Really?
As when someone likes all the idols inside the same group.
At the festival, the same people were shouting,
Yaoi Rose and Kenda!
Yes.
Ah, that's right.
Idols.
Full stars.
Well, actually ...
Yaoi Rose, you are better than me in magic and ratings.
I don't like it when we are placed in the same row.
In fact, I was waiting for the opportunity to fight as it should be.
From the bottom of my heart, I accept the challenge.
Takayami, you and I are in the same field of berries.
Kuroi Roshihai.
You merge your magic with any darkness and move into it.
Right?
You and I have a common purpose.
Really?
One more lover of philosophy.
Life is an endless darkness.
These guys don't shine at all.
So, both teams are ready.
Then ...
Good luck, Kenda's team!
Let's start the second fight!
Go ahead, passionate comments!
Go ahead!
Well ...
It's a deal!
Yeah!
What role does Kenda play in Class B?
She takes and does what she needs!
How loud!
After all, she is our old lady!
Smart girl, calm and quick-witted.
Also, Kenda is brave when she has to take a risk for herself in the front.
And her joy of life unites our class!
Without her, everyone in Class B would have captured Monomo!
Hey, don't do that!
Senior Sister of Class B!
Here's a girl named Itsuka Kendo!
I wonder if Operation Yaoi Rose will work?
What kind of operation?
Please go to the intelligence, Takayami.
Takayami-san!
I got it.
Dark shadow!
I'm here!
Report when you find the enemy.
I got it!
We are more or less familiar with each other's secrets.
But we have been improving them all this time.
We may not know something.
So first ...
We need to wait and watch!
Dark shadow!
I found the enemy!
Right under that pipe!
Let's go!
We will not wait for anything!
I'll deal with them right away!
Help!
Kura-Ira!
I'm going!
Did you learn to let go of the dark shadow at a great distance?
Did you also become stronger in practice?
How to say?
The further the dark shadow, the less the better.
Everyone back!
Takayami!
What's going on?
Fumikage!
He caught me!
What's wrong with the dark shadow?
Did he break again?
No, not so dark as it was before.
It's not that dark.
It's not that dark.
It's not that dark.
It's not that dark.
It's not that dark.
It's not that dark.
It's not that dark.
No, not so dark that Takayami lost control.
Maybe someone else is controlling him?
Someone from Class B?
Wait!
Hagakure!
Turn on the light!
Now!
When the light breaks, say cheese!
Cheese!
Turn around!
Dark shadow!
Kura-Iro was inside him!
He disappeared!
He merged with the shadows!
So, who is Kura-Iro?
Kura-Iro Shihai from Class B!
The dark magic!
He's able to merge with the shadows!
And when he defeated the magic stronger,
you learned to walk in the shadows!
However, they also have to move!
Takayami Fumikage!
I will overcome you!
We have the same purpose.
I see.
So, we are rivals.
Great!
I'll start with the technique that I created
when I was with Yastri.
The dark fallen angel.
The fallen angel?
Yes.
The dark fallen angel.
He was always doing everything himself.
Not synthetic!
Natural diamonds!
It's easy to get 300 for such a bunch!
Yes, I'll figure it out.
Yastri!
New brakes!
There is a bar with bad customers nearby.
I'm going there now.
So, fill in the papers yourself!
Tsukiyomi!
My friends, we'll deal with him.
Yastri is too fast.
On the other hand, he is the most effective.
I'll go.
Tsukiyomi!
He's a desperate guy.
It was the first time after the sports festival
when Yastri called me.
In practice, I was constantly chasing him,
clearing the places where he figured out the situation.
And questions arose.
You can't sit and wait for the situation to get worse.
Then why did you ask to take me?
We are birds of the same flight.
Is this a game of words?
I'm Yastri.
Is this a game of words?
I'm serious.
20 percent.
I'm here partially for a conversation with a class 1 student.
I would like to discuss those guys from the crime league.
And since you're going,
I decided to take someone who can sing with me.
I chose one of the best at the sports festival.
I stopped at a bird-like place.
You seemed unworthy to me.
First of all, tell me about the attack on ZNK.
Then I told him in more detail about the attack.
With every word, there was an ambush.
I'm not a singer, Naito.
A week of practice went by, and I didn't learn anything.
Hey, tell me how it was in Kyushu.
There...
It was okay.
Later.
He took me to practice again.
During the breaks between these lessons,
something happened to him.
You called me for stories, Yastri.
There's nothing to look at from above.
I'm the third.
Or rather, hero number two.
This Tsukuyomi is crazy.
He's capable of a lot.
Oh!
Great job!
Tsukuyomi, can I have you?
What do you want to talk about this time?
I'm talking about something else.
Yastri!
We've become wind!
Are you flying for the first time?
We're here for 20 percent,
because we're birds of the same flight.
For 50, for the sake of the Oligya stories.
And the last 30 are related to the fact
that it seemed to me that you were wasting yourself in the void.
The sky is great.
Looking from the height of the bird's flight...
Am I wasting myself in the void?
It's good to work on your weaknesses.
But don't forget to develop strong sides.
You can move more freely.
I'm not interested in raising the next generation.
But we're birds of the same flight.
Those who are capable of flying should fly.
There's no need to limit yourself to the ground.
I'll start with a technique that I created
when I was with Yastri.
Dark Pudge Angel.
Dark Pudge Angel?
Or...
Show me!
He's moving in the shadows!
Single attack again.
How unexpected!
I don't think they'll repeat the first fight.
Double deception.
The fact that there are so many corpses here
and you can't find him for them.
Takayami, are you holding on?
Yes.
Takayami Fumikage.
I beat you.
He needs me.
So you think.
Class A.
We have a common purpose.
I set an emotional trap before the start of the fight.
I need Takayami Fumikage.
That's more like it.
And that's not true.
You're an insidious hero.
Now you'll see how I act.
Aoyama!
Insidiousness.
So despicable.
I'm begging you.
Change the meaning of your actions.
With my speed.
In such a crowded, complicated place.
Dark shadow.
Connected to that dump.
It's harder for him to move here.
So they'll never catch me.
So you thought.
Dark shadow.
Dark Pudge Angel.
Is he flying?
Does Takayami have a new technique?
How can he fly?
The principle is very simple.
Dark shadow always soars.
He can move and hold Takayami.
He wraps his cloak so that the light does not hit.
After all, this is his weakness.
And they act at high power.
In this case, Takayami's hands are free.
And the dark shadow flies.
It's so obvious that we didn't think.
And he works with it.
Just like a dove's egg.
Cool.
You're great, Takayami.
However, do not forget to develop
and strong sides.
Thank you.
I will achieve even more.
Rendezvous, Rendezvous.
Plan A failed.
Aoyama.
Laser in the butt.
Takayami, fly as high as possible.
Dark shadow, put on the cloak.
Now.
I will change the shape of the shadow.
Laser in the butt.
Here it is, Hagakure.
I see.
I'll catch it now.
Don't go any further.
That's it, you can't escape.
I didn't think you would attack from the support alone.
However, I personally
expect surprises.
You expect surprises.
Stop!
What, can't you stop?
What?
Are these mushrooms?
I knew it.
After all, Kenda is better than you.
Kenda was right.
If there is a light,
the plan of Kuraira will fail.
Let's move on to Plan B.
I will cover everything around with mushrooms.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
It's good if you sized over here.
Quite a few mushrooms grow at our place,
What will the team do?
Next! Predictions!
Yaoi Rose predicts the course of the fight and creates what is necessary for the victory!
Go beyond the limits, plus Ultra!
