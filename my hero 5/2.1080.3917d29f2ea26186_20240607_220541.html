        <pre>The End
I didn't expect to see you here.
You're from the League of the Villains, aren't you?
They say it was you who killed Snatch.
Snatch? Who's that?
Let's talk, since you've given us such an opportunity.
I'll do my best.
Don't stress out. I can handle it myself.
There are only a few feathers left, but they must be enough.
Come on, guys. I just came to take that gnome.
I have no reason not to beat two of the best wounded heroes in the world.
I saw the news and jumped in.
You're from the League of the Villains, aren't you?
You'll get it now.
Damn, it just got fun.
It's fun.
We'll see each other again, Number One.
I'll give you some time to talk.
And until then, do your best.
Look where you die, Todoroki Enji!
I won't let you go!
It's somehow connected to what happened in Kamino.
Whatever it is, I think it's closed for now.
No.
It's just the beginning.
I want to keep asking endless questions
rather than looking for answers
that won't shake in this dark world.
I want to throw away the armor that I can't see
and protect myself from the wind that blows against my cheeks.
I want to see the sky that Number One pointed out
because I want to see a higher landscape than now.
Burn up your empty, dry heart
and set the future on fire.
Burn up your fantasy.
You told me something else.
What? Really?
We should have talked better, Dabi.
You only have small feathers left.
You can't meet a unarmed soldier.
We had to plan it tomorrow.
At the warehouse on the shore.
And here, right in the center of the city,
looking for someone else.
It's obvious that he's on a completely different level.
You should have warned me in advance.
I changed my mind.
By the way, I warned you about the test of Nomu's work.
You can make the same claims.
You said you would bring someone random.
Number One is not the best.
Did you think about the level?
I thought you'd be happy with such a serious injury, Number One.
I didn't break the promise.
You did it.
It was stupid of me to trust Number Two.
How did it happen that no one died?
I obviously didn't expect that from the man who said he was on our side.
You can't stop me from being considered a hero.
The more I'm trusted, the more useful my information is.
Do you even know how to think in perspective?
I did it exactly because I was thinking about the Dabi League.
Well, whatever.
As long as I don't let you go to the boss.
We'll be in touch, Yastrip.
Let them take you to the League of Villains, Yastrip.
What? Wait, I don't understand anything.
You were gathering a search team with Gran Torino and the like.
Do you know?
That's what we want, Yastrip.
You have sharp eyes and ears.
In the Battle of Kamino, we had to think about the hostages.
We had to hurry.
As a result, we didn't have enough intelligence data, and we didn't know everything about the enemy.
To eradicate this organization, we need more information.
Especially about those creatures.
Can they be done with one force alone?
If we don't find out about the League as soon as possible,
we'll continue to make the same mistakes.
So while I'm with them,
do I have to close my eyes to all evil?
We turned to you because you can do it.
You don't care about prestige and fame.
You can think in perspective.
We think you're the best fit for this.
Old man.
I'm sorry.
I...
Ah, I remembered this Snatch.
Did you even think about the feelings of those you left behind?
I thought so much that I went crazy.
That's great.
You were lying there for only two days.
It's good that you managed to save your left eye.
It's my fault.
I'm very sorry.
How arrogant.
I'm responsible for my own injury.
Can I say that too when I'm hurt?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Can I say that too when I'm hurt?
There's something more important.
Listen, that nomad came right after us.
He showed up and let us come.
Do you think it was an accident?
Well, two of the best heroes attract attention.
Maybe the enemy wanted to split up with us?
How sad.
I had to do such a thing to have this excuse now.
By the way, it's quite possible that the rumors about Nomo themselves are a bait for the heroes.
Let's get in touch with the search squad.
Be careful.
If you continue to investigate the case,
then find someone to help with the threat of such a level.
You don't care about such things, do you?
I'll beat you up, you freak.
I'll come back to work as soon as the wings grow.
In a couple of days.
Caretaker, will you take a vacation?
Maybe.
See you then.
Is this really necessary?
It's a request.
We believe that the League will not be able to escape if it acts from the inside and from the outside.
They think so.
You say it's a request, knowing that I can't refuse.
How ugly.
Yes, ugly, Yastrip.
Fortunately, you couldn't get to Kamino.
A child?
Did you save everyone there?
So you don't believe in that terrible accident?
Please find that child.
Now!
He has a natural gift.
He needs to become a hero.
Please allow us to help your entire family.
Cities of Secret Investigation.
If a dirty maid helps others live calmly, I will do it with joy.
I'm Yastrip.
A too fast person.
One day I will definitely fall into a world where the heroes have too much time.
I'm going there at full speed.
Welcome back.
We haven't seen each other for a long time.
Why did you let me go for this?
I asked Aizawa to come too, but he refused.
In general, let's celebrate your successful and serious task.
You have a terrible scar.
Guys, you promised to celebrate today.
Dad will finally try to think of a family and all that.
At least don't show hatred.
I actually hear everything.
Sorry, sister, I can't do that.
To the father!
To the father.
If you want to say something, say it.
Say?
Well, you give.
Actually, I only found out today that Shota loves Sobo.
You didn't want him to talk to us.
Shota, don't look there.
They live in a completely different world.
Mom and sister are suddenly ready to forgive you for some reason.
And for me, you're still a mess.
It seems that you have changed.
But no, you deny us.
You became number one, defeated a strong enemy.
But I didn't forget anything.
I remember Mom's screams.
Shota's tears.
And what happened to our brother Toya.
You changed your views yourself.
And what are you doing only on your side?
It's disgusting.
From now on, I will buy wine with you.
That's it?
Sorry, sister, and thank you for the food.
To the father!
Damn it.
I knew nothing would come out.
Shota started seeing Mom.
Dad went to make compromises.
Mom started smiling.
I thought we could be a family again.
I was so happy to hear that, Shota!
Shota!
Sister.
It's the first time I've seen such an emotional nation.
Two days have passed.
Opinions on hero number one continue to change.
I wonder how he is.
He was covered in blood.
And the villains ran away again?
They've already caught a bunch of them.
Is it so difficult for him to deal with such a villain?
We hear anxious reviews.
Turn it off!
No.
Understand, he is now risking himself to save us!
Look!
I was a fan of the sharp shooter.
Now I'm a fan of him!
I'm a fireman myself.
So I'm very happy.
Remember that guy who said, look?
What kind of guy?
This boy was called, look.
That shout made many get involved in the effort.
This boy?
I hear.
I hear something invisible die.
It's obvious that you created it with your own hands.
That hero was very cool.
Yes, he's cool.
But I agree with the words of the father.
I can't forgive you for what you did to mom yet.
Therefore, as the head of the family,
I want to see what will happen next.
I know how small things can change people.
I became number one, not as I wanted.
I worked as a hero with shame and frustration in my soul.
What is this power for?
Why do you have to be strong?
Effort.
Confident answer.
Incredibly simple.
When he said that,
I had a simple feeling in my head.
I thought that I would provide them with a future.
If this is the task of the best,
then where is my future?
It's too late to ask for forgiveness now.
Dad, where are you going?
Fuyumi.
Forgive me for everything.
I shouldn't have said that to my father.
It's too late, but I have to buy back the wine and return the future.
On that day,
first there were regular trainings,
then work with one for all.
I fell asleep without even taking a shower.
I had a dream.
Next to me was a beautiful woman with a harsh expression on her face,
and behind her were strangers.
I had already seen this dream.
No.
I understood something bigger.
This is from the voice of one for all.
I can't believe it.
I can move with my right hand.
But no.
There are two more behind.
One develops strength,
transmits it to the other.
Who also continues to develop it and transmits it further.
This is the accumulated strength that connects the voices of those who are praying for help
and from the hearts of the brave.
Seven people, eight consider me.
All of us are successors, one for all.
I am the eighth,
and the last.
Come with me.
No.
Come with me.
My dear, stupid younger brother,
why do you resist?
This voice,
I will never forget it.
All for one.
Because you are wrong.
I won't let you do what you want, older brother.
Younger?
Older?
So this is the first?
What cruel words.
I'm trying to compromise.
What, patience is no longer part of your concept of justice?
Now the whole world is plunged into chaos.
And these forces are not for their own good.
And you only think about your own pleasure.
I didn't notice at all.
Is this an event of the past?
Come on.
His jaw has changed.
It looks like his fangs will grow forever.
He is a kind man,
who took care of his elderly parents.
However, he was persecuted.
He was called a monster, a patient.
Even his own parents keep away from him.
And he has no strength.
One evening on the way to work,
he was attacked by those who had it.
His electric shocker turned out to be useless.
He was trapped.
He was caught in a trap.
His hair looks like a syringe.
Don't!
There is no way back!
Please.
Hurry!
If something happens, will you help me?
Of course.
Oh, mom, dad.
Me too.
I will not forget my duty.
What kind of world are you talking about, younger brother?
I see people and help them with my strength.
Of course.
You just added two servants to your collection.
I need reliable people.
If you deny me and my actions,
then you deny their happiness.
This world has lost its human form.
And I will bring order to it with my own strength.
So who of us really thinks only about themselves?
And what kind of order is that if you use others?
You don't even remember how many people.
They used it and threw it away.
I will not allow him to be insulted.
Oh, it's easier with him.
My brother is so fragile.
Poor thing.
He was born without a reason.
And without strength, there is no agreement with anyone.
However, despite this, I love you,
poor little brother.
You are my whole family.
I can give you anything.
You just need to help me.
A choice for those who have no strength,
mercy for those who sin.
You didn't eat anything again.
It hurts to look at your sight.
I will not be the one you want me to see.
You know, they used their strength so aimlessly.
They created groups,
interfered with me,
disobeyed the order.
Therefore, they were killed.
I did not give any orders.
My numerous friends love me
and did what I wanted.
How happy I am.
I just wanted something, and they did it.
It's a dream.
Like the world from the comic book we read back then.
You only read the third volume.
You don't know the rest.
The world was ruled by the king of demons,
and the hero of justice suffered torture
and finally saved this world.
Brother, did you know
that bad guys always lose in the final?
Dreams have become reality.
In reality, these rules do not work.
In this reality, you have not conquered me.
Nothing, I will redo it.
After all, you are so dear to me.
Stop it!
I found a force that can even handle your visible body.
I use it together.
No!
You are the eighth, right?
I wanted to show more.
But you barely got to 20%.
Be careful.
We have passed the point of singularity.
But don't be afraid.
After all, you are not alone.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
It's okay.
I hate words.
Suddenly I mutter.
I can't say anything.
I want to believe in the dark sky.
The longing is not for killing yourself.
I have to say goodbye.
Goodbye!
I can't say anything.
I want to believe in the dark sky.
The longing is not for killing yourself.
I have to say goodbye.
Goodbye!
I have to say goodbye.
I have to say goodbye.
I have to say goodbye.
Goodbye!
I have to say goodbye.
In the next episode...
I'm scared of changes. I have one for everyone.
However, I'm going to the combat training.
This is a fight between classes A and B.
I can handle one for everyone.
I will definitely get the upper hand.
Next!
A-B clash!
What?
We will have a special participant?
Yes!
We will have a special participant?
Yes!
We will have a special participant?
Will there be a special participant?
Is that you?
Go beyond!
Plus Ultra!
