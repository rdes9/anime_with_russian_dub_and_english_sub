At the beginning of the year, Todoroki invited us and Kacchan to do an internship at the Worker's Agency.
There we were.
It was worth it for us to arrive on the spot as soon as we realized the amazing power of hero number one.
In the UAE, it's hard work, but here you'll get experience.
Get as much experience as you can.
What do you want to work on?
Get used to the experience.
I'm waiting for you to be able to catch the villain at least once by the end of the winter, faster than me.
If I follow the Worker and reduce the distance between us a little,
then one day I will achieve the goal of becoming the greatest hero.
Let's go!
Let's go!
It's been a week of internship at the most outstanding agency in modern Japan.
Thief! Call the hero!
In the world of professionals, where every action is connected to the amount of damage, we just kept chasing the Worker.
Learn to do what you have problems with, even in your dreams.
So decide what to do. You have to be in the process.
We saw the thief for the first time.
Damn it, he got away from us again.
After all, he's incredible.
As soon as we get closer, he breaks away even further.
Still use the cash.
Be careful.
Yes!
Worker!
We have a runaway from the crime scene.
I'm going!
Damn it!
Let's go!
Yeah!
Thank you for your help.
You go on.
That's enough for today.
Go back to your room and rest.
I'm not tired yet!
Kachan!
And you won't go yourself?
First, I'll make a detour.
It's too early to get up tomorrow.
You need to be rested.
I'm tired.
I'm tired.
I'm tired.
I'm tired.
No matter how powerful the power is,
the essence is to accumulate it gradually.
Although you are doing the same,
but the school and working experience are different.
Take the school knowledge
and let the body use it here in the best conditions.
I don't think I'll catch up with him soon.
Come on.
But still, I'm not giving up.
Little by little. Step by step.
Great job, old man!
I'm going to have a rest. Call me if you need me.
Yes, sir!
The enemy is an army of liberation.
There are already more than 100,000 of them.
Hello, dad, is that you?
I found out that you are now working with Shota.
Fuyumi?
And he even came with his friends. Why didn't you tell me?
I would have known how much I was surprised when I found out.
By the way, I'm going back to school soon.
Then it will be harder for us to spend time, and tomorrow is Saturday.
So bring everyone to us.
I'll have a lot of fun over dinner.
What can I give my family after all the pain that I caused?
I think about it every night.
I started to dream the same dream.
It seems as if my wife and children are having fun over dinner.
They laugh at their stupidity.
They enjoy it.
They are filled with happiness.
But I'm not behind this table.
I know why.
I know the pain.
They live in a completely different world.
Get up!
If you fight like this, you will not defeat the Almighty.
And the pitiful villains too.
Stop! He's only five years old!
Five years old! Don't interfere!
It's your fault.
It's because of you, Mom!
What? You have nothing else to say?
I will win, and I will become better only with the help of Mom.
And I won't even fight with your help.
Did Shota go to the hospital with Ray?
Well, yes.
And what about her?
Mom agreed to meet with him.
They talked a little.
So Ray Shota...
He decided that if he was too busy at school, he would try to write to her.
Shota really tries to cope with the past.
I'm sure one day our whole family will be together.
Actually, I just found out today that Shota loves Sobo.
You didn't want him to talk to us, did you?
Mom and sister are ready to forgive you for some reason.
And for me, you're still a busy goat.
It seems that you have changed, but no.
You deny us.
You became number one, overcome a strong enemy.
But I haven't forgotten anything.
I remember Mom's screams, Shota's tears, and what happened to our brother Toyo.
Toyo, you've changed your views.
And you're doing something only from your side.
It's disgusting.
Shota started seeing Mom.
Dad made a compromise.
Mom started smiling.
I thought that we could be a family again.
The hero and the hard worker were very cool.
Yes, he's cool, but...
I agree with my father's words.
I can't forgive you for what you did to our mom.
Therefore, as the head of the family, I want to see what will happen next.
I know how small things can change people.
Former hero number one.
And what is the symbol of the world now?
To be honest, I don't know what to answer.
Personally, I believed that the country needed such a symbol.
And I carried it forward with all my feet.
I needed a color that marked hope or warning.
I swore that it would be them.
And I ended up here.
Hard worker, I understand your position.
And I know what you were told.
Many people compare us.
But in fact, we are different.
Don't become the symbol I want to be.
You shouldn't rush to find a way that suits you.
What's the point of being strong?
Hard worker, I'm sure the answer is extremely simple.
Hard worker, we have a problem!
I speak! All partners, follow me!
Hard worker
There are many places in the hard worker's agency where you can stay.
That's why we lived, ate and slept together with our flaming partners.
Good morning! Good morning! How are you?
Good morning, burning!
Why are you yelling so early in the morning?
Well, how do you like the attempts to catch the enemy before the hard worker?
Oh, I'm sorry I brought up the sick topic.
We partners know how difficult it is.
Good morning, burning.
Good morning, what is it?
Meduria, Bakuga.
Yesterday we almost succeeded.
Remember what you felt then.
Today we will surpass the hard worker.
It's only me who almost succeeded, idiot!
And you both are slow! I'm better than you!
I have not mastered the exact blows.
And I see that you are slowly getting used to them.
Well, yes.
Listen here!
Problems in accumulation before liberation, right?
It is not possible to quickly gain maximum power and immediately release it.
Idiots! You will always be in reserve!
I understand. I don't even need to burn anything.
Let's go!
Follow me!
Not enough!
This is not enough!
Think, act, control with force!
Everything needs to be done much faster!
Do not lose a minute, not a second!
Prevent the event!
To do this, you need to be observant.
Every day, look out for the hidden evil.
Do not follow people, but everything that happens.
In one day, you will not master such things.
However, as you gain experience, you will become more attentive.
Run!
Run!
Run!
Run!
Run!
Run!
Show that you will surpass yourself!
The absence of changes is all the same as a step back.
Heroes must constantly develop!
Today we failed to surpass him again.
How annoying!
Nevertheless, we are clearly moving faster than on the first day.
So bring everyone to us.
I came to use you.
I'm sorry that I'm here for convenience.
And I have nothing to grumble about with my parents in front of my friends.
Fuyumi, you helped me a lot.
Let's go!
Yes!
What?
My sister invited us to dinner.
What is it?
Well, she wanted to see my friends.
I knew that you lied to her!
Now tell everyone that we are not friends!
Kachan!
Hello!
Thank you!
Hello!
Thank you for finding the time.
I know that you are very busy.
I'm glad to see you.
Feel at home.
I'm Fuyumi, the elder sister.
Thank you for getting distracted and decided to take us home.
I'm Todoroki's classmate.
Izuku Midoriya!
I know!
I saw your boy shot on TV at the sports festival.
Oh, I'm sorry I hurt your brother then.
I didn't want it to turn out like this.
It's okay, it was a fight.
What the hell!
I'm sorry I called you all of a sudden.
And thank you for coming.
We're just happy.
You don't often visit your friend's house.
Is your father here too?
I saw his shoes.
I wanted the whole family to talk to you.
Now let's get to know each other again.
I'm Fuyumi, the elder Shota.
I'm the teacher of the elementary classes.
This is his elder brother, Natsu.
He's a student.
Hello.
Shota, will you introduce us to your friends?
Yes.
These are my classmates, Midoriya and Bakuga.
Nice to meet you!
Let's eat before it gets cold.
If you don't like something, don't bother.
Just don't eat it.
Okay, bon appetit.
Bon appetit.
Bon appetit.
It's very tasty.
Fried chicken is just a treat.
I'm so happy.
You can see that it's perfectly marinated.
And on the outside, there's a crispy crust.
Which is carefully...
Stop whining at the table!
You've already spoiled my appetite.
Here you go!
I can't believe there's so much meat juice in here!
What else can you do?
The housekeeper hurt her back and left.
Since then, she's been cooking only for her sister.
There you go!
Natsu, you've been cooking too!
We've changed!
So, I ate your food?
I don't even know.
There's always a lot of seasoning in mine.
I'm sure the laborer stopped you and told you not to eat that.
I didn't realize.
What is it?
What do you usually eat at school?
Food from the canteen.
Let's have Natsu next time.
Thank you for the food.
I'm here.
That's enough.
Natsu!
I'm sorry, sister.
I still can't.
Excuse me.
Where should I put the plates?
Okay.
Listen, Kachan.
You knew there were so many roads in the family.
What?
I didn't know that.
I didn't know that.
I didn't know that.
I didn't know that.
I didn't know that.
I didn't know that.
I didn't know that.
What's going on in this family?
What?
You guys were shouting out that I heard everything.
You heard.
I'm ashamed that I made Midoriya and Bakugo clean up.
It would be worse if you didn't let me help.
I will not say that I never felt the same as Natsu.
It's just that we've got a chance.
Shota, what do you think about Dad?
I think I got this scar because of him.
Oh my God, Shota! I'm sorry, Shota!
What have I done? Someone help me!
Mom was patient until her patience burst.
He broke it. It's so hard to forgive.
Although, now Mom is trying to cope with it herself.
Dear Shota, I hope you're all right.
It's getting cold. I'm worried you'll catch a cold.
Lately, I've been going out more often.
The doctors say if it goes on like this, I'll be discharged soon.
I want to live with you again, Natsu and Fuyumi.
I'll do everything in my power to keep this from happening again.
So far, I don't know what I want to do.
I still don't know what to think about Dad.
Hey, you! You invited us over!
There's nothing to discuss in person!
The plates aren't washed yet!
Oh, I'm sorry. It was an accident.
Well, we heard that there was a traffic jam.
Usually, an invitation to dinner is a good thing.
Damn, we've ruined the whole Tsuchansky map.
I'm sorry we heard that.
Todoroki, I think you're getting closer to forgiving him every day.
If you really hate Dad, then don't say goodbye.
I think it's okay.
But you're such a kind person.
I think you're just waiting.
You're probably in that stage right now.
What can I give to my family after all the pain I've caused?
I'm starting to dream the same dream.
It feels like my wife and children are having fun at dinner.
I'm so sorry that you're not there.
I'm sorry that you're not there.
I'm so sorry that you're not there.
I am.
I'm so sorry that you're not there.
I'm so sorry that you're not there.
I'm so sorry that you're not there.
I'm so sorry that you're not there.
I'm so sorry that you're not there.
I'm so sorry that you're not there.
I'm so sorry that you're not there.
I'm so sorry that you're not there.
I'm so sorry that you're not there.
I'm so sorry that you're not there.
I'm so sorry that you're not there.
I'm so sorry that you're not there.
I'm so sorry that you're not there.
I'm so sorry that you're not there.
I'm so sorry that you're not there.
I'm so sorry that you're not there.
I'm so sorry that you're not there.
I'm so sorry that you're not there.
I'm sorry that you're not there.
I'm sorry that you're not there.
I'm so sorry.
In the next episode!
Kachan and I found out how hard the hard worker wants to get along with his family.
However, as if for a laugh, the villains, offended by the hard worker, got into a fight.
Let's go, Todoroki!
Kachan! The enemies will not get what they want!
Next! Unforgivable!
Let's go, Todoroki!
Kachan! The enemies will not get what they want!
Let's go, Todoroki!

Kachan! The enemies will not get what they want!
