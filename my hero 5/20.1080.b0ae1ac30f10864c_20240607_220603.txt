Great, Shigaraki Tomura. Everything is going as it should. Even better than I thought.
Shigaraki Tomura, we all lost for one thing and now we are very weak.
To achieve something great, we need to reach a new level.
He left us for this power.
Give the order, then I will go and get this power for us.
I was looking for it and finally found it.
So it's you, the one and only heir.
Shigaraki Tomura, we all lost for one thing and now we are very weak.
Give the order, then I will go and get this power for us.
The one and only heir.
Shigaraki Tomura.
Shigaraki Tomura, we all lost for one thing and now we are very weak.
Shigaraki Tomura, we all lost for one thing and now we are very weak.
Shigaraki Tomura, we all lost for one thing and now we are very weak.
Shigaraki Tomura
Shigaraki Tomura
Is this the power that left us all for one thing, Kuragiri?
Why is everyone for one thing? I can't do that!
For what, master? He's too weak!
Looks like you have some trouble, Shigaraki.
Doctor...
How are you feeling?
I'm fine, but I can turn into a head.
No! You can't do that!
I can't accept this guy!
In front of you is the giant mahi.
He used to be a bodyguard for everyone.
The giant mahi is incredibly tough and is able to withstand several challenges without any improvements.
Everyone was hiding him for one thing.
In the fear that the Almighty will one day weaken and overcome him,
the fundamental work was revealed a couple of years after your arrival.
Thanks to his dream and willpower, he continued despite what happened to him.
I think he doesn't really look like a pleasant gift.
And you are careful, Dabi.
The giant mahi is so loyal that he is now in despair.
He is torn apart between the former master and Shigaraki.
Do we have to work hard to bring him back?
That didn't help, Dabi!
Mahi...
Mahi...
Mahi...
This is the recording of the voice of everyone for one thing.
Did he make up his mind there?
I don't think so.
Really?
Do you still think you'll get everything you want?
You've been in Kurogiri for too long.
Come to your senses.
Doctor, what kind of relationship is this?
Wait a minute.
Everything is ready.
What is it?
The old man is talking nonsense.
Din, come on, don't be silly, it's disgusting.
What is it?
Everyone used this stone for one thing.
Where did it come from?
I don't understand anything else.
And now let's talk.
Darn it!
Where are we?
What is this?
Nomu?
They're a little different.
It's not for nothing that I said you were attentive.
You're right, they're different.
These kids are really different.
They're advanced.
Super Nomu, which is the closest to the masterpiece.
I was just looking for you for some reason.
I need a second copy of something.
How's your hair growing, Shigaraki?
Is everything okay with your father?
What?
Yeah.
I didn't want to reveal my location,
so I brought you here by teleport.
Like the giant mahi,
I was a close assistant to everyone for one thing.
My name is Daruma Ujjika.
I just came up with the name.
So, Shigaraki, I brought you here
in connection with the compromise
on which I went for everyone for one thing.
My life, abilities, and these kids
are completely dedicated to the great everyone for one thing.
You relied on small pieces of everything.
Not because I don't like you,
but for my own good.
I want to make sure
that you deserve my full self-sacrifice.
What can a 20-year-old champion of society
who hasn't achieved anything yet show me?
Huh, Shigaraki Tomura?
Don't, Tenko!
I don't really remember
who I was before I met you and the teacher.
Yeah, I know.
And at the same time,
when I put them all on,
I'm filled with rage.
I've been thinking about it for a long time.
Since that very day.
What?
No one helps, huh?
It's a shame, isn't it?
Shimura Tenko.
I see you're scared.
You're in pain.
You probably ran away to find help.
It's so terrible.
The hero will help.
Sooner or later, the hero.
That's what they all think and pretend
that they don't see you.
You turned our world into such a place.
Now everything will be fine.
After all, I'm with you.
My memories begin with the teacher's embrace.
And until then, I was empty.
I'm sorry it's so cramped here,
but now this is your room.
From now on, I will be your teacher.
A teacher?
What are you going to teach me?
A doctor.
Yes, I'll bring it.
That's all that's left of your family.
You're a kind of mutation.
No one knew about the existence of such a miracle,
and you've broken through your whole family on her nerves.
Do you remember?
At that moment, my mind was filled with scattered pictures.
I felt a disgusting, unclear irritation.
Will you take care of them?
No, maybe you won't remember everything,
but in your soul, those feelings are clearly alive.
I want to teach you how to direct these feelings,
including this irritation.
When I put them on, it's so strange.
My head becomes terribly dizzy,
but at the same time, my heart calms down in its own way.
It's strange, isn't it?
You only have those scattered pictures in me.
At the same time, a heavy threat is drowning in my mind.
From there, the anger erupts endlessly.
I never have peace.
Even if the society of heroes fell,
even if I ruled the shadows,
this heaviness wouldn't go anywhere.
Yes.
Apparently, I have to hate everything.
Everything that breathes is wildly irritating me.
So let everything collapse,
then you will see the most beautiful horizon on the entire planet.
Help me, doctor.
I'll show you everything, from heaven to hell.
Well, you've set up the air castles.
I'm not going to take it from them yet.
Why not?
I'll help you, Shigaraki Tomura.
I'll try.
Villains.
Just those who make up all kinds of nonsense in life.
I didn't know you thought about such dangerous things.
No.
And what I like, you will also destroy.
I take into account the desire of my comrades.
Live as you want.
Hooray!
You're even worse than I thought, Shigaraki.
You freak.
Are you trying to get on my nerves?
I was going to work with you from the very beginning.
I prepared some strength for you.
However, I will not give it to you now.
Your guys are too weak.
First, reach a minimum possible level.
That guy is pretty simple.
And unlike me, he denies you with all his heart.
Go and try to fix yourself a giant mahi.
Then I will be ready to devote myself to you.
If you need it, do it yourself.
Yes, we have a very long consultation.
I will not help.
It's just that your flame does not work on him.
Go away, psycho.
I just want to go now and bring us a good ally.
Go?
Come on.
I count on you.
Then let Dabi help me with the tests of the front.
Besides, they have a similar aesthetic taste.
They will work.
Did you hear me at all?
Then bring us back.
I suddenly lit up.
Now you will use this to communicate with me.
Come on, little John.
Send the guys to the giant mahi.
Oh, master.
Hi.
Your future king is back.
Weakling.
There is only a chance in the air.
Weaklings.
The future king is in trouble.
We have nothing new.
For Dr. Ujjik to cooperate with us,
we need to somehow pacify the giant mahi.
It's been a month and a half,
and the giant mahi is still against Shigaraki.
He constantly attacks for 48 hours and 40 minutes.
Then he falls back for about three hours
and starts the fight again.
His body grows during the fight.
And the giant mahi always finds Shigaraki,
wherever he is.
In these months, the giant mahi has been fighting
and Shigaraki has not slept well.
His life is in the hands of a huge creature,
and for some reason he smiles.
If we ran away from the battlefield,
he would not chase us for a long time.
After all, his only goal is the heir to the master, Shigaraki.
Therefore, everyone, except Shigaraki,
has a break.
We dedicated ourselves to the victory over the beast.
The doctor provided me with minimal funding.
For that money, I went and bought myself a special jacket.
It's convenient.
When I'm cold, I move slowly.
Well...
I love the trapezoid silhouette.
You're here because you love Stein.
And don't point to the fact that he's still in the league.
So why did you stay?
I love Stein.
I love the tongue.
I love the eye.
I love that I can love so many people.
What freedom!
Finally he fell asleep.
Does this creature ever eat?
Is the tomur alive?
Yes, he barely moves.
I think I'm closer to the goal.
I swear, it's a huge slope in front of me.
It looks like a young man chasing his dream.
Oh, it's Giron.
I called him so many times, but he never picked up the phone.
Ask him about the insurance.
He's worried about me,
although he's already introduced me to the League of Villains.
He's so good.
Hey, why don't you answer the phone?
Mr. Compress, huh?
Well, you're a creature.
Well, it's because of us.
And he's not to blame for anything.
You are Din Bubaygavora.
The villain's name is Weiss, right?
The voice mask?
Who is it? Where's Giron?
Can you turn on the news now?
Urgent news.
As yesterday, another finger was found today.
Finger?
Previous ones were found in the house of the head of the group of villains of the 8th covenant of death.
In the Khosu airport.
At the Tuyo highway.
And in the epicenter in the Kamino district.
A new finger was found in the center of Fukuoka.
These are all the places where we visited with you.
Who the hell are you?
I am the supreme leader of the liberation army.
Red Estro.
First Yakutza,
now the liberation army.
This is some kind of retro boom.
They say you sold a lot of books.
You shouldn't be investigating this interference.
On the contrary, we started the interference.
What about Giron?
And what do you need?
He's a great guy.
Well, your man is here.
Alive, of course.
We want to free the superpowers,
lower the current cost,
and set up a world in their place,
where people will be people,
and the abilities will be used 100%.
But this is not in line with our goals.
Yakutza again wants to cover up our name,
Let the agent go and call back later.
We are very busy right now.
When we sort it out here,
I will listen to you.
A circle of rebels.
Well, then, rest and listen.
First of all, I will not let him go.
Now he is a hostage.
I heard you are all very united there,
and the guy deserves respect.
Such a strong labor discipline.
I will not let him go.
I will not let him go.
I will not let him go.
He is a strong labor discipline.
He must have been hiding in the dark,
taking into account the all-seeing eye of the heroes and the police.
That's why he was persecuted
from the same dark.
It is worth praising him.
After all, he managed to get rid of the client list.
He did not give anything away,
did not hand over a single stone,
even when his fingers were cut off.
And then we restored the deleted data.
We will praise him
for his defensive resistance.
We, the soldiers of the liberation army,
were preparing for the coming day.
We have endured generations.
We have endured.
Let the roots prepare.
A circle of rebels?
I don't like such jokes.
There are 160,560 soldiers
all over the country.
We are ready to make our move.
Are you kidding me?
You are not gata, are you?
It looks like you are.
Too late.
We have already brought a satellite camera to you.
No matter where you go, we will find out.
We will find you,
wicked villains.
Remember about Staratele,
Yastrebe,
in a sharp arrow,
Murica,
and Coria.
If we tell them about you,
they will rush.
How nice that you warned.
What do you need?
Destro should command the liberation army.
You guys
have managed to get famous.
We will crush you
and thus declare
the revival of the liberation army.
The fingers were only sworn.
We do not need
all sorts of pitiful negotiations.
Very soon we will start
the battle for the liberation
of the superhuman.
Come to Aichi,
in an hour.
Then I will let Giron go,
and then you have to choose.
You will fight us and fall,
or you will be caught by the heroes
and you will fall.
Decide, Shigaraki Tomura.
Do we have to get to Aichi in an hour?
He has his own satellite camera.
Yes, it's terrible.
We were made.
What to think about here?
Nothing. The scarf looks like guts and round glasses.
Only he has such a bad taste.
Thanks to Giron,
I found my place.
We need to save him now.
He could have been killed.
All this could have been a lie.
After all, he was the only one who talked.
If there is at least some chance,
you have to go.
Without thinking about the weather,
go away.
Since when are you so involved in friends?
I'm a virgin.
I came up with something.
Doctor, are you listening?
Yes.
I did not know that the army of liberation
is still somewhere around.
I see you really made the darkness angry.
I am upset.
How long until we wake up the healthy man?
If everything is as usual,
then two hours and thirty-five minutes.
Doctor,
where is Dabi?
Well, now he is
on the border of Mio and Shiga.
Great place.
We need a transfer.
Let's go.
So let's go?
What if they are real?
The giant of magic is invincible.
I've been fighting him for a month
and I know it.
He lost a lot of health points.
Wherever I am,
the giant of magic will find me
and come.
I will leave this gromila
for those 100,000 people
and let them fight.
Even such a big guy like him
will get tired after this.
You are so cunning.
What will you do if you are caught?
There will be one dead fool.
You will go anyway.
I said so.
That's it, now I'm alone.
I will wipe them out.
To be continued...
To be continued...
To be continued...
To be continued...
Their Supreme Commander Redestra is going to destroy the League of Criminals and create a new society.
Together with 110,000 soldiers, he's starting an exuberant party.
Next, it's Rebirth Day.
Evil will fight against evil.
Go beyond, plus Ultra!
