        <pre>Get ready, Class A! Today we're going to decide who's stronger!
Heroic faculty of U.A.
Classes 1A and 1B go through joint combat training.
In the first fight, Class A's team won.
In the second fight, a collision of Kendo's planning and analysis of the condition made by Yao and Rose happened.
Barely, but Class B won.
And in the end, we have one victory and one defeat.
Class A won.
Class B lost.
Class A lost.

Don't do this,
ok?
They can't be stronger without practice?
This time the damage is serious, not like in the first round.
So is the training on the hero's faculty.
Although I think it was already too much.
Fukidashi! Kendo!
You know, but let me remind you to limit the destruction.
Yes, I'm sorry.
Vlad, when the mushroom mushrooms disappear,
in about two hours,
then the place will have to be changed.
While we take a break.
In the second fight, the class B won without a word.
Just like at the school festival.
As a result, the victory will be for class B.
But you don't get upset, class A.
The difference in our abilities has become obvious.
That's all.
I'm sorry.
He will always behave like that, right?
Why does he do this every time, knowing that he will be hit?
It turns out that there are a lot of monsters in class B.
However, just like in class A.
Fukidashi, I didn't know you could do that.
Because that's where the voice comes from.
I had to put up with it a little.
Obviously, it's not just about their miracles.
All the guys have grown morally, and this has strengthened their abilities.
You write so much.
You grew up on your own.
I hope so.
But far from as strong as I am.
And where did you grow up?
Actually, I didn't talk about growth.
I also came quietly.
All-powerful?
Midoriya, my boy, come here.
Okay.
They are so close.
In recent times, Midoriya has been hanging out with the All-powerful all the time.
They say he has been helping with the training since the school festival.
Of course, the All-powerful knows everything about what's going on with Midoriya.
I just heard it from someone.
Oh, sorry.
Don't turn the spell on the fight.
You shouldn't have wasted your strength.
Tell me, have you still not felt anything strange in your spell?
No, nothing like that.
I see.
My teacher didn't say anything about the sudden activation of the spell, so...
I thought I'd discuss it with the All-powerful.
Yeah, that would be great.
But be careful.
In the fifth fight,
you will be Shinsou, who launched the remains one for all.
Yeah, I'll be careful.
Hey!
You scared me!
You asked me not to tell you about your business,
and you're leaving so suspiciously.
Obviously, you have nowhere to go.
Let's do it without this.
Something happened with one for all?
Well, in general...
It worked out all of a sudden.
I don't even know if it's a step forward or a step back.
I don't know either.
How long are you going to support him, huh?
I've actually gotten stronger since our last fight.
I'm trying my best.
Bakugan is taking care of his own kid.
What are you laughing at?
You're pissing me off!
Come on, stop it, you bastard!
Or not.
Midori saw those who own one for all,
and now he's going to kill Shinsou,
who caused it.
It seems everything is connected.
Teacher,
what are you trying to do with the other predecessors?
I think your injuries will be healed in about 20-30 minutes.
Say thank you to your body,
which heals so quickly.
And the skin is so tender.
The third fight will pass.
Here, but in two eastern areas
than the previous fight.
Great, let's continue.
Get ready for the third fight.
Finally, it's Tide's turn.
With him, Todoroki, who hits with fire and ice.
Add to it the speed of Tide,
the unsurpassed scouting of Shoji,
and the skills of the close fight of Ojiro.
A great team with an ideal balance.
There Todoroki!
The victory is theirs!
You shouldn't underestimate the others.
I know without you!
Todoroki,
are you Kayami?
Has your throat already passed?
I took the prescribed medicine.
Everything is fine.
I see.
I was embarrassed at the fight,
so I rely on you.
And why on me?
I'm a stripper and a hard worker.
You and I were teachers
in the last fight.
We must keep the reputation
number two and number one.
Yes.
In the last fight.
Plus Ultra!
Full
of
fumes!
Shoji,
you just have to learn
this technique.
Don't turn away.
Don't dare to run away from yourself.
Get up.
Don't play the weak.
Your
was so close.
He had more firepower.
But with him was
Rain.
He was so close to
himself.
And you, Shota!
You are finally
the one who will implement this technique!
You will achieve
what I wanted!
Todoroki!
Todoroki!
Are you okay?
You look thoughtful.
Really?
Yeah.
What are you worried about?
I'm fine.
Thank you.
Todoroki's face is always the same.
And you noticed the changes.
As an elder, I must
follow my classmates and help them
if it's hard for them.
You are so cheerful.
However, as always.
Recently, my brother got better.
Oh, that's great.
Apparently, the story of the hero
named Ingenium
will end here.
What are you doing, brother?
You still need to lead so many people!
That's why
I leave this case
to you.
Tell me, will you take
this name?
I also have to preserve the reputation
of my brother, Ingenium.
I watch over everyone.
I was the third
at the sports festival.
Now I will show everyone
the power of the will of the successor.
The power of the will of the successor.
People always
treat me like an idiot.
But still.
I was admitted to the U.A.
Hey, it's not true
that I don't think what I'm doing.
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about you!
A bunch of useless guys,
full zeros in intelligence.
Yeah, that's true.
Well, what can I do?
I'm talking to you.
We've already discussed it.
Of course you need to!
What?
Compare this place with Earth!
What an idiotism!
You didn't hear
what I said at the beginning?
What's that?
The sounds of metal
are breaking.
It's probably
the work of Tetsu Tetsu.
Tetsu Tetsu from Class B
is a miracle of steel.
The name of the hero is real steel.
It turns all
your body into metal.
It can become a better
The best shield or the best shield.
Here you go!
Take this!
You can't catch me.
Get out of the way, class!
We'll fight face to face to the death!
Did you forget that in that team there are roads?
I don't care!
You really don't think what you're doing?
Well, we can dance from this.
You're getting too easy, Juzo!
God, you can't keep us in the dark!
Punya spoke English!
She's angry!
Tetsu didn't think of anything bad.
His approach is based on our strong sides.
You're getting too easy, Juzo!
Come on!
The metal cut continues.
Judging by the vibrations, he's destroying the buildings around him.
Apparently, the opponents are planning to fight in the water.
We're waiting for a close fight.
It will be easier to handle.
Great!
Well done, class!
The third team!
The enemy is moving in the fifth round.
He's going to the port.
Just as we thought.
He got away.
Be careful!
You won't get away.
I'll capture the hostage.
Get out of here!
Let me go!
I won't do that.
All right, all right, stop it!
I'll take it easy!
Great job,
I'm sorry.
What?
You saved us.
Thank you.
Are you hurt?
No.
Take care of yourself.
All right.
Good job.
We've been called for help.
We'll do it as usual.
Yeah, make a list of requests.
Thanks to Fuyumi,
I finally,
finally
added Shoto to my friends.
I want to tell him something again.
Don't ignore my messages.
I've become different.
I don't care about your wishes anymore.
Don't turn away!
Don't you dare run away from yourself!
Get up!
Don't play the weak!
You're moving towards your wishes,
and I, as a good father,
will teach you how to do it.
So,
stop ignoring my messages,
Shoto!
Shoto!
The lesson has probably already begun.
Don't you think his shodamania is progressing?
Are you all right?
I didn't know you could catch a cold.
No, I think everything's fine.
They're almost here.
Let's act according to the plan.
Let's split up.
All right.
It's all up to you, Todoroki.
Tetsu, Tetsu,
the enemies won't take you and won't show up.
They'll think it's a trap.
No, I'm here for them.
Shoto will figure out what's going on.
Todoroki will be the basis of the attack.
It's a strong move.
They'll think we're in an open area.
No!
When he gives you the will, he's terribly strong.
It's not fair.
Now the ice doesn't block his view.
He worked on it.
No ice without Todoroki.
Where are the others?
I don't see them.
Even if Hananoki tries to soften his side,
it won't help,
since it's under the ice.
Now they'll notice the ice.
They can be grabbed together.
It's a fast explosion.
Attack!
What?
It's a weak trick to hit the ice.
If you worked with fire,
he wouldn't be able to do anything.
Hananoki Juzo from Class B.
Heroic name Grisevik.
Miracle of softening.
It softens objects by touching.
It doesn't work on the living.
Thank you, Juzo.
You did a good job.
It's not the topic,
but it's recommended in Class B.
He started the trick before the ice.
That's the speed.
I'd better step back and...
I found it.
I softened something by accident.
So, watch where you're going.
Class B does a great job
with attacking Todoroki in the area.
It's a great move.
Hananoki guessed the ice attack.
If so, the reaction is fast.
He's really good at analyzing.
He's a master at adjusting to the situation.
Well done, Juzo.
I'll deal with Odger.
Damn.
Damn, I can't stand it.
Kai Barasen from Class B.
Heroic name Spiral.
Miracle of softening.
It softens objects by touching.
It doesn't work on the living.
Spiral.
Miracle of rotation.
It can rotate any part of the body like a drill.
Odger.
What? Again?
The strength of your legs depends on the strength of the soil.
And the ice is soft now.
That's why it's so hard for you.
I'll leave you here to drown in the snow.
Are you trying to disobey the command?
You're such an inventive villain.
And he got into the role.
Now it's hard for them to move.
There are no master scouts in Class B.
But if everyone is gathered in one place,
this minus is leveled.
If the mass battle begins,
the miracle of Todoroki will be twice weaker.
Exactly.
That's why they only have to crush the enemy.
Taking into account everything,
neither fire nor ice will strike fully.
Go ahead.
But then no one will protect Shoji from the scouts.
Shoji!
I think their scout Shoji will be in a safe place.
And there's only one place here.
Todoroki is behind you.
Tsunatori Pony from Class B.
Miracle cannon horns.
It can launch horns into flight.
At the moment, it can control a maximum of four flying horns.
She has to take care of them.
They are much stronger than I thought.
Tetsu-Tetsu!
Don't move!
Claw of the Claw Pressure!
You bastard!
You are cold!
Cold as ice!
You freeze my steel, Todoroki!
Do you think you can beat me bare-handed?
Damn Tetsu-Tetsu!
Do what I was told only after the fight.
No, he's not that smart.
Hananoki provided him with an opportunity.
What's going on?
Can you just turn around?
Behave yourself!
Oh, you bastard!
Don't be angry.
Your acceleration is not eternal.
You shouldn't have wasted it at the very beginning.
He's not eternal.
You shouldn't have wasted it at the very beginning.
Well, I'm going to go help Tetsu-Tetsu.
Not eternal.
It was a long time ago, you bastard.
Ingenium.
It's going to blow up anywhere, at any moment.
That's why you need these legs.
I've been on full throttle all this time.
Come on!
New style!
Turbo acceleration!
Come on!
Come on!
Tenya!
Congratulations on your temporary license.
Thank you, bro.
You're overloading your engine.
Mom, tell him.
His body has grown.
Maybe he can already?
You're right.
But I think it's still too early.
Engine tuning?
Yes.
You have to pull out the silencers and train.
Then new ones will grow, which withstand more load.
This technique came to us from my grandfather.
Thanks to him, the heroes of the Ida family are struggling to help even more people.
Pushing out the engines is an incredibly painful process.
So be patient.
If you want to run more, then ...
I increased the acceleration power.
Reduced fuel consumption to a minimum.
Ten minutes.
At this time, I will not stop anyone.
I will not stop anyone.
I will not stop anyone.
I will not stop anyone.
I will not stop anyone.
I will not stop anyone.
I will not stop anyone.
I will not stop anyone.

I will not stop anyone.
I will not stop anyone.
I will not stop anyone.
I will not stop anyone.
I will not stop anyone.
I will not stop anyone.
I will not stop anyone.
I will not stop anyone.
In the next episode.
Thanks to the flexibility of the Maha Nenuki, the class A team is in trouble.
The key to salvation will be the new improved turbo acceleration of Ida.
And the left side of Todoroki.
Light your flame, Todoroki.
It is necessary that you become who you want with the help of your strength.
Next, the final of the third fight.
There will be an impressive conclusion.
Go beyond, plus Ultra.
