Yesterday jobение was just impossible.
Even though I was scared when he fought that guy again.
It's a pity, but isn't there a stronger hero here?
No, there isn't.
It's a pity.
And you too?
I can do it.
I can do it.
I can do it.
I can do it.
I can do it.
I can do it.
I can do it.
I can do it.
I can do it.
And you too?
You can restore energy.
Can you do it?
You wouldn't compare us.
I couldn't move for a while.
Now I can move my body forward.
In the style of fire!
Only my faith does anything to hurt you.
But I'm pretty fast.
I separated a few branches in advance.
Let's add my speed to your firepower.
Come on, I'll push you up.
Number one!
Re-created.
You.
It's me.
I'm from the past.
Or from another future.
Burn.
And rest forever.
Plus Ultra!
Full of fumes!
In the end.
He was proud and victorious.
Super manly!
He's number one for that.
The hawk is also amazing.
And handsome.
They think he's too fast for a reason.
Todoroki.
How's the caretaker?
Well, it looks like the condition is not too serious.
I see.
Thank God.
You can be proud of your father, Todoroki.
I'm sorry.
You can be proud of your father, Todoroki.
Yes.
I can.
Hey, the phone has been ringing for a long time.
Okay.
Stop lying to the fool.
Remember who you are.
Let you have a temporary license for now.
But still, there is confirmation and responsibility.
So behave like a hero.
Although two of you are still going for extra.
From now on, we will rise to a higher level.
So get ready.
So, today at the class hour ...
Education alarm.
Education alarm.
Theoretical villains have invaded the U.A. academy.
The class 1A heroes must arrive on the spot.
Please change and come as soon as possible.
Class 1A heroes.
Get to work!
Yeah!
About 80% of the world's population have miracles.
They are superhumans, and this is their special power.
To fight the villains who turn this power into evil,
a hero's profession was created.
I, Midoriya Itsuko, always dreamed of becoming a hero
and entered the U.A. academy of heroes.
Where I am going to meet my dream.
Here I found friends who share my goal.
Together we overcome any difficulties
and with smiles we save people.
We do everything to become the strongest heroes.
Yes, here it is.
My Heroic Academy.
The Heroic Academy
The Heroic Academy

The villains have intruded into the area of the beta.
For the time being, only this is known.
Let this be a lesson. We will put all our strength into this mission.
First, we need to understand the situation.
This is the reconnaissance unit.
We will do everything.
Tits, please look for the destroyed places.

North-East, about 900 meters.
There are sounds of destruction.
I see smoke from the explosions in the specified place.
Shoji Mezo, the hero of the tentacles, the miracle of the hands of the replicants.
Next to the river is a fallen building.
And it looks like it's burning.
I can't see the villains.

Now it's our turn.
Roger that.
Great.
The rescue squad is moving out too.
Engenium.
They're coming.
And Datenya, the turbo hero of Engenium, the miracle of the engine.
We're going too.
Roger that.
Momo, are you not going?
Where are you dragging me?
Looking for the villains.
This is not real.
What?

Roger that.
Tadaroki Shota, Shota's hero name.
The miracle of ice and flame.
Great.
It's time for us to shine.
Is that all?
What's going on with the man in trouble?
I found him.
Where is he?
Over there.
I don't know why, but I'm in trouble.
Togata!
What is he doing there?
He was on vacation.
How did this happen?
Bad news.
The bridge.
I'll pick him up, Tsukuyomi.
Okay.
Me too, Tsukuyomi.

You saved me.

Intelligence team.
Is there something about the villains?
Nothing.
We haven't found them yet.
Got it.
Keep searching.
Was my ice not enough?
One more flame.
And it will be stronger than the previous one.
The fire will spread quickly.
We need to put out the fire.
Yeah.
Let's do what we're going to do.
Uraviti, Celophan.
That's right.
Uraraka Achako.
The hero's name is Uraviti.
The miracle of weightlessness.

The fire won't go any further.
This time I'll finish him off.
The fire seems to be sorted out.
Thank God.
Okay, quiet.
Not a good sound.
Attention!
Something is approaching!
Wait!
Is it really...
Remember me?
I hope you didn't forget.
There are villains wandering around here.
Do you know that?
Hada is portraying a villain.
Here...
Another villain!
Magics too?
Damn.
Why should I be a villain?
Everyone is looking at me.
Imagine that they are potatoes.
They are not people, but roots.
I'm going home.
He just left!
Magics...
They are really leaving.
Is that okay?
Wait!
Magics!
You can't do that!
Play the role as you should!
Don't move, okay?
It's dangerous.
After all...
I'm a villain now.
Looks like they took a big three
for the role of villains.
Pinke in hostages.
We can break through from behind.
Yes.
Let's go.
Damn!
I told you not to move!
Don't you listen to me?
I hate disobedient kids.
Really?
Full power. Level 30.
Oh, I'm washed off again.
Let's go save him.
He is falling down on purpose!
Ingenium.
Yes.
People are in the lead.
Let Hades take care of Midoriya.
We will help save the man.
I got it.
So many sounds.
I don't get it.
What's going on?
Looks like Pinke is in hostages.
Come on, we need to save her.
We can't.
We need to stay here and continue the scouting.
Maybe there are no two villains.
What do you want, villain?
I want to go home.
You can go.
If I go...
Hades will get mad at me.
Like Mirio.
He asked me to do everything I could
so that you guys
would become worthy heroes sooner.
So I can't go!
A big trio is trying hard for us.
I'm so grateful, of course.
But it will be hard to deal with them.
There are fewer people here.
Somewhere invisible.
Uraraka!
No!
I got it!
You're Hagakure!
A twisted break!
Smile!
Toru Hagakure!
The invisible hero!
A miracle of invisibility!
What is it?
What?
I got you!
Hado!
Ogermasher!
A hero of martial arts!
A man with a tail!
A miracle with a tail!
Deku!
A hero's name is Deku!
A miracle!
One for all!
Strike!
Give up, please.
Why didn't you strike?
Because I couldn't.
Pity may cost you your life.
Now I'm...
the villain!
Deku?
I'll beat you!
Red Boundary?
Kirishima Eichiro!
A brave hero!
Red Boundary!
A miracle!
Thank you!
Here's our star!
It's too slow!
Damn!
I'm pushing too hard!
Kaminaridenki!
A hero of electric shock!
Lightning!
A miracle of static electricity!
Bakugo Katsuki!
A hero's name is not chosen!
A miracle!
Explosive wave!
There!
Game over!
That's it, Bakugo!
He was so good at samajiki!
We did it!
Yeah!
Hooray!
That's it.
That's it.
Praise the gods!
Too bad I didn't help much.
Yeah, you saved me.
Thank you.
The lesson is over, I repeat.
So they're done there too?
Yeah, looks like it.
Rana!
You bastard!
You were holding back!
No, well, your face is just so scary.
Don't underestimate me!
I don't care!
I don't care that you're just playing a role!
That you're a senior in class!
There are villains!
They're mine!
They're my enemies!
I had to go home.
Die!
Then bring Bakugo to the teacher's office.
It will be done!
We have a hero academy in the U.A.
We will become the best heroes!
We will become the best!
We will become the best!
We will become the best!

The End
The All-Powerful had the same pose, right?
The hand was different.
He used the left one.
I didn't know.
Anyway, thank you for winning.
Zero points.
That's a terrible start.
Sorry.
This is definitely an important victory.
Don't rush.
I didn't expect much.
However, it doesn't matter.
We don't know each other yet,
the All-Powerful.
The End
The End
Hi.
You're late.
The End
In the next episode...
The hero number one is a hard worker.
He barely won in a fierce battle
with the mysterious Nomu.
However, it turned out that
there were the League of Villains
and Yastrep behind this battle.
At this time,
something strange is happening to my body.
Next...
The Voices.
I'll take a close look at the secret
one for all,
and all for one.
