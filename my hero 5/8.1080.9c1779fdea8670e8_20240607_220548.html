        <pre>The world's first
It was a miracle that Hanenuki changed the course of the fight.
It seemed that the fight was developing in favor of Class B.
Oh, you bastard!
Don't be angry.
Your acceleration is not eternal.
You shouldn't have wasted it at the very beginning.
Well, I'm going to help Tetsu-Tetsu.
Not eternal?
It was a long time ago, muddler.
Hengenium will tear you to pieces at any moment.
That's why you need these legs.
I've been on full speed all this time.
New style. Turbo acceleration.

Something little has changed.

Somebody did something to me.

Someone, somebody made me feel very...
Anybody, somebody made me feel very...
oud
The speed is so fast that I can't even control it.
It's a bad thing.
I can't handle it.
You're under arrest, you scumbag.
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm not so stubborn to fight you.
I'm sorry, I'm not so stubborn to fight you in an unfavorable situation.
You shouldn't leave food at will, but I'm unlikely to capture it.
So I'd better hurry up to the guys and help them with something.
The ice is slowly becoming normal.
Did you hide for a counterattack?
He must already understand that it won't work.
Did you go to help the team?
What a speed, Ida!
Turbo acceleration, even faster than the Grand Arena.
You're just talking about your new style all the time.
That's how Ida started to work on her own.
I'll ask him to teach me how to hit.
You'd better look at Odger.
Odger is fighting as usual.
They're pushing him as usual.
But only Odger has changed.
You can do it!
Why does it hurt so much in the chest?
Do you know that you can't win with one parry?
I'm hitting, and he's reflecting.
I'm defending myself.
These hard things on my fingers are tearing me apart.
You're talking to me.
You're talking to me.
You're talking to me.
You're talking to me.
You're talking to me.
You're talking to me.
I got you!
Ida ghost?
I'll take him to jail and be back soon!
Odger, go to others.
I think there's a Spiritual duty.
I'll be quick Auf Wiedersehen!
and yes, stop it, but I just started, damn it, calm down already, I won't let the villain
get away, I've already missed him, well, did you see how heavy it is with him, normal people would immediately
run after him, then you don't have a place for a face-to-face one-on-one ingenious, that's what my brother would do,
so I'll go too, I'll go for a compromise on training, I'll probably go to the fight too,
you're in the dirt of the past, yes, they often tell me this,
my fist is hard, so it moves calmly even when frozen, it won't come off worse from this,
but I'll take an example from you, tetsu tetsu, only all kinds of nooks and crannies can tear the ice down
I will break through the ice defense with my fists of justice, if so, then I will put a wall of fire
george sanatorium on you understood come on step away from the distance you don't understand why
against you it's me your miracle doesn't work on me, his steel is hot, but this time my steel
is hot to the red, you see boris jara tetsu, I developed a miracle and so and you once sat in a
melted stove tetsu tetsu took up the road and he won't let him go at such a close distance the road
will not turn its blows a fierce flame does not work on me this is the highest degree of steel that I
managed to achieve, I went beyond my limits, pull the heat out of your body, and then go beyond
this, you will succeed, you just don't try, I'll be mad at you until you cut yourself off,
keep in mind that you have a power that no one can compare to why I now remember this
here are the teeth and patience, it doesn't matter whether I use ice or fire, you finally became the
perfect improved version of me, this is your strength, too,
back to
you
stronger
fire broke the camera
Even stronger, I can do more. I will burn you to ashes.
So I will become who I want to be.
Tadorki.
You are the firepower of the conqueror.
Hot!
He gives out an unimaginable heat.
I understand all this, Tadorki.
I understand!
After all, I am the heat of Tetsu.
There is a flame inside me.
I know it's hard for you.
I don't think you can hold on for so long.
Arasaka!
You will not refuse me in endurance.
Go beyond the limits!
You will not get away with such a simple burn.
Those who do not risk themselves for training will not be able to fight in real combat either.
The bar is higher and the limits exist to overcome them.
Enough talking.
I've already gone far away, but I still feel the heat.
I'll run back and help Tetsu.
I'm sorry, tentacle.
I never look at octopus in the ocean.
I don't like them.
I'm used to being afraid.
So I'll put you in jail and win the fight.
You can try.
Rage!
Octo-hit!
The end.
For you.
Thank you, Ojiro.
Fin tail!
If you don't shoot with your horns, they're not dangerous.
Oh, you managed with me in such a simple way.
I'll take her to jail.
And you help Todoroki.
That's it.
I'm taking you to the sanatorium.
I'll take care of my friends.
If you resist, you will get even stronger.
Oh, you!
Tail-hit!
Swirling!
I'm sorry, tentacle.
I'm sorry, tentacle.
Swirling!
Thank you.
You too.
Wow, what a swing.
Warn me before you do that, Mihonenuki.
I won't let you go even if you...
I don't need you to let me go.
Ojiro!
After killing four of my horns, I'll send you straight to the prison.
If you were in jail, you would be there.
No matter what, now the score is one to one.
What's the matter?
Did you slow down?
Todoroki!
You are slow too.
My head is spinning, my body is not listening to me well, I want to cool down, but first I need him to fall behind.
Go beyond the limit!
Tetsu, Tetsu, you will melt!
Hane... Nuki!
Damn! I'm losing consciousness!
Hold on!
I won't miss this time, dirtbag!
Hot! No, wait! You won't get away!
First save him!
I saw a lost child, took him to the emergency department.
I think such people are the best.
Stop, villain!
I have the priority of saving!
I'll get away from him with one blow!
He said he couldn't cope with the speed.
Leaving Ida for later was a huge mistake.
Damn, are we going to lose now?
If I turn off, the softened will become the usual.
I can't even leave something to help others, as Yoyorozova did.
I'm not even sad about something else.
There's only one thing in my head.
We lost.
Only...
I don't want my friends to lose because of my speed!
Tetsu, Tetsu, come here!
Wow!
Everyone is defeated.
However, they are not considered outcasts, since they are not in prison.
What will happen?
Damn!
My left hand and foot.
It's hard.
One leg strength is not enough.
Forgive me, Todoroki.
I didn't have one step left.
Just one step faster, and we would both get out.
Ida is conscious, but he can't move.
I give up the fight with Kaibara.
It had an effect.
He fought before he got to prison and helped to weaken Ida.
Well done, Kaibara!
You are the best player in the team!
Your
Todoroki!
You can't let Shouji take them and take them to prison.
What can I do?
I can't beat Shouji, even with all my horns.
And since I can't beat all four of them, I'll lose.
I'll put Todoroki down and then we'll have more points.
But it's hard to carry all three of them.
They'll catch me before I get there.
I lose, we all lose.
She took them.
Well, if that's the case...
Come on.
I'll go higher where he can't reach and see what happens.
Maybe we won't win, but we won't lose.
I'm sorry, Shouji.
I don't want to be the reason for our defeat.
She took her guys to Todoroki.
Shouji can't fly with her magic.
She ran away.
Deku, what's going on with Class B?
They probably chose a safe path.
If Pony leaves her guys, Shouji will put them in prison.
But why take Todoroki?
If he comes to his senses, even in the sky, he can be beaten with fire or ice.
That's how she secured safety.
But the fight won't end until they put the enemy down.
You're right.
But it will end.
Time is running out.
20 minutes have passed.
The third fight is over.
Each of you has a draw.
That's disgusting.
In a real fight, escape and wait for rescue is a reasonable option.
Iida is probably very upset.
Yes, but...
He was so cool.
Since many students are unconscious, they will evaluate their results later.
Get ready for the fourth fight.
Chimoki-chimoki.
Todoroki.
You finally woke up.
Here, eat a bar.
Ojiro has already eaten and left.
Todoroki.
We got a draw.
But it seems that I lost.
Well, you had a heat.
Let's do it again.
Can you be quiet?
A draw.
If I was faster, we could have won.
Iida.
I'm still too slow.
I could not react quickly to the flexible style of Hananuke.
But you saved me, although I do not remember well.
And I made the first mistake.
If you worked with fire, he would not be able to do anything.
I'm just used to using ice first.
Iida.
It's rooted in the body.
You are fast.
I'm slow.
I made you worry with my slowness.
I must become a hero who gives peace of mind.
No.
I would never call you unreliable.
I will always run.
Anyone and anytime.
This is my conviction as the successor of the Ingenium.
To be honest, I still have to work on the confrontation with you.
We'll fight again.
Of course.
Guys, if you feel better, then go back.
This is not a place for chit-chat.
Yes, I beg your pardon.
Oh, you were pressed to the wall.
Both classes have a victory.
If you lose or there is a draw, you will not win.
Come on.
It looks like he has a trick.
Oh, how did I wait for this fourth duel?
Why?
Yes, because Takagi participates in it.
Right, Bakuga?
All right, let's go.
Setsuna Takagi.
Another class B student who passed the recommendations.
Dangerous girl.
Kachan.
Come on, what?
Seriously?
It can not be.
Enough.
Here you will see the devil in the back.
To the position.
And we start.
The fourth duel begins.
I want to meet you again.
I've always been looking at your world.
I don't even know the tears that fell without a sound.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay...
It's okay...
It's okay...
It's okay...
It's okay...
It's okay...
It's okay...
It's okay...
It's okay...
It's okay...
It's okay...
It's okay...
It's okay...
It's okay...
Go beyond the limits! Plus Ultra!
