Class 1A and 1B go through a joint combat training and are almost equal.
At the end of the third fight, both classes have a victory and draw.
And so the fourth round begins.
Come on, what? Seriously?
It can't be!
Enough!
You'll see, damn it!

The first step is over for us.
It doesn't matter.
Let's go and finish them off.
Earlier, the bird was cleaning its nose.
Let's go after them.
Now the classes have a winner, a loser and a draw.
It may seem that they are on the same level.
However, the class won mainly thanks to Shinsu.
Are you serious?
It's very rude to say that.
His wonder is the control of blood, but it still boils.
He is overflowing with love.
That's all.
We have a legal protest here.
Are you going to say that in a real battle too?
Class B is working harder on plans and countermeasures.
You can't argue with that.
Apparently, the truth is on the side of Vlad.
You have some problems.
Did you know that problems usually come from immature people?
Class B worked hard every day and developed.
However, the class has not shown everything yet.
Do you like the class, all-powerful?
I like them all.
I can't wait to see what you're going to do.
Young Bakuga.
Move, brakes!
I have to listen to the movement.
Just run after me.
Are you always waiting for everyone to follow you?
And you haven't changed since the sports festival.
Well, at least now he cooperates.
Although...
Listen here, servants.
For now, just follow me.
You would change the tone.
And we're not your servants.
I'll lead you forward.
And you get ready to help, if anything.
Ears!
Listen, where are all the weaklings now?
I'm not your ears, I'm Jiro.
Are you going to attack?
Our opponent is good at counterattacks.
And Jiro is with us.
Let's wait for a convenient moment.
Let's wait and quietly...
Fool.
That's why we have to act first.
We will not wait for anything.
We will create an opportunity ourselves.
We will see them, we will win.
Is everything clear?
It's dangerous.
Take them just in case.
They are weak, but useful.
And also...
And our plan...
Will definitely work.
Here they are.
Ears!
I'm Jiro!
They are somewhere nearby.
Find them!
Hurry up!
Wait a minute!
They noticed me!
That's it.
I used Jiro's ability against her.
Setsuna Takagi from Class B.
Heroic name...
Sparrow-like.
Prichudo...
Self-amputation.
Divides the body into parts and can move them.
I'm Jiro!
I'm Jiro!
I'm Jiro!
I'm Jiro!
I'm Jiro!
I'm Jiro!
I am Jiro!
Jiro!
I'm Jiro!
I'm Jiro!
Jiro!
I'm Jiro!
I'm Jiro!
Oh, no!
Oh, no!
It's too dangerous for Jiro!
It's too dangerous for Jiro!
We can't lose!
Oh, great, it's all going according to Setsuna's plan.
Kojirabunda from Class B, hero's name is Plamo.
Prichudo is Semidin.
He shoots clean, and also controls the drying speed.
You're too slow!
Kamariki Togura from Class B, hero's name is Jack Bogomol.
Prichudo is Astrea.
He creates blades from any part of the body.
I got rid of the fat by creating noise in different places.
The bond was covered with the glue of the tube and the tape.
If you touch them, you won't break away.
I'll at least protect my own!
Bakuga!
What I need!
I'll take Zajir first!
Save for victory.
Win for salvation.
Actually, I've become much stronger!
Also, when you're in danger, I'll come to help you.
What? Blocked?
How long have you been so fast?
Come on!
Thank you!
Back off!
They ran away, look for them!
I don't care, we have a lesson or something!
Okay, I've already decided.
I'll win every battle!
4-0! No injuries!
That's it!
The real strong ones win!
Hey, wait!
Did I get something in my eye or something?
It seemed that he was protecting Jiro.
Yes, he was protecting Jiro.
That's our Bakuga.
Don't worry, Onama.
His eyes are fine.
So, his character has changed?
Well, maybe.
Actually, this is the first time I've seen him risk himself so openly.
You can't hit your forehead with Bakuga.
You'll have to...
You can't hit your forehead with Bakuga.
You'll have to retreat.
If we fight as usual, we will definitely lose.
That's why we retreat.
If we can't capture them,
then we will suddenly attack again.
And so we keep the advantage.
So loud!
True, now there are fewer of them.
Less?
And everyone is moving away.
They decided to get together?
Damn, they underestimate us.
There is one Bakuga in the enemy team.
The rest follow him.
If we create stress factors and Bakuga makes a mistake,
their team will be exhausted.
It's hard to figure out in the sounds.
But if they concentrate, I'll distract them.
Let's go!
Whoa, that's tough.
I don't have time for that!
Stick with me.
Wait!
You already have time for that?!
Come here, you black sheep!
I want to fight him!
He's a welder. He can weld things on a molecular level.
But to work with a welder, he needs to touch the object first.
They bit us.
You'll never catch me here with your tape.
Takagi thought of that, too.
And she really planned everything.
Sugar Jump!
Come on!
You can't weld me!
There's no need to be so angry.
Come on!
Now!
I'll do it!
When you're in danger, I'll come to help you.
And when I'm in danger...
The sound of heartbeats!
You'll come to help me.
It's dangerous.
There's also a bomb.
Damn it!
It's so hard to fight in winter.
Now I've warmed up at least.
I got him!
What a quick team work!
Two of my dear students were caught in an instant.
I thought he couldn't work in the team.
It's not in his spirit to calm down.
Bakugo!
Bakugo is acting on his own.
Bakugo is acting on his own.
Bakugo is acting on his own.
The others are helping him.
We need to find a good opportunity.
Use her until they break.
That's the plan.
X Catapult!
Why is their team so perfect?
It's all because he trusts Jiro and the others.
The game in the group helped.
The game on the drums.
Takagi divides the body into 50 parts and moves them.
Certain parts will stop moving after a while.
Then she will grow them on her own.
I'm still thinking about the next part.
But I don't think she will be able to recover forever.
I'm sure, like Eoi Rose,
she is less focused in a tired state.
If she divided as much as possible for Shouman,
it may be harder for her to grow new parts.
Takagi will return some of the parts that are moving.
Will she be able to regenerate faster?
Jiro said that there are fewer sounds.
That means I'm probably right.
It's dangerous.
Hey, you...
You've changed too much!
I haven't changed.
I always had one goal.
I want to surpass the All-Powerful and become the number one hero.
How?
How come?
It didn't take them five minutes!
Thanks to the unexpected teamwork,
Class A wins with an ideal score of 4-0!
There was no extra destruction.
You quickly captured and arrested them.
You focused on the mobility and strength of Bakug,
and you helped him perfectly.
Your plan was reliable.
You took into account the existing data and skills.
It's a pity that you didn't adjust to circumstances like Hananuki.
Guys, I'm sorry I embarrassed you.
That's it.
Since such a capable guy has become a good one,
we have nothing to be proud of.
That's right.
Nothing.
Kachan, it turns out you can do that.
Jiro was a real heroine.
Only I'm a hero.
It's like a criminal helped a wandering cat.
Only I'm a human.
Oh, you little rascals.
Maybe you're sick.
Kachan!
Get off!
I'm not even standing in front of you.
I'm moving on.
Yes, you're moving on.
You're moving on.
You're moving on.
You're moving on.
You're moving on.
You're moving on.
Yes.
You're moving on.
You're moving on.
You're moving on.
I'm moving on.
Get off!
Are you here for this?
I won't let you get away with this.
You stupid jerk.
You'll see.
You have a good childhood friend.
Go to hell!
I wish I was a little more decent.
This lousy, lousy, hysterical, inflamed guy was magnificent.
Monomo, I'm sorry.
With one victory, two defeats and a draw, Class B won't win anymore.
Why are you apologizing, Takagi?
Our immature companions thought about his actions and got better.
That's good.
I agree, Class B won't win anymore.
But we haven't lost yet.
I just want people to understand.
Some students worked hard and didn't fix the trouble,
and others deservedly attracted attention to all kinds of crap.
So whose path is it?
Every secondary character in the lives of other people.
But everyone in their own lives is the main character.
So what are we going to do?
Stop whining!
I think we should do the same as Takagi's team.
After all, our composition is similar from the point of view of balance of forces.
We have a lot of guys with technical tricks.
It's better to hide and hit from the back.
Besides, there will be five of us.
A close fight won't give us anything.
But you've seen their fight.
Midoriya, don't you think your soul will freeze?
Freeze?
She meant he was scary.
Oh.
Midoriya, huh?
In terms of mobility and combat skills,
he's as good as Bakugo or higher, right?
And Midoriya recently learned to attack from afar.
If we give him a little bit of weakness, we'll lose too.
He'll be able to find a way out of the situation.
So Midoriya will be our main task.
At any cost, we have to get rid of him first.
However, that time he coped with my trap.
However, in combination with Monome's trap,
I think we'll split up with him.
It's scary when you stand out so much.
After all, I can scare him.
What?
I think he won't be able to copy it.
In any case, if we don't get rid of him,
we won't be able to do anything.
We're counting on you, Shinsou.
Here's the fifth and last fight.
I wonder how Shinsou is doing.
His job will decide if he can move.
In the first fight, he showed his independence.
However, will his trick work again?
That's for sure.
Class A's team is strong too.
I hope he can handle it.
Shouldn't we go after Shinsou right away?
I'm starting to worry.
I don't want them to control me.
Don't worry about that.
There are a lot of guys in that team who can attack from anywhere.
And we can...
...attach them.
It's all very bad.
No chance.
We can't wait.
We can attack too.
Great!
We can turn my escape from the vineyard operation.
No one will buy it.
In general, we must first find them and lure them into the trap.
Then I'll be a bait.
Reiko?
How are you going to do that?
You said you had a magic trick.
Yes.
But everything is fine now.
The problem is that they saw our fight.
I think the enemy will be wary of me.
I'll have to move even more.
Can you do it?
We're counting on you.
I can.
I'm sure we'll win.
Yes!
Hooray!
Where did this confidence come from?
Everything is fine.
I'm moving on.
You can't catch up to me with my pace.
After what he said, I can't be ashamed.
It's time for the fifth fight.
He's the last one for today.
Are you ready?
Get ready to the very end.
Let's get started!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
In the next episode!
This is the final one for training today.
Who would pick an extra forgettable?
Don't be��.
There will be scenery effects later,
so you better keep it steady.
I'm our unique fail.
I'm good to go.
You can do it.
Enjoy the show.
The GT- stage even more exciting!
