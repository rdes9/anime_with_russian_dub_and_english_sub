        <pre>Yes, I agree, there was too much unexpected.
Tell me in advance, I could work more productively.
You talk too much, you can't keep track of the call.
What are you doing? I didn't think of anything like that.
Yastrip is talking on the phone.
With whom?
With his girlfriend, but not this.
This is a secret.
So many questions.
Just believe me, that's all.
I'm one of them, so I'm careful.
Work hard.
You can't get rid of me.
You called me like that because you yourself know how important I am to you.
If I continue to talk, you will rather think about returning to Chimariski.
And you want to use me.
This is your last chance.
Well, that's it.
You will prove your loyalty not only to the League, but also to the anti-social view as a whole.
This time not with the number one hero.
Dabi called me again.
He still has suspicions about me.
They are definitely following our conversation.
From now on, we switch to the encryption system.
I'll try to tell you as soon as possible where Nobu is.
That's it.
See you later.
You don't usually come to me.
How are you feeling?
Much better now.
Couldn't you ask the old woman from the UAE to help?
She won't restore what was lost a long time ago.
It turned out that people can survive without an easy job.
How's the hero's job?
I plan to leave the shadows soon.
Too many are waiting for my return.
Right?
It's a pity.
I'm a little nervous.
The time has come.
I have nothing to do with him.
The Heroic Network also has no mention of the activities of the League of Villains.
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.
The Heroic Network also has no mention of the activities of the League of Villains.
Something has happened.
It's obvious that now they are behaving differently.
Are you feeling his determination?
The last day of the year.

It's all somehow resolved thanks to the help of Uraraki and Shinsu, but that super power...
Mom! It hurts to hear such things!
By the way, Mom, do you remember Sherry, who I talked to on the phone?
Well, yeah.
In general, she wrote me a letter.
That's great!
She wrote it while studying the alphabet.
I couldn't help her with almost anything.
She worked so hard on the letter. That's great!
Don't! The neighbors downstairs will think the roof is leaking!
You've been pretending to be all-powerful since you were a child.
You said you would save other people by getting hurt.
But you weren't very strong.
That's why I thought I had to protect you.
I thought so for a long time.
But now, for some reason, when I look at your face,
I feel calm.
Mom!
And then the New Year started.
Did you take the handkerchief?
Yes.
Be careful not to catch a cold.
Okay. And don't forget to write.
Yeah.
Good luck on your internship.
I'm going.
It's time to go to the hard worker's agency.
I'm back.
Did you go somewhere, number two?
For coffee. The local one tastes like toilet water.
You can't fly further when you're thinking.
We need permission for everything.
What?
I'm higher than you in terms of rank and rank.
That's for sure.
Higher? I don't know.
I've never heard of it.
Maybe you have the right to get information from the Hero Center.
But...
We need all the calls from this point.
Talks in real time. What he sees.
There's a lot of micro-devices connected to the hawk.
So we'll find out everything about the heroes.
A worm like you will only look at the Hero Network in the best case.
And hero number two, the hawk, is capable of achieving more.
I've been watching you.
I almost took the black coffee, but I didn't.
I love sweets.
Welcome to the Worker's Service.
I wish I could say no.
I allowed it with all my heart.
Shota asked me to do it.
But he would be the best.
Since he allowed it, what now?
Shota!
I also noticed on the courses that you have everything.
Shota!
Are you really friends with this guy?
However, it is not only important for me to see the best heroes in the business.
Friends, you have to choose wisely.
Thank you for allowing me to go through your internship.
The Flaming Hero is a hard worker.
He has a frightening aura, but he is a reliable hero.
I was impressed by his strength at the sports festival.
To be honest, I'm even a little afraid of him.
But he has changed somehow.
Will you go to the Worker's Service?
All three of you?
Great.
Use this opportunity.
What about my training for all of them?
I don't think there will be any problems yet.
Since the day you dealt with these black fools,
new miracles have not appeared.
Since you can close and open them,
I don't think you'll break again.
Okay.
I would blow everything up.
Well, yes.
This is a good time for you, Bakuga.
What?
You and the Worker are somewhat alike.
It will be useful for you to personally look at what he is like now.
Since you both have the best heroes,
then use this chance.
We will study hard.
On the work of the hero number one.
You're not Shota, are you?
I'm not going to take care of anyone except Shota.
Do you want to study?
Look carefully.
We are waiting for your instructions.
Look from behind.
I received a divine message from the universe.
Run.
Run away, people.
The corners of Pluto's lips reflect loneliness.
The time of your fall is coming.
Well, well.
Unlucky moment.
I told you to look from behind.
So we have to go after him.
He started running even before the sound of the blow.
And it's not about speed.
I'm not going to let you go.
I'm not going to let you go.
I'm not going to let you go.
I'm not going to let you go.
I'm not going to let you go.
I'm not going to let you go.
I'm not going to let you go.
I received a divine message from the universe.
The stars of evil have agreed.
They need to be stopped.
This is a servant of the stars from the second district.
It's dangerous to wait for the heroes here.
Run, citizens!
You have the one who will destroy the source of the darkness!
I will take you to the clear water!
Come, the ambassador of Pluto!
Flaming Fist!
You control the glass, old man?
I see that you are capable.
But I don't understand.
Why do you need to arrange such a thing in my shift?
My body is burning!
Caretaker!
Evacuate the people!
It's time!
And once again!
What?
Ah, your trainees!
I'm Strip!
Alas, but I was a little faster.
It turned out that the caretaker had problems.
Seriously? Was it similar?
It was.
Tell me something.
Well, yes.
I asked to warn.
Oh, yes, I just happened to be close.
We are just followers of the servants of the stars!
We must obey!
Let me go!
Let me go until it's too late!
Then I'll figure it out.
Thank you.
He is the source of the darkness!
The light from his flame will bring darkness and destruction!
We have again corrected the darkness.
We are ready!
We are ready!
We have again coped without loss.
The city can sleep calmly while the fire burns in your eyes.
Hello!
I am a student of the Heroic Faculty Class 1A.
Midoriya Izuku!
I know.
You hurt your finger.
Tsukuyomi told me.
Oh, I wanted to work with him again.
Tsukuyomi...
Didn't he come back to work with you?
He works at home with my partners.
I have too many things to do.
I'm even ashamed of him.
I just found myself faster than you.
I'm not sure about that.
Well, Yastrip, what did you want?
Nothing like that.
I didn't want to, but I'm a hard worker.
Did you read this book?
The Battle for the Liberation of the Superhuman?
No, I didn't.
Did you read this book?
The Battle for the Liberation of the Superhuman?
What's wrong with it?
Well, that's the thing.
Lately, it has become very popular.
It's strange, but it's predicted to be real.
If you give freedom to several people,
then the negative consequences
you will notice in others.
I highlighted the main points
so that you can read them quickly.
Just read them.
As you know,
the head of the Liberation Army, Destra,
wanted one thing very much.
A society with full consciousness.
Very modern.
I'm sorry for the foggy hints.
I didn't understand anything.
If we get to the implementation of the goals,
then we have a lot of time.
Follow me.
So I can only say this.
Well, guess what, number one.
I just want to live in peace.
I just want to live calmly.
I want to create a world
where heroes have a lot of time.
I have a feeling that something is wrong.
Why does he have such an expression on his face?
Be kind, read it.
He is persistent with this book.
It's worth reading.
Maybe it's a secret of his speed?
Huh?
And here I just captured it for you.
What kind of preparation?
Where did he get them from?
That's right, it's time number two.
With such speed.
Are you beginning to predict the event?
He even handed out books quickly.
You like this book so much
that there are several copies.
I think they are for distribution.
That's right.
I advise all friends
and heroes in the country.
At least they will find work
for liberating ideology.
At least look at the part
that I noted.
I highly recommend the second one.
Good luck with the internship, guys!
Teach your schoolmates well,
intern.
He is still young,
but he doesn't look like us.
He is only 22.
He is only 6 years older.
It's annoying.
Yes, indeed.
Society with full awareness.
Welcome to the hard worker's agency.
We are the flame partners.
Oh, this is the famous
hot partner.
Bakugo and Shota.
You came to the internship for the first time,
right?
From today you will work
just like us, guys.
As you can see, the agency is big.
There are more than 30 partners here.
So there will be no special opportunities
to shine.
Interesting.
We need to shut up for the profile belt.
Exactly.
Shota, don't expect a special relationship.
Even if you are a hard worker's son.
We received a request.
Where from?
Area 37.
Contact the patrol immediately.
They are too far away.
I'll go.
So many things are happening here.
But this is agency number one.
We are either in the patrol or on the alert.
We are waiting for emergency calls.
We are working with the guides.
We deal with hundreds of requests a day.
So we need to take up the case as soon as possible.
It's annoying that this duck
is so fast.
I see your mood.
Wait for instructions from the patrol.
Tell me hundreds of requests.
What is it?
Hatchan, stop it.
I don't understand.
You became number one.
And I want to be your leader.
And then proudly tell people
not to worry.
It was completely different now.
Society with full awareness.
Very modern.
He seemed to speak the opposite.
Yastrip said he thought with a proud smile on his face.
When I saw him,
it always seemed that he was joking.
And now the other way around.
At least look at the parts
that I noted.
I don't recommend the second one.
He usually doesn't say that.
Yastrip can't tell me anything,
but he still tries.
The second part.
Can you see?
The second word.
The second word in each part.
I'm writing words.
The commission should have
I don't know how to decrypt my code, although, of course, the efforts are not particularly convincing.
Maybe my hints were too subtle?
Several heroes are in the army of liberation.
The commission does not want people to know about this.
To understand by facial expression is a horror, even when it comes to me.
But what did I have left?
Neither electronically nor written to send.
The enemy.
This is the army of liberation.
There are already more than a hundred thousand of them.
In four months.
Everything is correct.
In four months they will make their move.

You were at the source of my nightmare.
So I will save you someday.
So I will save you someday.
So I will save you someday.
This is the preview!
We've learned a lot from the scouts, we've learned how to work together with Hacchyan.
It's important for me to learn to control my strength and act as best as I can.
It's not that slow, the main thing is that I'm moving forward.
Next, step by step.
All this will make me the greatest hero one day.
Go beyond, plus Ultra!
