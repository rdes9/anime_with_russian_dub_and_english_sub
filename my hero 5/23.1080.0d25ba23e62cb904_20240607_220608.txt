Toga, the teenagers are terribly scary.
Your data has changed.
I forgot that you were growing.
And there is a sexual intercourse.
I'll measure you again, then I can create you.
I'll create more of you and pour blood.
I'll measure.
No, I'll measure.
No, I'll measure.
Go look in the stock.
You have already made your two copies.
And I can do more.
I'll measure.
No time to argue.
Toga is on the verge of death.
Let's act together.
I wanted to double her when she was healthy.
We measured her already in this state.
The cute face was badly hurt.
Can this be corrected?
Surely Dabi will advise a plastic surgeon.
You will survive.
I give the word.

I must help Shigaraki.
I will do everything I can.
You are not allowed to stand in front of me.
Those who do not know the concept of the role will be blocked.
This is how modern children talk.
Whatever you try to say,
your judgment is like health.
It is only worth taking someone with such a weak power for this.

He is the villain Rupert.
He is the super power of awakening.
He is using electromagnetic waves to encourage those who believe in him.
He is also increasing his mental and physical abilities.
He is also increasing his mental and physical abilities.
We're retreating!
Super-power Gekkon.
Looks like you can't do anything except climbing.
You were one of those prisoners who were bullied in school.
Are you here because you're angry about your past?
Unfortunately, I don't consider you a human.
Unfortunately, I don't consider you a human.
You're capable of achieving anything.
They're already there.
What were the warriors doing?
I got you!
I got you!
Spinner!
Everyone!
Go to the Commander-in-Chief!
They attacked the very soul of this army!
Hmm.
I think you're capable of achieving anything.
I...
I know it better than anyone.
Listen to me.
I know I can't do anything like Toga, for example.
Nothing I'd like to do.
But at that time, my heart was still burning.
Come on, let's destroy everything at once.
At that time, I wanted to see the future that he saw.
That's what I was thinking then.
If I didn't start working with others, I'd be left with no one.
That's who I am!
Something's not right, huh?
It is.
You guys are exactly the same.
Right, politician?
Are you putting us in a row?
I will definitely make it easier for Shigaraki.
I'm alive.
I knew that Shigaraki would do that.
You're so big.
Listen, what do you need now?
How many of them were there?
110,000 people?
You decided to take the number, and you can't climb yourself?
You created a crowd of places where they would deal with a weak enemy.
You didn't take it seriously.
You thought we wouldn't get here.
And then it all fell on you.
That's what I'm asking.
Who are you?
Who am I now?
Of course, I'm angry.
I'm one of those who copes with anger and grudges.
That's what you did with my forehead.
You killed many warriors to get here.
Is this the palm that does evil?
Yotsubashi Rikiya!
The villain's name is Redestro!
Superpower Stress!
It turns the accumulated stress into strength!
The more it is, the bigger and stronger it is!
You shouldn't judge people by their wits.
Great advice.
I was taught the same thing when I was a child.
The problem is that superpowers are connected to the personality.
Take your ability to destroy what you touch with your five fingers.
I haven't had time to ask you, Shigaraki.
What time do you live with?
What do you create?
Or maybe you're an empty shell that just crashed into destruction and doesn't create anything?
These are your mother's hands.
Your grandmother's.
Your grandfather's.
Your father's.
Your heart is made very thoughtfully.
Negative emotions, like anger and sadness, pass over time.
Keep them close to your skin so that these feelings don't disappear.
Do you have any problems again?
Hanna, my older sister.
Come on, don't say anything.
I just told my father that I want to be a bride.
Let's go.
I see.
That's what happened.
If I cried, she would always be there for me.
Hanna was the only one.
It was just the child's innocent words, but...
The head is round.
Everything is spinning, spinning, spinning.
Memories are broken and coming back.
You...
I don't care.
I don't know what to do.
I don't care.
In place of the unclear anger in my head,
these lost memories came.
Emotions create emotions.
I thought all five fingers were needed for this.
So the information was wrong?
Or...
The head is split.
Sometimes superpowers come across something unexpected.
They develop.
Geto learned to influence the temperature of ice.
After one day I accidentally burned myself.
This young man has to wake up now.
So fast.
He was hiding most of the techniques,
and the grace of the cat itself.
Since he is so physically developed,
then he could touch a couple of heroes in stone.
And with such superpowers...
Maybe he trained?
And these movements.
You can't get rid of them
unless you survive in harsh conditions,
always on the verge of death.
I got rid of my stress too,
so I understand.
I decided too early,
as if you were weaker than me.
Judging by how much damage you took and didn't disappear,
you are real.
Liberation!
80%!
Time's up!
Stress power!
I'm done with this party.
Time!
Listen, Tenku.
You like hags, don't you?
Don't cry.
Or I'll cry too.
Grandpa and Grandma were kind.
But...
No.
No, that's not it.
Now I remember everything.
At that time, I wanted to tell them that...
What's the matter, skeptic?
Redestro, be careful!
It's coming to you!
He invited something terrible!
Redestro, they...
They were hiding this creature!
Redestro!
Redestro!
Do you hear me?
It can't be.
Time pulls and materializes stress.
It releases it to a large area.
These are the peaks of my superpowers,
which I've been grinding since I was a child.
I can't turn away from it with one desire.
It touched me at that moment,
forgot about self-preservation instinct,
for the sake of destruction.
All my feelings have intensified.
Details float to the surface,
as if it was yesterday.
You asked me what I was going to create?
You got it all right.
I want...
I want to destroy it.
Then disappear.
The world has no future without creation.
I don't need it.
Did you play the hero again?
Katara, stop it! It hurts! Stop it!
If you don't like it, you have to listen.
Katara!
There was a rule in my house.
The only rule created by my father.
We were forbidden to talk about heroes.
It's time to have dinner.
His allergy has intensified again.
There is a rule.
He won't come in until he apologizes.
You're overreacting.
He still hasn't mastered the spell.
If we don't make Tenka understand, he'll suffer.
The desire to become a hero leads only to suffering.
Mom, Dad, do you understand?
My father was a businessman.
He was still young.
He built a house for two families
and invited his relatives to live there.
Don't scratch yourself.
It's very itchy.
We don't know what your allergy is.
It's terrible.
It's itchy when I'm at home.
Listen, Tenko.
Do you still want to be a hero?
Yes.
No one plays with Mika.
Neither does Tomo.
That's why I offered them to play together.
We played as heroes.
It was very fun.
Then Mika said
that I should be omnipotent.
Because I'm kind to them.
I played when everyone didn't want to.
Why does Dad forbid me?
Does he hate me?
Will he allow me to have a miracle?
He doesn't hate you.
He just knows
how hard it is to be a hero.
The words of adults were the law.
That's why I wanted to hear something from you.
Just one word.
The house that my father built
rejected me in its own way.
It's a secret.
Children are surprisingly simple.
I was told that this is our grandmother.
She's a hero.
Hanna, why did you show me this?
Dad says a lot of things.
But everything will be fine.
I root for you, Tenko.
Let's become heroes in secret from Dad.
Yeah.
Grandma was a hero?
There was a hero in my family.
Mon, now it seems to me
that I can handle any difficulty.
That day was very wet.
Tenko!
Did you come into my office?
The wetness after the rain
scratched my skin.
Did you see?
Oh, oh, these days.
This is Tenko.
Tenko told me to look.
I even scratched my stomach.
Kataro!
This is not your grandmother.
This is a cruel woman.
A child who threw up.
Help!
Don't just...
Hey, someone help me!
Someone!
Listen, for the sake of saving other people,
strangers, heroes hurt their own family!
This house was built by my father.
I'm sorry I had to leave.
Now your mom needs to go fight
with very bad people.
Those villains can hurt you too.
Therefore, I will have to leave you, Kataro.
I'm sorry I couldn't give you
what mothers should give.
Maybe in the end you will hate me,
but I will always love you,
my Kataro.
I love you very much.
I hope your life will be full of joy,
and you will be happy.
Kataro,
mom will always look after you from heaven.
You'd better just hate me.
Enough already!
I overcame the stick.
Where are the children?
If you hit them again,
I will renounce your rules.
You wanted a happy family yourself!
Everything was supposed to be different.
I can't.
I can't do it anymore.
Mom, I...
I can't!
All of them! All of them!
All of them!
I hate them!
Mom?
Tenko!
Listen. Listen.
I... I didn't want to.
I decided to show you a secret.
Mom?
What's wrong with you?
Stop! Don't run away!
I can't talk!
Hana, you came to apologize, didn't you?
If that's the case,
then protect me next time!
Help me!
It seemed to me that
some terrible villain came after us.
When Mon fell apart,
and then Hana fell apart,
I still thought that it was the hands of the villain.
No, not like that.
Now I know
that at that moment
I probably already understood everything.
Why didn't they protect their father?
Why didn't they just tell me not to cry?
I can't do it anymore.
Everything was slowly accumulating.
I hate you!
Tenko!
Tenko!
I hope your life
will be full of joy.
Dad! Dad!
I'm sorry!
Dad! Dad!
Tenko, stop it!
At that moment,
you didn't intend to kill.
And I touched my father.
Die!
My body was pierced by an insane feeling of enjoyment.
In the depths of my soul,
I have long wanted
this to happen.
I didn't scratch anymore.
Once upon a time
in a land of酒
there was a friend
who loved
and loved
and loved
and loved
and loved
and loved
and loved
and loved
and loved
and loved
I look at the line that will never come back
Someone tells me
That there is no meaning
To the sorrow of being abandoned
Look at the flames that were lit
It's not a lie
It's not a lie
The future from now on
No matter where you go
I feel like I can connect
To the root of the nightmare
I will save you one day
I can save you
I can save you
Look further
He has nothing to lose
There is no need to live
The hand that stretched to him then
Shimuretenko's life has changed forever
It was then that the successor of the devil was born
Further
The roots of Shigaraki Tomure
Unlimited, fearless
Give your will with your impulse
Go beyond the limits
Plus Ultra
