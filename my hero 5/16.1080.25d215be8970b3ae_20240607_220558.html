Midoriya Bakuga
If you don't have any options,
then maybe
you'll go through the internship of hero number one, the hard worker?
All the students of the Heroic Faculty of the U.A. Academy
go through the Heroic internship during their winter vacations.
Kachan and I, the road workers,
got into the agency of hero number one, the hard worker.
Mineta, Kaminari,
Seiro and Shiazaki went to work with the team and the observers.
Kirishima, Tetsu-Tetsu and Amadjiki
are working at Zhurnoshbach.
So, everyone is busy.
They work at the beginning of the most different heroes.
And we...
The first day with the hard worker is over.
And we hardly sang after him.
Uraraka and Asu,
like in Ryukyu's agency,
are probably working in the same way.
The Heroic Faculty of the U.A. Academy
The costume I ordered has finally arrived.
It's very beautiful, Ochako.
It suits you, Ura Viti.
Thank you very much.
Listen, why did you need a new costume?
It's not just like that, is it?
Well, it's kind of...
Actually, it's a secret.
What secret?
Why?
It's very strange.
Girls, we wish you success at the internship.
We have arranged a small holiday for you.
That's right.
For us!
They are having fun there.
What?
They are having fun there.
What?
The Heroic Faculty of the U.A. Academy
So, let's move on to the next news.
A week later, huge fires in the country of Kafele
have finally begun to subside.
It is believed that the fire caused the explosion
of an illegal trigger factory.
Trigger?
Oh, I know what it is.
Shall I tell you?
Trigger is a drug for amplification of miracles.
Yes.
It improves miracles and makes them more powerful at times.
Trigger is like an amplifier.
It is widely used in Japan.
It's good if the explosion slows down the spread.
The factory is just a place of production.
The trigger substances were stored in the warehouse.
But then they disappeared.
According to rumors, they were stolen even before the explosion.
So, the factory was blown up to hide the evidence
and hinder the investigation?
I don't know.
In any case, these are just rumors.
Hey, unknown ship!
Turn off the engines now!
This is the territory of Japan!
In a foreign country!
I'll set you up there!
Captain, you are only provoking them.
What?
Oh, yes.
Um, unknown ship!
Please stop!
Otherwise ...
You're in trouble!
That's not nice.
And they don't see you anyway.
Captain, there's someone on the ship.
What?
Oh!
Smoke curtain!
Zero visibility!
There are many targets on the radar!
Most likely this is a shipwreck.
Sea of ​​cuckoo! Full forward!
We go through the curtain!
Yes, sir!
A man on an unknown ship
pierced himself three times.
Yes, and judging by the route of the ship's investigation,
they probably sailed out of Kaplan.
But there are rumors that before the explosion,
from the warehouses, they stole the substance for the trigger.
Well, do you want to say chemicals on this ship?
I feel that something is wrong here.
We will soon go through the curtain!
Yes, sir!
We will soon go through the curtain!
We will soon go through the curtain!
We lost an unknown ship.
On the radar, it's clear.
Damn, can they escape?
With their route in mind.
They can hide behind the islands of Veridze.
Well, that's the case.
Those people have a trigger.
We need more soldiers.
The system of the Veridze island is complicated.
Searching the sea is not enough.
We need to find a way to get there.
Yes, sir!
We need more soldiers.
The system of the Veridze island is complicated.
Searching the sea is not enough.
We need to find a way to get there.
Well, that's the case.
Sirius, ask for a unit.
With what team?
With the 10th from the hero rating.
Hero of the dragon Ryukyu.
Ryukyu, we are asked to unite.
With whom?
With the sea hero Silky.
The hero you practiced with, right?
Yes.
What's going on there?
Take it, Froppy.
Nedger, get ready.
Ryukyu's team is coming.
Yes, sir!
Thank you for coming, Ryukyu.
If this ship is really connected to the trigger,
we can't let it go.
We are glad to help you, Silky.
Thank you very much.
I'm very glad.
It's not nice at all.
How nice?
You haven't changed at all, Captain Silky.
Oh, hi.
Are you all right, Froppy?
Yes.
Thank you for helping me practice.
We will follow the orders of the captain.
We believe that his decision is the best option.
And you, believe in Froppy.
Believe in the captain and in us.
You seriously taught me important things
that every hero should know.
You've grown up so much.
I...
I...
I...
So touched!
It's not nice at all.
How nice!
Tsuyu, you already got a temporary license.
Congratulations!
Now you are a full-fledged hero.
I'm looking forward to seeing you on this mission, Froppy.
Kill!
All right.
I'm sorry for being so sudden.
But you have to go to the beach.
Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Kill!
Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Charge up with new powers!
Throw, throw!
What are you up to?
I thought about it.
Come on.
I don't think the ship with the trigger will move until the sunset.
There's no need to be on the platoon before the time.
And...
I'm throwing!
I'm glad they're having fun.
Such peace!
Now I understand what you were thinking.
We, heroes, constantly encounter evil.
We see it all the time.
That's why you decided to show them some peace.
That's how they'll want to protect that peace.
That's why I'm here.
I'm here.
I'm here.
I'm here.
I'm here.
I'm here.
That's exactly what you were thinking.
To fight evil, you have to be in the right spirit.
Heroes and coast guard in combat readiness.
What are we going to do?
Contact the client?
No.
We're going to assume that they're listening to us.
And they're watching the satellites.
I guess we just have to follow the plan.
Yes.
We're moving out in the dark.
Prepare the triggers.
When it smells like fried food, we'll have to rely only on them.
We're from Nedger.
We're going to look for them from the air.
Selkie, you go get the Euravit and the Froppi.
Okay.
Get the anchor up.
Yes, sir.
I'm going to go get the Euravit and the Froppi.
Okay.
I'm going to go get the Euravit and the Froppi.
Okay.
I'm going to go get the Euravit and the Froppi.
Okay.
The docking rope is off.
Small forward.
The rope is freely going.
Right gauss.
Great.
The sailor is looking forward.
We have to go too, Nedger.
Okay.
The hero is Ryukyu.
The miracle is a dragon.
As the name suggests, it becomes a dragon.
It can fly thanks to the wings on its back.
Super cool.
The hero is Nedger.
The miracle is a wave.
It transforms the life of the dragon into a wave.
It transforms the life of the dragon into a wave.
It transforms the life of the dragon into a wave.
It transforms the life of the dragon into a wave.
It transforms the life of the dragon into a wave.
It transforms the life of the dragon into a wave.
Controls by these shock waves, it can fly.
Well screwed.
Serius?
Are you going to do Morse debug?
Yeah.
Froppi come.
The sailor is a SEAL.
And the hero is Selkie!
A miracle! A spotty seal!
He can do almost anything, even a real spotty seal.
He can even dive 1.5 km underwater and make the sounds of a sonar.
He can find the enemy by driving from them.
Reef ahead!
The enemy is unnoticed.
Thermo sensor without changes.
Moving to the next point.
Yes, sir!
Ryukyu, tell me what you have.
Ryukyu says, we're clear.
Tell me where to fly now.
Got it.
Fly to point 43.
Roger that.
The time has come.
We're in a hurry.
If they spot you, put your weight on.
Roger that.
There it is.
This is a message from the captain.
Sirius!
A miracle! A spotty seal!
He can hear frequencies that are inaccessible to humans.
The contrabandit ship is at point 57.
The captain is following them.
Left wing!
Point 57. Roger that.
Nedger?
Yes?
Stay close!
We've been spotted!
What?
How?
The radars can't spot us.
They're in the sky!
In the sky?
Something's on the radar!
There's a watchtower ahead!
What's that?
This is some smoke.
There's a watchtower ahead.
There are multiple targets on the radar.
It's a trap!
Everything's as planned.
What?
Are they on board already?
Where are they coming from?
How?
I'm a seal!
Froppy, stay where you are!
What was that sound?
How did you get in here?
Hit!
Selkie!
We've taken the bridge.
We've taken the bridge.
We've taken the bridge.
We've taken the bridge.
We've taken the bridge.
We've taken the bridge.
Great!
Ryukyu, over.
Ryukyu, over.
We see the target too.
We'll keep covering Selkie from the air.
Ryukyu, look!
There's a boat behind us!
So this is their main transport.
They're running away.
I thought it was a cargo ship.
Froppy!
Ryukyu, follow them!
Froppy!
I'm fine.
The speed difference is too big.
Damn, is this the end?
Captain, it's not your style to surrender.
There's still a way to catch them.
Ura Viti, are you ready?
Yeah.
When it's all over, we'll have a rest on the beach.
And we'll have a barbecue.
That's right.
Forward!
We can't do it again.
Don't even think about it.
I'll figure it out.
I'll help you as best I can.
I promise.
I promise!
What?
Gunhead's martial art!
Gravitation plus!
So, so, what do I do?
What? What's going on?
Ura Viti, pull the steering wheel!
It won't come out. It'll stall anyway.
Ochako, get out of there! Ochako!
I can't.
If the hydroplane breaks down,
its cargo will flow into the ocean.
And then the prohibited drugs will mix with the local ecosystem.
Ura Viti, make the plane weightless.
Well, it's too heavy.
Making such a huge plane weightless will be too...
Are you giving up already?
No, I'm not giving up.
Nedjere, I'm here.
Full charge.
90 power.
Nedjere wave!
Come on, Ura Viti!
I'm not giving up!
We did it.
The plane is intact. Ryukyu too.
But it's not good for Ura Viti.
Oh, Ryukyu says she took the cargo.
We weren't wrong about the prohibited substances.
So, the task was successfully completed, right?
Yes, the task was completed.
Yes, the task was completed.
Yes, the task was completed.
Yes, the task was completed.
Yes, the task was completed.
Yes, the task was completed.
Whoooo!
Judging by the question report,
the smugglers were ordinary couriers,
they didn't know what would happen to the cargo later.
Their client used a prepared name,
so the investigation was in the deadlock.
I understand.
The only thing they found out
I don't know what they were up to there, but we stopped them earlier than they did it, and it's good that it ends well.
It's not nice.
Yes, I recently realized it.
Well, okay.
I suggest we enjoy this moment of peace.
I don't know what they were up to there, but we stopped them earlier than they did it, and it's good that it ends well.
I don't know what they were up to there, but we stopped them earlier than they did it, and it's good that it ends well.
I don't know what they were up to there, but we stopped them earlier than they did it, and it's good that it ends well.
I don't know what they were up to there, but we stopped them earlier than they did it, and it's good that it ends well.
I see. So the heroes are involved.
What do you want me to do?
Nothing. We've got enough to do the plan.
So, let's get started.
Human salvation.
Look ahead.
Next.
We're all working at the Worker's Agency.
And we're working on our weak spots.
When we see the Worker in action, we find new flaws in ourselves.
And in the midst of all this, the Worker invites us to visit him.
Next.
The hellish Todoroki family.
It turns out Todoroki has an older sister and brother.
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
