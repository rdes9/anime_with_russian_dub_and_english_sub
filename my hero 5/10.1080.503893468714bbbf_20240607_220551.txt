Since the time has not yet come, it means that it will come one day.
Then something will happen to the heir one for all.
It will be difficult to communicate with Class B Shinsou's team when we open fire.
And my worries about one for all did not go to the end.
I can't get under the control of Shinsou's mind at all.
Since childhood, people have been telling me that with such a miracle, a superhero will not come out of me.
What are you talking about?
We both realize our limits.
For the sake of survival, we use good and evil.
I like you, because we are the same field of berries.
I hope not.
I hope not.
Alas, it is so.
And how did you make Midoriya talk at the sports festival for his miracle?
I didn't know him, so I just insulted his classmate.
In order to become a hero, you always have to behave like a hero.
Otherwise, we will not win the force capable of anything.
We are similar, but we do not reach the idols.
Didn't you feel that your childhood dreams and hopes are becoming more and more difficult?
Like a curse.
It looks like Midoriya's team is repeating the construction of Bakug's team.
They have a similar balance of power, except for the role of Jiro.
Can I say that this is intelligence?
They don't have it, so they'll have to be careful.
You're right.
If they decide to find the enemy by tricking him,
then Midoriya will have to work much harder than Bakug.
First, I'll draw the enemy's attention to something bright.
I'm the fastest, and Class B won't be able to ignore me.
They'll attack me.
We'll find them and capture them together.
It's started!
This is Poltergeist Yanagi.
Monomo!
Oh, so you found me.
We saw Bakug's fight, so of course we were wary of you.
You're right.
I'm wary of strong people who can move like him.
I wish a smart person would think of you like that.
On the other hand, a smart person would think of something else.
That guy was so strong thanks to the help of the other three.
That's why we should start with this trio.
Thank you for giving me your location yourself.
Looks like my allies have already found your dear guys.
He's provoking me.
Most likely, he copied Shinsou's mind control.
There are three of them against four of them.
Do you think they can handle it?
There's Shinsou there, so they won't be able to communicate.
I think it's time for you to hurry them up.
Oh, wait.
What if that recent scream was made by Shinsou?
It looks like you're going to give me the location of the team yourself.
Oh, come on.
You didn't even look at your guys?
Heartless.
He's trying to find them, in my opinion.
He won't make it.
Well...
Hey, it's Monomais from Class B.
The hero's name is the Ghost Thief.
This is a copy miracle.
After touching a person,
they copy his miracle for five minutes.
Two miracles don't work at once.
Does he have Yanagi's miracle?
It's cancelled.
I heard a voice.
It wasn't me.
So, Shinsou...
He's not far away.
I'd like to see his white face.
Look at us before you speak.
Something's stuck.
Oxidation.
It's gone.
The signal is blocked.
Or is it a trap?
It's Yanagi's Poltergeist.
Right everywhere.
Yanagi Reiko from Class B.
The hero's name is Emily.
The miracle is Poltergeist.
He can control anything up close.
However, he can't lift something heavier than human weight.
Koda Yui from Class B.
The hero's name is the Rule.
The miracle is size.
It changes the size of things and touch.
It doesn't work on living things.
It's cancelled.
Let's us see it now.
I want another impact.
Fish on the floor?
I saw them going.
Keep it together.
Yurengeki Kishuura from Class B.
The hero's name is Min.
The miracle is double impact.
It can repeat a hit on the spot.
The second impact is much more powerful.
Let's hide and prepare for the second round.
Round two, charge!
I was scared.
What's Midori doing there?
He didn't distract the enemy at all.
I think they've already figured out where we are.
What's up with Deku?
I had a chance to talk to Shinsou.
We discussed how the gifted destroy the world.
I have a question for you.
Please explain how Bakugou can smile so carelessly.
He was caught by the villains.
Is it his fault that the symbol of the world disappeared?
It's the villain!
He looked at me and said,
the time has not yet come.
What exactly is the time for?
What's going on?
What?
Another new power?
I'm sick of it!
What's going on?
Everything was fine just now!
Run!
Shinsou!
Shinsou!
Run!
The power is overwhelming me!
I can't hold it!
What's going on?
Deku!
What's going on?
What's going on?
Enough!
It hurts!
Why?
Midori has another new technique?
Aizawa!
Vlad!
Stop him!
Something's wrong!
Why?
What's going on?
Why?
The day the Almighty gave me the power,
I was constantly suffering because of my ignorance!
Enough!
Go away!
Despite that,
I started to control with my power!
It was just the beginning!
Go away!
One for all!
I don't want anyone else to worry!
Deku!
Deku, calm down!
When I was a child, my parents looked tired all the time.
It was painful for me to see them like that.
One day I saw the hero for the first time at work.
But I didn't look at his actions,
but at the expressions of the observers.
I liked that everyone was so happy.
And that's why helping others was an ordinary thing for me.
But sometimes an ordinary thing can be incredibly difficult.
I watched how desperately he fought for the sake of helping others and thought...
Deku!
The heroes protect people,
but who will protect them when it hurts?
Enough!
I can't do it!
We can't control Deku!
Shinsuo!
Help!
Stop Deku with your magic!
Control Midori?
What can I say?
One day I lost to you.
I was delighted.
Now I wanted to show you my new self.
I waited patiently for the next fight.
I wanted to become a worthy hero and help others with my magic.
Midori!
Will you fight me?
Yes!
Again?
Hey!
Hey, you!
You didn't get it!
Didn't get it!
We told you that you're not alone!
Did you forget?
The time has come!
It's obvious!
But...
You won't be able to use your strength anymore.
Remember that.
Is this one of the heirs?
One for all?
Work harder!
Work harder!
Try harder!
With hard work, almost everything will work out by itself.
Hey, did you swallow your tongue?
Okay.
I see him so clearly.
It's not a remnant, a shadow or something else.
And I'm not in a dream.
This man...
And all those I've seen...
Are they still living inside one for all?
It looks like my time has come.
So, man...
The power that has just emerged was my miracle.
Our abilities were mixed with the heart of this power.
However, the tiny one will not always be a part of one for all.
Crumbling in the flame...
On the surface of the rising waves...
The roots of this power are surrounded by developed abilities.
Right now, the heart is becoming more and more.
It has come into motion.
You saw it between the fluctuations.
The very essence of one for all is growing.
Why?
What will happen now?
Listen...
You thought at that moment that you would catch that guy...
In an apple...
I was trying to catch Monomo.
My miracle, the Black Whip, is better suited for this.
You were lucky that I was the first.
This is a good miracle.
However...
This miracle also contains another power, developed in one for all.
Now it is stronger than in my time.
Damn, I'm disappearing.
I'm going to be taken away very soon.
After all, only the spirit is left of me.
Remember...
You take advantage of the power of rage, and it will react to it.
Therefore, it is important to keep your heart in your mouth.
It is normal to be angry.
This emotion gives strength.
That is why you need to learn to control it clearly.
One for all was already at the eighth.
It is logical that now his power is incredible.
Listen to me.
With time, you will have six more miracles.
Keep your heart and master them all.
Good luck, guy.
We are with you.
It is you who will complete one for all.
Deco!
Deco!
Deco!
Sorry, did it hurt?
Uraraka!
Go away, it's dangerous here!
Don't be afraid.
Everything went well thanks to Silishinso.
Thanks to him?
Is everything okay?
Uraraka, you're hurt!
Damn, so I...
We are the art of Gunhead!
Actually, we are not finished yet.
No!
Fire!
Those crazy black things have ruined our plan.
You are just in time!
Guys, are you okay?
What was that?
You are the art of Gunhead!
What was that?
Here they are!
Get them!
Midoriya, Uraraka, how are you?
Now everyone is in the assembly.
Set up!
You will use the power of rage, and she will react to it.
Therefore, it is important to keep your heart in a nest.
I will not hurt anyone else.
What should we do?
We have to think too much.
What should we do?
All-powerful.
Let's wait and see.
Aizawa, what are you doing?
The fifth fight continues.
The fifth fight continues.
The fifth fight continues.
The fifth fight continues.
The fifth fight continues.
The fifth fight continues.
The fifth fight continues.
The fifth fight continues.
The fifth fight continues.
The fifth fight continues.
The fifth fight continues.
The fifth fight continues.
The fifth fight continues.
The fifth fight continues.
The fifth fight continues.
The fifth fight continues.
The fifth fight continues.
The sixth fight continues.
The sixth fight continues.
The fifth fight begins.
The sixth fight continues.
The fifth fight continues.
The sixth fight continues.
Shin, Mono, and the others think the same way.
We're going to fight to the fullest.
For the sake of our comrades. For the sake of victory.
Next, our show.
Don't forget. Always remember your essence.
Go beyond the limits, plus Ultra!
