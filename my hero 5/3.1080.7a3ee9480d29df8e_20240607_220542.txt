To be continued...
Dear my silly younger brother, why are you against it?
This voice... I will never forget it.
All for one.
I give you anything.
You just need to help me.
The choice is for those who have no power.
Mercy for those who sinned.
You didn't eat anything again?
It hurts to look at your vision.
I will not become the person you want me to see.
In reality, these rules do not work.
In this reality, you have not conquered me.
But it's okay, I'll redo it.
After all, you are so precious.
Yamero, stop it!
I found a power with which even your dead body can cope.
Let's use it together.
Stop it!
You're the ninth, aren't you?
I wanted to show you more, but you barely got to 20%.
Be careful.
We have passed the point of singularity.
But don't be afraid.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.

You are not alone.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
I can't sleep after this.
Midoriya, did something happen to you?
No!
Nothing happened to me!
Health problems again?
Maybe you ate too little cheese?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Maybe you ate too little cheese?
Maybe...
I'm sorry for waking you up.
It was just a dream.
But I clearly remembered the moment
when our fingers touched.
That scene at the end.
The looks of the predecessors.
Did you see the memories
of the first bearer?
Yes.
There were other events
where everyone was involved.
Tell me,
did you see
the memories of the first bearer?
Yes.
There were other events
where everyone was involved.
Tell me,
did you see the memories
of the first bearer?
Yes.
I shared it with my teacher,
the previous bearer,
and she told me about the predecessors.
That's why
I can see
what you saw.
I saw the moment
of the miracle.
But then the first one said
that I barely got to 20 percent
and something about the singularity point.
He was talking to me.
I didn't give much importance
to the introduction
during the sports festival.
But these things are connected.
The bearer talked to the boy himself.
I don't remember that.
And I told you
the teacher's version.
So far, only one thing is clear.
You are the first one with whom this happened.
It was not a dream.
It was the remains.
Remains?
Teacher, what do you mean?
Apparently, this miracle
keeps the memories of the bearer in itself.
The desire to do
this or that.
The decision to become
this or that.
Strength always
arises from feelings.
If you grow them,
they will become
a part of this power.
I believe in it.
It's like some kind of mystic.
An incredible dream.
Even if we die one day,
we can meet
one for all.
An incredible dream.
All-powerful!
All-powerful!
You say, one for all
worked by itself?
Didn't you get hurt?
No, everything went well.
That's good.
It became known to us
that the patterns in the memory of the miracle changed.
But nothing is clear.
And what about the singularity?
Perhaps this is a reference
to the theory of the ship's day
or the concept of the miracle.
Passing on the inheritance,
the miracles are mixed
and evolved through many generations.
According to this theory,
the power of the miracle
will one day grow so much
that it will no longer be possible to control it.
And then the bearer
will not stand it.
It's still unclear
what served as the cause
in your case,
if it's not the influence from the outside.
Anything else?
I remember
that I couldn't see
the two ends.
They were blurred so much.
Maybe it's because
I'm still
a bearer?
I'm sorry.
I can't help you with anything.
However, this power
is definitely on your side.
So keep investigating it.
Yes, I'll try.
Oh, right.
About your teacher.
She looks like a teacher.
What? My mom?
Yes, with a hairstyle
and other features.
With a hairstyle?
A beautiful woman.
Tell me,
do you have a combat training next?
Run and get ready.
Yeah.
I'm also present.
It will be fun.
Hey, you two.
I see you work as usual.
Aizawa!
You don't understand!
He came to me himself!
The more you justify yourself,
the more suspicious you are.
Well, what are you really?
Shinto!
So you just
went to Aizawa's teacher?
Kind of.
Hurry up and start
warming up, Midoriya.
The day will be hot.
Yes, sir!
Finally, the time has come.
Don't you want to sit down too?
Listen,
aren't you cold, Hagakure?
Very cold!
Look at my half-sleeve.
Isn't it cool?
Yes, it's really cold today.
All our guys
have already modernized their costumes.
What have you done?
Ida, I'm amazed
how you didn't get hot in this armor in the summer.
Even Kachan changed his clothes.
What are you doing there?
If you need something, tell me in person.
Smart asses!
Do you really have a built-in heater in your costume?
This is to keep your hands always
sweaty.
Don't lick yourself!
Midoriya, your costume
has changed the most.
You've added a lot.
I'm developing my magic.
The gloves fit perfectly.
Although this is the second version.
Hatsume made them even more effective.
Oh, that's right.
Calm down!
Hey, hey,
just look at it.
Have fun as if you
went on a picnic.
Are we an empty place for you?
Are you surprised?
I've already missed you.
Yes, that's right.
I'm in a hurry to get ready.
The winds of luck are blowing in our direction.
Get ready,
class!
Today we will decide who is stronger.
Heroic faculty, class 1B.
Ayusezu Abase.
Kaibarasen.
Kamakiri Toguro.
Kuroiru Shihai.
Kendo Itsuka.
Kamorikinoko.
Shiazaki Ibarra.
Shishide Jurota.
Shoda Nirengeki.
Tsunatori Pony.
Tsuburaba Kosei.
Tetsu Tetsu Tetsu Tetsu.
Tokage Setsuna.
Fukidashi Manga.
Henuki Juzo.
Bondo Kojuro.
Monamaneito.
Yanagireiko.
Rin Hiryu.
Look at the survey.
It's from the school festival.
I asked people to find out
who was cooler, our class or yours.
Did you see?
We are ahead by two votes.
From the very beginning
you stole all the attention.
But now the times are changing.
Seriously?
I didn't even know there was a survey.
And now the moment has come.
Class A versus Class B.
The first joint training.
Shut up.
Monamaneito.
Today we have a special contestant.
Try not to be embarrassed.
A special contestant?
Shut up.
I hope it's a girl.
Let's go all out.
He wants to transfer to us.
Shinsa Hitoshi.
Class B.
Our special contestant
will be Shinsa Hitoshi
who wants to transfer
to the Heroic Faculty.
He finally made up his mind.
Hey, he's got a bandage
like Izawe's teacher.
What an unusual mask.
Good luck.
He obeys those
who will answer him, right?
You'll get it and that's it.
Well, as far as I remember,
Midoriya himself got out of control.
Well, that was an accident.
Maybe Shinsa's mind control
has awakened in me
the remnants of one and all?
Or did it just coincide so well?
Shinsa, can you say a few words?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Can you say a few words?
Come on, Shinsa.
Your magic is mind control.
You can subjugate anyone.
You're making all sorts of trouble.
And no one will know.
Just don't use us, okay?
Everyone says so.
I'm Hitoshi Shinsa.
Some of you have already fought
with me at the sports festival.
But one fight doesn't make us friends.
Unfortunately, I don't have
such a sporty spirit in me.
You're already far ahead of me,
but I really want to catch up with you.
Someone so gifted won't understand.
You were born with a good magic.
You'll achieve your goal.
I want to become a hero
who uses his magic for good.
There are obstacles that I have to overcome.
I'm not going to make friends.
Nice to meet you.
Oh, that's the mood.
We need to get together.
Just like in the first parts of Rocky.
You think so?
Not bad.
Well, let's get started.
Let's start the training.
The battle will be between classes A and B.
The place of action will be the Hama area.
The fights will take place in groups of four by four.
Four by four? That will be interesting.
Yeah.
Forty-one participants, including Shinsa.
We have an odd number.
How will you divide?
Shinsa takes part twice.
One time for each of the classes.
Otherwise, two fights will be
four by five.
Well, that's not fair.
In the end, it may not be fair.
For a team with an inexperienced Shinsa,
an extra person can be a plus,
and can be a minus.
The situation is as follows.
The heroes try to surround
and tie a group of villains.
Your rivals are villains.
You catch the four of them,
you win.
Well, yes, villains
can cooperate sometimes.
It's simple and understandable.
Are we heroes or villains?
How to behave?
Why not stay heroes?
At the base,
each of the teams has a super cute prison.
Throw the enemy behind the bars
and the capture will be counted.
Are you kidding?
It's better to fight as far as possible
from the enemy base.
Although it's unlikely it will be so easy.
Catching the four
is a minus.
Yes.
A team with an inexperienced fifth person
can lose even if
they don't participate in the fight.
So you want to put a ballast on us?
What do you have?
Listen, let's make it easier.
It's okay, I'm not offended by the truth.
And this one has already made up his mind
with what's going on.
So, let's pull the reins.
Pull the reins.
You'll be the fifth in the two teams.
Don't be afraid,
we'll make it.
We'll make it.
Tell us about your magic.
You are definitely popular,
aren't you?
I can see that.
I'm glad to work with you.
I'm glad to work with you.
I'm glad to work with you.
I'm glad to work with you.
I can see that.
I'm glad to work with you.
Excellent! Great!
Let's mix the classes with the dirt.
Please don't pay attention to his words.
I'm glad to work with you.
I'm so glad!
Class B, team five.
Is this going to be his first revenge
against you since the sports festival?
Yes.
I still haven't figured out
the secrets of the remnants of one of them.
But now...
I'm going to work with his magic.
Where did you get the notebook?
I finally got
to the starting line.
Let's start at the base.
20 minutes to capture.
If no one catches the four of them,
we'll give the victory to the one
who has more left.
Oh, the almighty midnight!
Is it really a date?
Stop it, I'm younger.
Who are you going to bet on?
Let me think.
The class has become much stronger
after going through so much trouble.
However,
judging by the estimates,
Class B has gone all the way up.
Perhaps because
they didn't get rid of them all the time.
Their development is more consistent.
The class has grown
in critical situations.
And Class B,
which follows the training program,
is much stronger.
Let's see what comes out.
So, the first fight!
What's already in your taste?
Let's start!
We know the abilities of the enemies,
but it's better not to split up
and crush them with numbers.
Camouflage, bitch.
You can see it if you know where to look.
I'm just going to go
and hit them with numbers.
You won't make it.
They'll hit you earlier.
It's better not to.
Well, yes.
Your shodzaki has landings.
Her charm is just a waste.
I couldn't get to her
and lost.
First, let's neutralize the most dangerous.
You got it too, Shinsu!
Anyone would understand.
Huh?
Just like we think
about capturing Ibaras,
they can quite well
plan to build a Kaminaria.
And besides,
despite their inexperience,
Shinsu is a great threat to them.
People, I'm counting on you!
We need to create conditions
to use our skills.
Thank you.
Hey, did you find her?
Where are they?
Shodzaki is on our left.
There's no one nearby.
She's releasing her lances in all directions.
I wouldn't want to attack a girl, but...
Ryo of Anger!
Kirishima!
Suyo!
We've learned that Kodo
will start looking for us with birds.
And that your first target
will be Shodzaki.
By the time you get to her,
I'll be right in front of you.
If you had time,
we would have greatly lowered our chances for victory.
That's why we decided to attack right away.
I've been following you by smell!
Shishida Jurota,
a monster,
turns into a monster,
increasing physical abilities
and feelings.
But in this form,
he often flies off the coils.
You're not going to shoot
right next to your friends,
Denki Kaminari!
I've come up with a new technique!
Air prison!
Soundproof camera!
Great!
Get rid of them, Shishida!
I'm coming!
That's it, guys!
The subduction worked!
That bastard
spoke with my voice!
But his mask...
These are the second connections
of Kodo's voice change.
Shishida!
Shishida!
Shishida!
Shishida!
Shishida!
Shishida!
Shishida!
Shishida!
Shishida!
Shishida!
Shishida!
Shishida!
Shishida!
Shishida!
Shishida!
Shishida!
Shishida!
Shishida!
Shishida!
Shishida!
Shishida!
Shishida!
Shishida!
Shishida!
Shishida!
Shishida!
Shishida!
Shishida!
Shishida!
Shishida!
Shishida!
Shishida!
Shishida!
Shishida!
Shishida!
Shishida!
Shishida!
Shishida!
Shishida!
Shishida!
Class A and Class B have finally begun to improve their skills by training, but Class B, which has improved their skills by training, is starting to push Class A more and more.
Next! You can do it, Shinzo!
Shinzo's new technique, voice change, controls the course of the fight.
Go beyond the limits, plus Ultra!
