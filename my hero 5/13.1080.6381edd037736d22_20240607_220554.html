        <pre>It was the beginning of a tragedy.
We had no idea what was going on,
and the seeds of destruction had already begun to sprout.
TURN OUT YOURMusic
TO BE CONTINUED
The song is about a man who wants to be a hero, but he can't be a hero because he can't be a hero because he can't be a hero because he can't be a hero because he can't be a hero because he can't be a hero because he can't be a hero because he can't be a hero because he can't be a hero because he can't be a hero because he can't be a hero because he can't be a hero because he can't be a hero because he can't be a hero because he can't be a hero because he can't be a hero because he can't be a hero because he can't be a hero because he can't be a hero because he can't be a hero because he can't be a hero because he can't be a hero because he can't be a hero because he can't be a hero because he can't be a hero because he can't be a hero because he can't be a hero because he can't be a hero because he can't be a hero because he can't be a hero
because he can't be a hero because he can't be a hero came the
that's not enough security
You're such a moron.
Of course not!
Flaming Waves!
The work on the level is in half an hour after getting the license.
Today we have two students on the show who were forced by the villains to step back.
Please welcome Todoroki Shota and Bakugo Katsuki from Class 1A of the Heroic Faculty.
Tell me, do you usually like to study together?
Why, does it look like that?
You should go to the cocculist.
We're friends.
What?
Don't be silly.
How long have we been friends?
We spent time together on the courses.
And what kind of system is that?
Time spent together doesn't make us friends.
What do you mean, system?
No idea!
You too, it's time for you to think!
It was the end of December.
There were a few days left until the end of the semester.
Tell me, do you usually like to study together?
We're friends.
Aren't you scared?
No, I acted calmly, just like I was taught.
Now it's Todoroki's turn.
The interview took an hour.
And Bakugo didn't give a single answer.
Only a piece of his head.
My answer!
That's how they defended him.
That was the third interview.
He got a license and earned himself fame.
Newly appointed, but reliable heroes.
I hope they'll be able to work as professionals soon.
So that the tragedy in Deku doesn't happen again.
Nine days have passed since the incident.
There were only 20 people in the riot.
It destroyed the city of Deku in 50 minutes.
They say it's still worse than Kamino.
It's a little crowded and less victims.
Maybe the criminals made it worse
to make people's opinions about the heroes worse.
Let's listen to them.
It's stupid to blame Deku for the heroes.
They should reconsider their system.
Reset the production business?
That's what they say only after.
Let the heroes work harder.
We're trying, and you're trying too.
Let's ask our commentator Kuroishiso's opinion.
Earlier, after so many destructions,
everyone around started blaming the heroes.
But now, as it seems to me,
we're in a critical position.
The Cores are gradually turning into support.
After that guy, look,
people started looking at things differently.
Look!
He's risking his life to save us!
And that's all thanks to the hard work of the hard workers!
Don't be too happy.
Maybe something's gotten better.
But behind the scenes,
there's an extraordinary situation.
It seems to me that when you support those
who will definitely win,
you pray for their victory.
Recently, the heroes were a show business.
And people are waiting for true heroes.
The Cores?
We've invited her for a consultation.
Since you're now more often in front of everyone.
The full night has also come.
I'm actually not at all in sight.
Next time, it will definitely work out.
Not for me to say, of course.
But she's a model of show business here.
Come on, shut up.
We will learn to communicate with the media.
I, the Cores, am an active hero.
With high demand.
I will teach you how to behave as a hero.
I can't imagine what will happen.
But let's arrange a full plus ultra, people!
Yes!
Today we will be working on a hero's interview.
Nonsense.
Hero Shota, come here.
Okay.
You've shown yourself great, Shota.
What are you talking about?
Pretend that you're from the mission.
Come on.
Okay.
Shota, tell me.
What kind of hero do you want to become?
So that when I appear, everyone becomes calm.
How great!
If such a handsome came to save me,
I would have a heart attack.
What do you have?
Heart problems?
What is he talking about?
Charm.
Give me two.
And what are your best tricks?
Forging an ice wall.
Covering a large area.
And it prevents the enemy.
She has a lot of applications.
And also...
I have a more difficult explosion of flame waves.
What?
Is he talking about that technique during training with Class B?
Well, it was...
A hard worker.
The Fist of Fire!
The Fist of Fire is the technique of my father.
The Fist of Fire!
The Fist of Fire is my dad's technique.
The Fist of Fire! The Fist of Fire!
I'm not done with this yet.
I will strive for more.
I'm not here to discuss personal problems.
But if you want to calm down, learn to smile.
If you smile, you'll beat all the ladies.
I'll smile and kill them.
That's enough.
Do we have to show the techniques for the interview?
Oh, my dear students of U.A.
In fact, not everyone knows who you are.
Your best techniques represent you.
Show people what you're capable of.
The hero is constantly shouting out the names of his techniques.
Thanks to this, they are coordinated with others.
They warn of the villains and people trust them with their lives.
Her head was only occupied with thoughts about how she looks on camera.
It's not just about the mountain lady.
Now all the heroes will be dragged along.
Hero number one.
So, let's continue our interview.
I chose the hero's name, Ingenium, to continue my brother's business.
I'm full of regret for you.
I'm creative.
After all, I have encyclopedic knowledge.
I have confidence in people.
I'm Uravita.
I'm a miracle, not weightlessness.
For me, nothing in the world weighs anything.
You have to be soft, too.
The hero is in the area of ​​Tsukuyomiya.
There is no glory in who did not recognize the darkness.
Oh, what an atmosphere!
The strong hero is the red bandit.
There is no blood behind me.
Oh, come on!
I'll dissolve everything. I'm Pinky.
I'm the hero of the electric shocker charge.
I'll shock everything with current.
What are you doing? I'm not worried about you.
But you are better than I thought.
And I refuse to make such a mess.
Shut up and let's go already.
In the interview where you are alone, everything is not so bad.
I understand. You just don't agree with all humanity.
I'm sorry, Ippakuga.
You were cut out because of me.
Who did you doubt yourself?
As if someone like you can influence me.
I see.
Maybe it's better to teach Bakuga how to avoid the darkness,
as you do, Aizawa.
No.
Now he has to learn from someone else.
I think you're Deku.
I saw you in action.
That's great.
I'm so glad.
What do you think about what happened?
I...
I'm glad.
How did he manage to learn my statement?
It seems to be from the nerves.
By the way, he rarely participates in something like that.
Many of your techniques are based on the techniques of the Almighty.
Do you admire them?
Yes.
What a voice.
However, I don't want to just copy it.
I worked out the techniques so that they would suit me.
For example, the Delaver Strike.
I chose a staff that the Almighty had not yet used
to name the techniques.
And then I included a part of the other technique, the power of the air.
By the way, he broke down on the bottom.
The guy is clearly making progress.
But how does he feel?
A miracle is not connected with strength.
A new ability is one for all.
And the truth did not awaken.
There is no more presence.
Two weeks have passed.
I imagined everything in my head every day.
It did not disappear.
That man said to figure out this power.
That it is waiting for me.
I locked the miracle, but it is there.
And if I get stuck on it,
then I decide when to use this power.
I learned to hold it back.
Now I will learn to control it.
One day, one for all.
I will free a small percentage
that I can cope with.
It worked!
Yes, the construction is small,
but this is the first step.
And one day she ...
And what was it?
Do not be happy about such nonsense.
Good night.
Good night.
Good night.
I did not go to bed again.
Director.
Insomnia is bad for the wool.
What? I fell asleep.
Do not worry about me.
You did not understand the meaning of the word sufferer.
There are not so many records about the past.
Did you want something?
I have an announcement.
Very soon we will resume the internship.
Internship?
Internship at the heroes?
And what is it?
What if we return to the internship after this?
Director, you have your chair.
Yes, but it is best to warm up here.
Initially, we decided to stop the internship
after talking to the agencies.
We wanted to see what would happen.
It seems that this time the security commission
requires that the entire Heroic Faculty intern.
Requires?
We were ordered to conduct internships.
They think that there are not enough heroes?
When in fact there are a lot of them?
It says here that it is necessary to be able to work
with the increased level of villains.
This is clearly connected with the case of Deiko.
The League is involved here.
Apparently, they are not just hiding.
Most likely, the commission has found out
about some serious trouble.
And since they do not announce the public,
and they also speak in a hazy way,
then they are trying to hide their actions.
Kayama is right.
Their order to resume the internship
feels like a kind of message.
They can't announce the desire
to employ students.
This is unthinkable.
This has never happened before.
Nevertheless, the threatening danger
is the norm for heroes.
Let's turn to heroes with good achievements.
It will be a winter vacation task.
Tell the students after the meeting.
Okay.
Aizawa, I would like to discuss
another program from the commission.
U.A. has had a shared dormitory for several months now.
No one has raised any suspicions.
So, you think there are no spies
from the League of Villains after all?
Let's see. If the League of Villains
makes a move and nothing happens, then...
Director,
everyone who studies at the Heroic Faculty
has a hero's heart.
Yes, I know.
By the way, have you seen
what's going on with Midori?
By the way, are you coming back today?
It's going to be a problem.
What's going on with Midori?
Guys, you've made a lot of money
and forgot what day it is today.
All together!
Merry Christmas!
We're being sent to the internship.
I think we're the most busy first-year students in history.
You're both going back to Riku, aren't you?
Yes. And you, Jiro?
Merry Christmas!
Midori, where are you going?
Since you've come out with the Night Eye Agency...
Now they're in charge of the multi-legged ones.
Look, Midori,
I've got an idea.
What's the idea?
They're in charge of the multi-legged ones.
Can you see him again?
Yes, I thought about it myself.
Oh, Midori, I'm sorry.
I'm ashamed to admit it,
but we don't have time at all.
Deco, we haven't seen each other for a long time.
Sir used to do everything himself.
It's terribly difficult to continue his business.
I also practiced at the Grand Arena,
but he couldn't either,
so nothing is clear.
That's how it is.
We used to make a wish,
and now it's a must.
So they'll give me someone.
Why did you make a wish?
So it turns out...
Bakugo, are you going to the best jinso?
What?
I haven't decided yet.
Bakugo,
didn't you choose the hero's name?
They rejected everything,
so I wouldn't propose.
Oh, and what did you propose?
A deadly explosion!
An explosive murder!
An explosive murder!
It's like a kindergarten.
It's a wish.
The hero's name reflects what you want to become.
You're still looking only at yourself,
and I want to show you the world around you.
You'll become a shaman,
get a license,
and then come back.
I'm asking for your hero's name.
They're going to call you a bunch of people.
After the sports festival.
You can go wherever you want.
Now I'm not interested in learning from a shaman.
Don't you dare put it on!
Come on,
give in to the influence of the devils already.
We're going to have an internship.
People, it's a holy night!
Enough talking about school affairs!
I didn't expect this from you.
Okay, that's enough.
Mineta's right too.
Let's go eat!
Does Sakharov know how to cook regular food?
I'm late.
Have you already started here?
Candy?
Or life?
No, it's not that holiday.
Santa Eri!
What a beauty!
It suits you very well!
Go away, demons!
Go away!
No, this one was two months ago.
And Togato came too?
He's with his class now.
Come on, go have fun.
Soft and cute!
I painted the eggs.
So we have Easter!
Eri, do you want to pour something?
Yes!
It seems that her horn is growing again.
Yes.
She's happy.
She took your words seriously.
I didn't know anything at that moment.
I thought I would want such a Christmas.
And next year...
I sincerely wished for it.
Happy holiday is over.
And we thoughtfully returned to the question,
where to go to the internship?
Midoriya, Bakuga.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Midoriya, Bakuga.
If you don't have any options,
then maybe...
you can go to the internship
with the number one hero, the hard worker.
In the next episode...
We agreed with the Kachans on the suggestion of Todoroki
to go to the hard worker's internship.
This is your chance.
Midoriya Izuku.
What kind of heroic deeds does the number one hero do?
Remember everything well.
And use this experience for development.
Next, the hard worker's agency.
The fire of the hard worker will burn the villains to the ground.
Go beyond, plus Ultra!
