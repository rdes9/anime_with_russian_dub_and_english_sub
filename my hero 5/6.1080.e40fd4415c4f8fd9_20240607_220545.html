        <pre>You just watch.
You're having fun as if you went on a picnic.
You underestimate us.
Get ready, class!
Today we will decide who is stronger!
Heroic faculty of UAE.
Class 1A and 1B go through local combat training.
In the first battle...
...Ri Chudashinsu successfully interfered with the team work of Class B.
And Class A won.
That's it!
It's done!
Yeah!
Please go to the intelligence, Takayami.
Takayami-san!
I got it.
Dark shadow!
I'm here!
Report when you're ready.
I'm here!
Report when you find the enemy.
I'll do it!
And then the second battle began.
I'm going!
Everybody back!
The class B courier made the first move and caught the guys off guard.
But Takayami answered him with a new move.
With a dark shadow.
And now the advantage goes from one team to another.
Poo laser!
Poo laser!
Poo laser!
Turn on your lights!
Turn on our stuff!
Turn on
our things!
There's a salesman!
Got it.
Catch him now!
No way!
That's it.
I won't live long!
I didn't think you'd attack me with just one support.
However, I always expect surprises from you.
You expect surprises?
Stop right there! Can't you stop?
What? Mushrooms?
I knew it.
But Kenda is better than you.
Kenda was right.
If there's light, Kura-Ira's plan will fail.
Let's move on to Plan B.
I'll cover everything with mushrooms.
Phew! Now I can see my silhouette!
What a shame!
What a power of creation!
The whole earth is covered with mushrooms.
I don't see Kura-Ira. What if...
Yeah, Class B.
My little Ionomedotis is wrong.
Beautiful greenling.
Earthworm.
Grasshopper.
Grow, grow!
Let the world be enchanted by mushrooms!
Kamorikinoko.
Hero's name is Deva-Mak.
The miracle of mushrooms.
It releases mushroom spores from the body,
instantly grows mushrooms.
The more moisture, the faster and stronger the growth.
Damn, they grow on bodies too.
Just like in the horror movie.
Her mushrooms disappear in two or three hours.
Nothing will remain of them.
That's why she scatters them like that.
The mushrooms are even on the camera.
Annoying.
Plan A.
Kura-Ira will fall into the dark shadow and suddenly attack.
Their team will definitely send a dark shadow to look for you.
Because it's effective and safe.
Most likely, they don't know that Kura-Ira has improved the miracle and will capture the shadow.
Then you'll catch someone.
Easy to say.
Say.
What if it doesn't work out?
What will happen to us?
The enemy will definitely turn to the light to fight you.
And the rest will understand where you are.
Because of the light, the dark shadow will not do much.
Even if you can't handle it, we'll surround them and finish them off.
Plan A failed.
All that remains is to leave.
Let's move on to Plan B.
Help me, Kinoko.
They're all growing and growing.
God, everywhere.
The operation is in two stages.
They even predicted a fight with Kura-Ira.
I owe you, Kendo.
Guys, calm down.
We need to get together.
Bam-boom-bam-bam!
What?
Something's happened!
Today I'm on a horse.
Your bam-bam went just fine.
My heart was pounding.
Fugidashi Manga from Class B.
The hero's name is Comix.
Three Miracles of Comix.
It can create sound effects and sound imitations from Comix in real life.
Depending on the sound, different effects are added.
Bam-pyu-pyu-pum-pum!
What is this?
Yaoi Rose, where are you?
My laser doesn't even have scratches on it.
Pish-pish-fuck, pish-pish-fuck.
Oh, is that something else?
Pish-pish?
Damn, it's a seducer!
There will be more mushrooms!
They're everywhere!
Evidimka!
You're the worst!
Komori and Fugidashi saved Kura-Ira from trouble.
The team attacks Class A one by one,
from a distance,
smacking the enemy.
Here's the true power of Class B!
Go for it, passionate comments!
Go for it!
Two are attacking each other,
that's too much.
By the way, what about the sounds of Fugidashi in another language?
I don't know.
Deku, look!
I separated Yaoi Rose from the rest of the team.
Really?
That's what they were trying to achieve in the first place!
They separated me.
Why did they actually attack one by one?
We separated the brain!
Now I'll surpass you with my power!
The shield from Wolfram is so easy!
Itsuka Kendo!
The hero's name is a fighting fist!
The miracle is a fist!
Her fist becomes bigger!
The bigger it is, the more powerful its blow is!
I won't give you time to think!
Okay, let's compete in endurance!
If you use the substance of your body to create,
then you will definitely give up!
Don't stop!
It was like that at the festival!
Don't give Yaoi Rose time to think!
Overcome with your power!
She created a favorable condition so quickly!
Right in the apple!
And I said that she's smart, calm
and quickly makes decisions!
And I said that she's smart, calm
and quickly makes decisions!
And I said that she's smart, calm
and quickly makes decisions!
This is our Kendo!
So far it is not clear whether this is the right move.
What?
If Yaoi Rose was separated from the blue,
they could have made the wrong opinion.
What?
Yaoi Rose, did you come up with something?
But even your plan didn't work, Todoroki.
How can my...
It doesn't matter, just say it!
I think you are the best,
you are suitable for such tasks!
In the voting of the mood,
you are the best!
In the voting of the mood,
you have two votes!
One of them was mine!
Because I thought you were good in this business!
I came up with Todoroki!
I came up with something!
There will be a special operation!
Honestly, I've been thinking about this
from the very beginning.
Since they were afraid of Youi Rose, it was worth it to go for her in four, and such predictions are quite expected for her.
Youi Rose, you're better than me in magic and in estimates, and I don't like it when she puts us in one row.
Kendo, in fact, it's not like that. To be honest, I'm still an inexperienced fool, and you still thought I was better than you, so I won't let you see my destruction.
Since she expects this, Chos can make her way to victory. That's why My Youi Rose is better.
Momo, did you work out so much?
It's time to show it!
Oh no! A cannon!
It takes a lot of time to create such a big cannon!
I can't see Kuro-Iroh.
And I've lost the view of Hagakura. Maybe I should meet Youi Rose on the other side of the wall, or...
Don't stop thundering!
Mushrooms, mushrooms, mushrooms!
Damn mushrooms! I'll have to slow down!
Something's a little dry in my throat.
I can't see anything!
Youi Rose has been separated. At the same time, they themselves are hiding, surrounding us and attacking us indirectly.
They are strong. It's hard to fight them.
Kumari, Fukidashi, Kuro-Iroh.
We must find out where they are, otherwise it's over.
Oh no! A cannon!
It takes a lot of time to create such a big cannon!
Hey! She's going to die!
She clearly loves you.
Youi Rose!
Youi Rose!
Youi Rose!
She's going to die!
She clearly loves cannons.
Momo is going to shoot!
She's bluffing.
She wants to break through the wall of Fukidashi?
I'm sorry I scared you.
It's dangerous!
I'm going to increase the number of fists at the moment of contact.
Double fist!
So this is not for the wall?
She threw something!
When everything turned into a fight in which you are better, I realized that I would hardly make it up.
But for the sake of our victory, I ...
So this sound was not from Fukidashi.
Is it from the wall?
Is it from Youi Rose?
Dark shadow! Now!
It's ...
Kumari!
What? Speak louder!
I caught this ...
Aoyama.
Great! Well done, Kuroiro! I'm waiting for you to catch the other two.
I was praised?
The enemy team does not know that we are here.
So let's continue the attack with mushrooms.
Yeah.
Listen, Kumari ...
What?
Don't you think Class A knows about this place?
I have a thermal imager.
It's much easier to see with it.
When I look at the abyss, the abyss looks at me in response.
A lucky bag?
What's all that stuff?
Let me hold it.
Here?
Glasses?
And alcohol?
Is this for disinfection?
Look, judging by the design, these glasses are for you.
They passed on her intentions without even saying a word.
Guys, calm down. We need to get together.
Youi Rose.
Did you think about it at that time?
Were you thinking about it?
Tokoyami flew right towards Kumari.
You also have a guest.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
I was thinking, why don't mushrooms grow on you?
And you treated yourself, right?
Damn, where are you?
And I won't tell you!
When we find them, we can attack.
He's flying right at us.
I won't let you run and hide.
A storm and an impact.
If you believe in a hawk,
the speed wins the power.
The black abyss.
Inspiration.
A mushroom.
Kumari.
He's too fast.
Nothing will come out of this.
We need to get out of here.
Are you looking for a shadow?
Here's my cape.
Listen.
You can't move in it, so you're not dangerous.
Fumikage, I caught her.
That's right.
Two at once.
We played it out.
All thanks to the things from Yao and Rose.
Yeah.
Hagakure also won.
This way they can win three to one.
Dark shadow.
Take them both to prison.
Fumikage?
What's going on?
What's going on?
What's going on?
I'm sorry.
He's so bad, so I took him away.
It would be a pity to use this mushroom on the verge of defeat.
Go in fear.
He's going easy.
Baby, the chiller is ordinary.
In the close combat, Kumari can't do anything,
but she scares.
You're wrong, because you're just learning from Takayami.
Takayami.
You should have knocked her out.
Take this!
I can't see you.
I don't understand what's going on.
We need to get rid of Fumikage and run to help the others.
I'm worried about Takayami.
I'm worried about Yao and Rose too.
I'm invisible.
I'm invincible!
I'm sorry for the delay.
Kendo, you saved me.
What's this?
I knocked her out, but I still got her.
She tied herself to me,
and she clung to the cannon.
It was very difficult to walk.
In all her creations, you can see what she thought ahead.
I don't feel like I won.
You saved me, Kumari.
Of course, we're partners.
Kendo, Fukidashi, how are you?
You survived the miracle.
Damn, Fumikage!
You used that mushroom.
Otherwise, we would have lost.
I understand.
Class A is a serious opponent.
We have to win.
You're doing it in the honor of Class B, Kendo!
Hooray!
Yao and Rose.
I hope you didn't fall for it.
It looks like Yao and Rose have become a good leader.
I've seen so many different pluses and ultra.
Now I feel good.
They've been defeated.
But Takayami has a new technique.
Yao and Rose have been fighting and thinking ahead all the time.
Everyone has definitely become better and stronger.
You've taken another step forward.
One more step to the goal.
We're getting closer to the one we admire.
The heroes!
The second match.
Class B has won the non-negotiable victory.
4-0.
Well done, Class B! Congratulations!
Come on, scary comments!
Come on!
My congratulations!
Well done, Class B!
Well done, Class B!
Well done, Class B!

Good job.
Good job.
Good job, Class B.
Well done, Class B.
On the next episode
A and B, now everyone has a victory and defeat.
Ida's speed and the flames of the road will surely help them to keep up.
Good luck, Class!
Next, the third fight!
Hanenoki from Class B brilliantly responded with flexibility.
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
