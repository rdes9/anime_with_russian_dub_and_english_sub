Let's go!
Yeah!
What the hell is this?
Sister invited us for dinner.
What?
She wanted to see my friends.
I knew you hired her!
Now tell everyone we're not friends!
Kachan!
Hello!
Thank you for finding the time.
I know you're very busy.
Thank you!
You're welcome!
Thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you!

Thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you.
Thank you for finding the time.
I know you're very busy.
I'm happy to see you.
Feel home.
I'm Yumi, older sister.
During the internship at the Exertion agency, Kachan and I were invited to visit the Tadaroki house.
I'm sorry, sister. I can't do it.
I can't say that I've never experienced the same thing as Inatsu.
It's just that we have a chance.
Todoroki, I think you're getting closer to forgiving him every day.
If you really hate your father, then don't forgive him. I think it's okay.
But you're such a kind person. I think you're just waiting.
Isn't that what you're going through right now?
I'm sorry, sister. I can't say that I've never experienced the same thing as Inatsu.
But you're such a kind person. I think you're just waiting.
Isn't that what you're going through right now?
But you're such a kind person. I think you're just waiting.

But you're such a kind person. I think you're just waiting.

But you're such a kind person. I think you're just waiting.
The End
That's it, the villain is now under surveillance.
Thank you for your help, laborer.
Don't you think that the Almighty would have dealt with this case half an hour earlier?
No, there's nothing like that.
The villain is extremely cruel here. Don't take your eyes off him.
Yes, sir!
Laborer!
Laborer...
At the first meeting, I thought,
what a flame!
Yes, such a fiery, flaring, bright, blue flame.
It seemed that you were just shining.
Do you remember, laborer?
The day I lost hope,
I couldn't even bear the floating autumn clouds.
That day you caught the thief with a stone.
Then I saw you.
Since then, you have become my hope.
Seven years ago, I missed the opportunity.
You caught me alive.
The only thing that a person is allowed to do is to decide fairly.
This is the outcome of his life.
Finally!
Finally, this day has come.
What do you think I did first when I got out of prison?
I didn't even have time to eat.
I went to find out about your personal life.
Why do you ask?
Isn't it obvious?
To put an end to it.
Yes, laborer.
I missed you.
Your brother?
Didn't you tell me about Dori Izbakuga?
Stoia?
I wouldn't do it on my own will.
Stoia and my father were very close.
They always played together.
It all happened soon after my mother's hospitalization.
Her condition deteriorated.
Even Shota couldn't go to her.
But it's already behind.
Shota started going to her.
Our family's affairs are getting better.
Only the father remains the same hostile.
He believes that this father killed Stoia.
So that's why he walks with such a face.
I'm sorry for the sudden news.
No, it's okay.
It's time to take you back to school.
Yes.
Thank you for the hospitality.
The dinner was very delicious.
Thank you.
Give me the recipe for the Sichuan Mapo Tofu.
Okay.
She'll send it to me.
Fuyumi.
Thank you.
Thank you for being friends with Shota, Midoriya.
Midoriya.
You're welcome.
Thank you, too.
Yes, it's me.
I'm sorry I had to change plans.
Yes.
Tomorrow I'm free all day.
We can watch a movie or...
I'll teach you everything quickly.
In the future, in addition to weekends,
you will work twice a week if you adjust the schedule.
Last time it was the same with Uraraka, Kirishima and so on.
I need to prepare for the exam.
Todoroki, can you help me in English?
Yes.
It's called number one.
Couldn't you take a bigger car?
You don't have enough money for a free ride, do you?
What an aggressive driver.
How long have you been putting all your stuff in the car?
Since I became the first.
What?
Apparently, success changes people.
What?
What else?
What?
Natsu?
Don't stick your head out, kid.
Look at the road markup.
Shut up.
Or I'll tear your tongue off.
You have a nice house, old man.
Let him go.
And you?
Tell me, do you remember me, old man?
Seven years ago, I interfered with your rage attack.
You had a villain's name.
It seems...
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Amazing.
You remembered.
I'm so glad.
That's right, it was me.
I'm Ending.
I repeat, let him go.
I'm sorry, old man.
You should understand.
You have so much,
that I can't even get it in a million years.
I've been admiring you.
But I have nothing to protect.
I want to kill him.
I'm begging you, old man.
This time, do everything right.
You have to...
kill me.
Heroes don't kill, even in extremely difficult situations.
But on the other hand...
Nomu, you killed.
And I'm the same puppet.
I don't even know if I'm alive or dead.
So there's nothing to worry about.
Burn me to the ground with your blinding flame.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Hey, damn
You forgot something.
Kachan, what's going on?
I'll kill him,
and I'll save my father.
Touls
Play
Put your fire in,
しこしこしこうしゅうしゅうしゅうしゅう You must be able to give everything,
and focus on that fire.
ropriate those actions,
till the end.
It's winter and it's here!
Stajors!
Don't ruin my life!
Idiot, you knocked yourself out of the balance.
It's my hope!
Let's start over!
This is my chance, I'm faster than him!
It's my chance, I'm faster than him!
For me, you're still a bugger.
You've changed your mind.
You only do things from your side.
It's disgusting!
It's my hope!
Oh, no!
There's not much in life that can hold you back from being a hero!
Let me go, and I'll let you go.
Right on target.
Let go of my brother!
If you don't hurry to kill me...
More people will die!
Take this!
No more!
I did it!
It's the same here!
In fact, it's the same!
First, learn how to do two things mechanically.
I can do it!
For sure!
Until we're here...
nobody will die!
Just this week...
you could do it!
Your wishes...
won't come true!
Yes, you're right.
But...
You're right.
Not one of them.
I thought I was going to die.
Are you okay?
It's okay. You saved me.
It was you, right?
Thank you.
I'm glad you're all right.
Hey, you!
Are you hurt?
No!
It's hot.
Here, old man!
What about the moron Mumi?
I caught him.
That's not right.
It must be...
not you!
That's not right!
That's not right!
Damn it!
Damn it!
That's not right!
Damn it!
What about the mobs?
If you ask about the people in the cars,
they're all fine.
A complete victory!
Shut up!
Why?
What did you say, number one?
By the winter?
One time?
Faster than me?
I'm waiting for you to catch the villain!
Yes.
You did well.
You were able to
fix my mistake quickly.
You've become so nasty and modest.
Kachan!
You're upset, aren't you?
Hang on!
I'm sorry.
For a moment,
I had an idea.
If I don't save you,
you can already...
You can never
talk to me again.
What?
Natsu,
it's okay if you don't believe me.
But the truth is,
I didn't cheat on you.
However,
I ran away,
leaving all responsibility to you.
You can consider
that I killed Toyo.
You didn't cheat on us?
Then what?
You always said
that's exactly what happened.
You're waiting for my forgiveness.
You can't wait.
I...
I'm not as kind
as you think I am.
But still,
you came
anyway.
For the sake of Fuyumi
and Rei.
Fuyumi really wants
what they call a family.
After all,
I ruined everything.
Tell me.
After all, you're trying
not to lose faith
in the fact that you can
return the family.
So you're kind.
You're getting closer
to forgiving him.
But
you're such a kind person.
You can't forgive me.
I don't want
your forgiveness.
I just want to buy wine.
Sister,
I was so happy.
But
when I look at her,
I remember
how much
I have to take
and change.
And buy wine.
What can you do?
I came up with something.
Hey!
Stop it!
How can you be like that?
Stop it!
Fiery,
persistent flame!
Blinding light!
Stop it!
No, don't!
Don't!
Stop trying!
His trick
to control the markup
was enhanced with chemicals.
Enhanced?
Yes, the substance is still being sold,
although in smaller volumes.
Be careful!
It's the second time in a couple of days.
After all,
darkness never spreads.
He is the source of darkness!
The light from his flame
will bring darkness and destruction!
Maybe.
But the light won't go anywhere.
Guys,
thank you.
I forgot your hero name.
What?
No.
What? You chose the hero's name?
Tell me!
No way! I will never tell you!
Get lost!
And you will tell me?
Get lost too!
I'd better tell the first passerby.
Yastrip,
it looks like you really have an eye for honey.
It looks like someone
remembers me.
Maybe a hard worker.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I can hear you fuckin'
in sonic Lock mountains,
He hit you from the other side of the road.
He attacked you? You're not hurt?
No, Shota saved me with his friends.
Shota?
Yes.
Fuyumi, I've already talked to Shota and his father.
You're trying to make your mom come home.
In the end, it turned out that we did all the work for you.
There will be no more of this.
We will build a new house where it will be easier for both of you to get there.
There you will meet your mother.
The doctor says that she will be discharged soon.
I'm sorry that I suddenly tell you to move.
Wait, dad!
Where are you going?
What can I give to my family after all the pain that I caused?
I think about it every night.
I started to dream the same dream.
It seems that the wife and children are having fun at dinner.
They laugh at stupidity.
They enjoy happiness.
But I'm not at this table.
Yes, because if I really care about them ...
What are you going to do, dad?
I'll stay here.
If I really care about them ...
And if I want to buy wine ...
Look further!
The third quarter has begun in the UAE.
We are improving our heroic skills, passing training and internship at the same time.
At this time, Aizawa and Tsushima go to meet Kurogiri in the Tartar prison.
What is the secret of Kurogiri?
Next! There is no other such hero!
We could not think of such a sad truth.
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
