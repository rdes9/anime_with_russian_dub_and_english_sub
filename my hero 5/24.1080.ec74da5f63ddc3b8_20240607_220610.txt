I killed my family. Then I ran away from home. I didn't know what to do.
What am I supposed to do now? Whoever it is, tell me. Help me.
I was stuck in a puddle. I couldn't say a word.
What's wrong with you, baby?
What happened, baby?
I'm sure the heroes or the police will come soon. And I have to hurry to work, okay?
The denser the population of the city, the higher the probability of bad events.
Some are much more urgent than a lost child. Our society is overflowing with heroes.
I thought they wouldn't come after me, because this is my punishment for the murder of my own family.
If only at that moment, if only then, someone would help me.
He killed my family.

Yes you
have a tendency to destruction that is too strong you cannot control it it overwhelms you
and can be expressed in the form of this CÃ³rdoba No longer need to endure seen this no bad
What are you doing?
What are you doing in the street with a helmet?
I thought we would let you go if you were a child.
But no!
Oh, poor thing.
Why are you so afraid?
Just do as your soul desires.
Otherwise, you will only suffer in loneliness.
Suffering, suffering, suffering, suffering.
Suffering, suffering, suffering, suffering.
Suffering, suffering, suffering, suffering.
Suffering, suffering, suffering.
Suffering, suffering, suffering.
Suffering, suffering, suffering.
Suffering, suffering, suffering.
Suffering, suffering, suffering.
Suffering, suffering, suffering.
Suffering, suffering, suffering.
Suffering, suffering, suffering.
How did you hurt your children?
Do you wish to suffer forever?
Can you
show me the answers?
What can you do no matter how long
I don't know why, but I feel something bad, and it doesn't go away.
I can't stand it.
Then get the hell out of here.
Now there are so many Heroic agencies.
Damn, how did they get them?
Hold them closer to your skin, so that these feelings don't go away over time.
What do you want?
I'm sick of you. What are you doing?
It's so strange. I thought he lost his memory.
It's so strange. I thought he lost his memory.
It's just blocked. And so all the memories are inside.
The hands of his family members hold him as if they were covering him.
Having lost his memory, the boy became uneven.
Only emotions come out on the surface.
He is restless. Look, how subconsciously he takes care of his miracle.
But I am ready to accept everything.
Right now, the boy has taken a big step to turn into a symbol of fear, which is thirsty for destruction.
I'm sick of it. I don't understand why.
I'm so calm. It seems that no matter what I do, they will forgive me.
Congratulations. You held back your tears and clenched your teeth. You were reborn.
This is a gift. I give you two hands in honor of your new life.
Two? But there are five of them.
These are spare hands, if any of them breaks. With their help, you will never forget that day.
It's like holding a newborn baby in your arms or taking care of an old man.
And now show me what you are, Shigaraki Tomura.
Shigaraki Tomura?
Tomura is translated as sorrow, a sign of your regret and forgiveness.
Shimura Tenko was reborn as the one who will make others suffer.
And Shigaraki?
This is my last name.
Now I remember everything.
That day I killed my father because I wanted it so much.
From the appearance of my mother and sister, it became easier for me.
It wasn't a tragedy for me. I really just destroyed it.
I don't need a future.
The League of Villains can then say whatever they want.
And I don't need anything of that.
I'm 100% stressed.
It was supposed to be...
Redestro.
If you manage to destroy it in time, it's not a problem.
You're just huge.
I understand. It's very funny to destroy what you hate with all your might.
With the help of my power, everything will end.
I will free people. I will fulfill Destro's wish.
What is it?
The pulsation spreads through the body in waves.
Is it fear?
Although no.
After all, I can turn fear into strength.
That's why.
It seems that something held you back, Redestro.
Why is my stress decreasing?
Ricky, we live on our knees, hiding from everyone.
Now you will fulfill Destro's wish.
Revenge for his regret.
Detnerat property.
Detnerat property.
Pressure mechanism to increase the time.
Klaestro.
Stress.
At 150%.
That's how it is. Not bad.
It was close. Don't come any closer.
He hasn't noticed us yet.
I feel it in my hand.
It's good, of course, that he distracted them.
But he's too strong.
We need to find everyone as soon as possible.
At least once he woke up earlier.
We will face him now, and the league is over.
And I was just going to set that ice fool on fire.
Doctor, how do you hear?
Take us out of here.
Waves are a nightmare.
We're all going to die.
What, do you want to kill John?
What?
John has angina every time he moves people.
I don't care.
Do your best.
And it's a lie.
You can use them freely.
I try not to get too close to people whose location is known.
When you don't have an army at your tail, then we'll talk.
Don't you worry that Shigaraki will die?
He's the heir to all for one.
That's why he needs to be cornered.
I'm sorry, Redestro.
I didn't want you to worry.
We need to protect Redestro.
Hold on, Giron!

150% means it's like plus ultra.

This is what will rattle in my chest if I go away.
Do not be afraid. Look at it this way.
The life of people, achievements and hard work are all in your hands.
You decide to squeeze and break them or ride around like a toy.
If you have both hatred and joy, you will be free.
Let them all die!
Let them all die!
Let them all die!
Let them all die!
Let them all die!
Let them all die!
Let them all die!
Let them all die!
Your legs did not touch the ground. Cut them off so that the body does not fall apart.
Listen!
Listen!
Listen!
Listen!
Listen!
Listen!
Listen!
Listen!
Why did you fight with me?
Because you got into a fight yourself.
Redestro!
Chief Commander!
Oh no!
Commander-in-Chief!
The awakening has been canceled!
Oh, no!
Rupert...
Worse than that...
...is the senseless death.
Free use of superpowers.
Not to suppress, but to liberate.
Oh, great Destro!
If the one who forms freedom
should be the one to liberate,
then it's the young man who made the weight of history laugh,
who made the destiny of the Bloody Huss laugh.
After all, they limit it.
I can already see it.
This young man seems to be shining.
They all agreed with mine,
or rather, with Destro's pre-death wish.
They came ready to become martyrs.
You're right. I got into it myself and lost.
I was going to kill them all.
But know that I'm ready to give my life for Destro's last wish.
The army of liberation will follow you.
Nice to meet you.
If we were to work with the pre-death vows,
maybe we'd be eating sushi now.
You're the director of Death Narad, aren't you?
So you have a lot of money.
The tragedy hit a peaceful city.
A criminal group lured the heroes outside the city in a trick.
It was planned and planned.
But it didn't work out.
The heroes joined forces and began to resist.
The heroes joined later, when they realized what had happened.
As a result, many people died.
But they managed to kill all 20 criminals.
That's where it all ended.
The owners of Death Narad were also in Deiki at the time.
They were all in the same place.
They were all in the same place.
The head of Death Narad was also in Deiki at the time.
Riki Yotsubashi suffered a lot.
Although he had to amputate both legs, he survived.
Some people think that the use of pre-death vows
only made the situation worse for the uneducated citizens.
But most of all, it's all about the heroism of the people.
However, the tragedy left many questions behind.
They probably say that if you don't kill, you make it worse.
You didn't do anything.
Oh, stop it. That's how I coped with victory.
Dabi, if you don't want to, I'll eat it.
Come on, I hate fish.
Toga, I'm sorry.
If only you hadn't lost so much blood.
You'd be...
Please stop it. I'm alive, so don't do it.
Let's not do what others don't like.
Damn, the leg moves itself.
What's wrong with your leg?
I was bad. Don't hit me.
What? What did you say?
I thought you got over the injury.
There's a lot of you in you again.
It looks like this treatment only made him worse.
It's time to go.
Leave me alone! We haven't finished eating sushi yet.
These sushi were bought with our money.
The medical service, the video editing, and Toga's jacket
were paid by us, too.
What? If it weren't for us, this bald guy would be in the hospital,
not in this shelter.
Stop it, skeptic.
The chief, Toistra Destra, chose these people.
And his words are still considered Destro's own words.
Hello. Thank you for coming.
I'm Red Destro from the Superhuman Liberation Army.
Now our army will be reborn.
What's going on?
It seemed to me that all the Tomars' hands had fallen apart.
One of them is still intact.
It's a miracle that its original form hasn't been damaged.
Is this a signature sign for him?
I've always been sure that the Tomars' hands
are still intact.
My eyes used to be closed.
I was a prisoner of blood.
I was caught in the trap of their knowledge.
And now I see a new liberation.
This is not a retreat at all.
Shigaraki Tomura is the only one who is really free.
In the blessed Trepite, I have become a full-fledged commander.
I am the leader of the Togokyu family.
I am the leader of the Togokyu family.
I am the leader of the Togokyu family.
I am the leader of the Togokyu family.
I have accomplished my job.
Now the army recognizes Shigaraki Tomura.
He is the commander-in-chief and this is their second hammer.
We will go ahead on his way to liberation.
The Superhuman Liberation Army and the League of The Criminals
will unite under the new name.
Get ready.
I came up with this idea, Abendexplosion,
and the Superhuman Liberation coins.
Call them the new name, Shigaraki Tomura!
We removed the word of the villains, and the prefix above received a wider interpretation.
Nine people on this stage will become my assistants.
The teams are assigned according to their needs.
However, this name, no matter what it is, is just for the sake of appearance.
We do what we want.
You did a great job!
Would you like a drink?
Go away.
Gladly!
Rupert, we're leaving.
I didn't want him to become like this.
Hey!
He was so hurt.
It's a miracle that he's still alive.
Supernatural liberation front.
What a pathetic name.
I'm sure it's better than a cheap gang of villains.
Machia listened to me.
I believe I reached the minimum level you talked about.
Yes, you have your memory back.
You are the same as you were done and the same with the miracle.
I will keep my word.
I will give you strength if you crave it so much.
Supernatural liberation front.
What a pathetic name.
I believe I reached the minimum level you talked about.
I believe I reached the minimum level you talked about.

The next episode.
Shigaraki Tomura is now leading the liberation army.
When heroes learn about this they begin to prepare
for the fight with the villains.
The war is already set.
Go beyond.
Flussultra!
