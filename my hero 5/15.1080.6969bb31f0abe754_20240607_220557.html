        <pre>How's it going?
Well, in general...
I'm fighting against the spread of ideology.
I noticed you're handing out one book to the hero.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Let's open one book.
Not only did you read it carefully, but also understood the message of Destro.
Obviously, you're in the right.
Well, thank you.
But I still don't understand anything.
Explain to me somehow, okay?
Okay, it's not particularly difficult.
With such a walking ad as you, the ideology of liberation will spread quickly.
It will be great if we lean towards those teenagers and 20-year-olds.
I will work hard and further.
Listen, Yastrip, you're working hard.
You're doing great.
You're evil.
Work with me.
Thank you all.
So far, the commission does not notice us.
They study the involvement of the League in the events of Deiko.
The troops are doing well.
And we're starting to gradually train the new generation.
Seriously?
What a coincidence!
Judging by that day, they didn't get much stronger.
Well, yes.
They're just schoolchildren.
Thank you for your work.
You can go, Yastrip.
Don't show the slightest signs of concern.
The wings of rage recognize the type of sound by vibrations.
Now I can hear you.
This is definitely normal, Spinner.
Yes, the troops should not fall.
We're about to get down to business.
Four months and bam!
Our Omura will destroy everything.
Four months.

aluminum's
who are you?
You smash the room
trash
garbage
More than 100,000 in four months.
I don't know how many heroes are here, and what exactly Shigaraki is up to.
I can't walk freely, and with folded wings I can't hear sounds from afar.
I'm still not sure of any important information, but I've already learned the details, so that's it.
First, I'll give you a sign.
Is it really the Jester who is secretly studying the enemy? You can't come here.
What? I was just looking for a table.
You can't come here.
Okay, okay, I get it.
If we surrounded this place... No, we need a faster way.
I'll find out the number of the liberation army and its location.
We also need to find out the involved heroes, so that we can gather everyone together in one place.
Otherwise, we'll lose the enemies we don't see.
And the civilians will suffer even more, so...
In case of our failure...
More people.
Is that what you called me for?
Yes, that way the students will gain more experience with the villains.
And it will benefit you as well.
Please, study them carefully, laborer.
The commission and Jester already have some idea about the enemy.
They are working in secret.
So, these interns are preparing for this?
I doubted that, but I wanted to insure the students.
No matter what, since the laborer wanted to take only Shota here,
the other two will probably have to work with us.
I came because I have to see the work of the number one hero.
And you will see it.
Kachan, calm down.
I was also waiting for someone else.
I'll talk to him.
This is an internship to insure our power.
I'm against it, however...
Shota, Deku, Bakuga...
We will take care of you three.
Judging by that day, they didn't get much stronger.
It's good that you underestimate them.
It wasn't in vain that I stole the labors from them.
In fact, they would have coped, even if I hadn't been there.
I'm not interested in teaching the new generation at all.
Seeing your persistence, I changed my mind.
I'm glad that it was you who came to my agency, Tsukuyomi.
You are strong.
Your friends are strong too.
You are constantly developing.
You are much faster than me.
The heart is linked to the power.
But how to control it?
Criminals will never get what they ask for.
Then the sakura flowers will fall.
I hope we all will smile.
I will teach you.
However, first Deku and Bakug will tell me more about themselves.
Think about what you need to work on and what you can do.
I want to control my power and act at full power.
Your miracle is the power from which you feel pain, right?
Yes, I already understood how not to injure myself.
However, after that time, there are still secondary things, it seems.
It began to manifest in different ways.
Show me.
I concentrate and release as much as I can, and so far this is the maximum.
If there are fluctuations, more will come out, and I will not be able to cope.
Explain to me what it means for you to act at full power.
This flexible force is like a knot.
I want to pose a danger to a useful weapon.
So far I'm looking, can I control it like the power of the air?
Oh, you don't know about it.
This is a long-range attack with air pressure.
However, it requires more power than I can withstand now.
At the moment, if I don't overload my body, I can give out 10-15 percent, and for the power of the air, I need 20.
So, a little is not enough, and so far, if it is not an injury, then there will definitely be a pain that hinders me.
Therefore, I learned to release the power and immediately remove it.
If this happens with these black hair, then I can use them.
However, at first I work out a new force in motion, and adding a new factor is difficult to put in my head.
I learn to do everything at the same time, but so far I'm not doing well.
So long that nothing is clear.
He is studying himself.
Shut up!
That is, you want to be able to constantly adjust the force back and forth during the fight, right?
Yes, you got it! No wonder you are number one!
I watched your fight.
You have a great miracle.
Such pressure from a simple click of your fingers.
From the point of view of strength, you can be compared to the Almighty.
You also had problems with the miracle.
You were exactly the same as we are.
Next, what do you want?
I came to find out what I am capable of.
How much pathos!
Shut up! And why are you even sticking out here?
Where I want, I stick out there.
I actually asked seriously, damn it.
So far, I did everything I wanted with the help of my explosion.
Even with one single miracle, I can become the strongest.
I can become the strongest.
But I found out that there is simply not enough strength to become truly strong.
I came to find out what I lack to surpass the number one hero.
Interesting guy.
Great.
Then let's go.
I haven't answered yet.
What? You came to learn the fist of fire?
I turned to the methods that you used on me in childhood.
This is for my right side.
Now I understand that before my mind was filled with senseless hatred for you.
I came to visit you.
I studied in Yoy.
Time with them and the competition opened my eyes.
Effort.
In the end, I do what you wanted.
Yes, now that's enough.
But soon you will reach the limit.
Come work for me after graduation.
I will guide you on the path of power.
Just remember one thing.
My idol.
The man we watched on TV with my mother.
I came here as an inexperienced youngster to become a worthy name for the hero.
I came at my own will.
I came to use you.
I'm sorry that I'm here out of convenience.
And there is nothing to be ashamed of my parents in front of my friends.
The hard worker has always been an amazing hero.
He is still the same.
Only I did not forgive you for how you behaved with your mother.
Therefore, as a father, you ...
Let's see how it goes further.
He himself decided to work here.
And I thought that he had softened a little.
But it seems I was very wrong.
Okay, I understand.
From this day on, I will educate you as heroes.
Rescue, evacuation and battle.
These are three typical requests to heroes.
In most agencies, heroes focus on rescue or battle.
And I believe that all three tasks are important.
I know every corner of the city and notice any strangeness.
In case of an accident, I will rush to the scene as soon as possible.
I keep Zivak away from the fire to reduce the number of victims.
This is the basis of the basis.
Parallel execution and quick reaction.
This should be the norm.
Parallel execution.
I have a lot of experience.
It is a hard work in the UA.
And here you will get experience.
Get as much experience as possible.
What you want to work on, get used to the experience.
I'm waiting for winter.
You can catch the villain at least once faster than me.
Stop!
Quick reaction.
Not that I'm in a hurry.
I got my miracle at 15.
When everyone was wondering where to put their arms and legs.
I just learned to use them.
I mastered full coverage and was able to control one of them all.
But I had to teach the body to use them reflexively.
Listen to me.
In time, you will have six more miracles.
You need to master them as soon as possible.
The escaped suspect has turned around.
Roger that.
He didn't slow down.
On the turn.
Damn!
Suspect has been caught.
Roman, you are late.
It's hard for me to warm up in winter.
Bakuga, did you notice?
What?
Do you think I noticed something that I wouldn't have noticed?
What did you notice there?
Shame.
The striker used his fire in a hurry.
Do you remember the fire in the battle of the spring?
I think he transformed it into this way of promotion.
I know this because I have the same miracle.
A huge speed at high temperature.
And you still need to control the flame.
He copies my explosion.
And you noticed it only now?
Yes.
It took me a long time.
I'll add something else.
There is a wide road ahead.
I got it.
The striker blocked the path with the fire he scared the suspect.
Forward!
We'll sort it out here.
Guys, usually he doesn't teach anyone anything except shot.
So keep that in mind.
We'll catch up with you.
The fire is like a means of promotion.
Control!
Are you going to work with your partners?
In Kyusyu, we shared responsibilities with the striker.
But ordinary heroes should be able to cope on their own.
By the way, that day I noticed a hand-made glass villain.
I'm sick of it!
Kacham!
Bakugo!
Do you want to know what you're capable of?
Yes, you move fast.
You're good.
But only for a newcomer.
However, you just saw that you can't beat me.
And if you can't do it, will you justify yourself?
This is not a lesson for you.
If you can't do it, you'll lose not a point at all, but a man.
Are you okay?
Yes.
Shota, Bakugo, you two will have one homework.
Why do you always unite me?
This is related to the study of the fire fist.
Save and set it on fire.
Concentrate your power.
You must be able to give out the maximum power at once and concentrate on it.
Repeat these actions until at least one of them starts to work out on its own.
Kacham, it's like your armor-piercing shot.
How do you know about it, bastard?
And don't even come to me!
You're already halfway through the game.
Start working out the accuracy.
You're already in control of the shape of the ice.
So do the same with the fire.
Deku, you know how to release your strength, right?
Yes.
Can you do it without thinking?
Yes.
It comes out with full coverage, but with the power of the air, you have to think.
So work on the topic to do it mechanically, and forget about your secondary abilities for now.
But what about parallel execution?
All people are constantly doing something with parallel execution.
Unconsciously.
For example, a person is driving a car and initially he did not know how to drive.
Turn the steering wheel.
Push the lever and the pedal.
Turn the mirrors from the front and from the back.
He was learning every step to be able to do everything at once without thinking.
First, learn how to do two things mechanically.
When you manage to do it, add the third.
No matter how powerful the force is, you have to be able to do it mechanically.
You have to be able to do it mechanically.
You have to be able to do it mechanically.
No matter how powerful the force is, the point is to accumulate it gradually.
There are exceptions.
But the rest have to accumulate the force.
Well, or it's me, I don't know other ways.
Although you are working on the same thing, school and work experience are different.
Take the school knowledge and let the body use them here, in the best conditions.
I got so much from the Almighty.
I went through so much while studying at Yale.
As if I was constantly being dragged forward by force.
But I don't care.
What's wrong with you?
Don't be afraid to fail.
Successes and failures of the three of you will not affect my work at all.
Yes, I'm moving forward.
I'm going forward as fast as I can.
Beyond the limits.
One step at a time.
Forward!
I'm going forward.
