It's probably worth explaining what the ocean is.
The ocean is a huge reserve of salt water covering two-thirds of our world.

Episode 9. The Attacking Giant
Episode 9. The Attacking Giant
Owl, who are you?
I'm Aaron Krueger, and as you may have noticed, I'm the bearer of one of the nine giants.
I mean, I'm also a child of the world, just like you.
You gave yourself up to the Marley and joined the law enforcement?
Are you all right? How did you pass the blood test?
I found a doctor who made up for my results.
Doctors are great spies.
In fact, you did quite well.
But no matter how you look at it, everything turned out the way Gryce said.
He was right in everything.
I'm a terrible father, a bad husband, and a disgusting person.
So why am I the only one who hasn't been turned into a monster?
Dina, she had a special royal blood.
If you didn't hide it, they wouldn't have turned her into a giant.
Dina, after all...
Explain why you didn't save them!
Stop it. Your fingers haven't healed yet.
What kind of care is this?
You didn't even care when they were cut off.
Tell me, why didn't you use the power of the giant before?
You could have saved all my friends!
Why did you just watch them turn into giants?
What's going on? You look disgusting.
No, it's not the first time.
I cut off the fingers of thousands of subjects and the world,
and then turned them into giants.
Even women with children.
But I believe that it was all for the sake of Eldia.
Time is short, Grisha.
This is your last task.
No one else can do it except you.
If it hadn't been for that day,
if it hadn't been for those events,
you wouldn't have aroused so much hatred for the people of Marl.
And that's why you decided to choose me?
For happiness.
Marl, your father, yourself,
your hatred for all this,
was able to burn the whole world to the ground.
I myself experienced something like that.
A group of Eldians organized resistance on the continent.
My father was one of them.
However, they didn't succeed in the revolution.
They burned Marl alive.
The only thing left for my scared child
was to watch the death of his parents from hiding in the closet.
At that moment, I swore to avenge Marl
and return power to the Eldians.
But in fact, I was just doing what my people were doing.
I turned them into giants and threw them off the wall.
I played my part with conscience,
but they still couldn't reveal it.
Perhaps I am still the one
who just watches the outer world through the closet.
Tell me, Owl,
what kind of task did you want to assign me?
I want you to penetrate the walls
and steal the power of the founder's giant.
You will inherit my power.
Wait, then I will...
You will become a giant and eat me.
And the founder's giant's bearer will also have to eat.
Why can't you do it yourself?
Those who inherit the power of nine giants live 13 years.
I myself received this power 13 years ago.
Owl called it the Curse of the World.
13 years.
She lived so long in the world
after she received the power of the giants.
I have 13 years left.
And you?
About 8 or less.
No.
It can't be true.
I don't believe it.
If one of the nine giants dies
and does not have time to pass on his power,
the power of the giant goes to the newborn child and the world,
regardless of the distance.
This is explained only by the fact
that all children and the world are connected in some unknown way.
Some bearers talked about the paths.
The flesh and bones of giants.
And sometimes the memory and will are transmitted through these paths.
And all these paths converge in one single point.
And its coordinates...
The founder's giant.
All children and the world are connected by this coordinate.
Who was the founder and the world then?
Marlits call her the servant of the devil,
and for the Jews she was a miracle-maker sent by the gods.
Some consider her an ordinary girl
who sought a source of life.
Nobody knows the truth.
Such is the reality.
You can make a demon or a god out of anyone.
As a result, everyone will have their own truth.
And the fact that the royal blood flows in Dina's veins
is also only your truth.
Unfortunately, Dina really had royal blood.
Then why didn't you save her?
It was because of this blood.
The enemy should not have received it.
Soon Zik will tell everything to the Marlits.
Then why?
Why?
Because the enemies would have forced her to give birth to children
until the end of her days.
Would you want that?
My mission is over.
It's your turn.
Only one of us can get to the wall.
To do this, you need to have the power of giants.
To be honest, I don't think I can do it.
You have to do it.
Look at him.
He was eaten alive by a giant.
You asked me if it was worth it.
I didn't like it at all.
Listening to his agony was unbearable.
I didn't understand anything at all.
If I knew what it was like to be free,
I wouldn't go for it.
Get up, Boris.
You have to return the honor and freedom of the Jews.
Get up.
I can't.
Look, I took her from you at home.
I don't want to.
I don't want to.
I can't.
I don't have the strength.
You don't have the eggs either.
The Marlites cut them off.
I have no more hatred for the Marlites.
Only regret remains of all feelings.
That's enough.
The main reason I chose you
was your decision to go behind the wall that day.
If you hadn't dragged your sister behind the wall,
you would have inherited the clinic of your father,
and your sister would have married and had a lot of children.
But you decided to go behind the wall.
Since the day I began to execute people of my people,
since the day you dragged your sister behind the wall,
our sins will haunt us until we buy them,
until the very death, and even after it.
You started this story yourself.
All nine giants have their own names,
including the one you inherited.
In all times, this giant was only going forward.
He always wanted to be free,
and he fought for freedom.
His name...
Attack the giants.
The power and memories of intelligent giants
can be transmitted between them by invisible paths.
What was that?
An attacking giant.
Did you say that?
No.
Huh?
But you said it.
You heard it too, didn't you?
Yeah, but it's not quite...
There, there.
What was that, Aaron?
It's nothing.
It's the name of your giant.
Why did you put it under your nose?
That's enough, Hange.
He's already 15.
It happens at this age.
What?
Something like that never happened to me.
Hange, I'll explain everything to you later.
Let him rest.
Huh?
What's wrong with him?
What have you forgotten here?
Come out.
But I still have ten days left.
That's it.
Hange has set a deadline for you.
Zaakley ordered you to speak,
so you're free.
He considers it unacceptable to arrest heroes
who have overcome armored and colossal giants.
And your commanders are just fools
who let go of the armored one with a beast like him.
But that's not true.
It seems you've lost weight.
Don't give up on food.
Aaron, how are you?
I'm fine.
Hurry up.
Get dressed.
Where are we going?
To the Queen.
She's waiting for you in Trost.
Dear history,
while I'm writing these lines,
Reiner is standing next to me.
He's trying to look at my love letter to you.
He's a terrible guy.
Girls don't like that.
However, he promised to deliver this letter to you.
He says it's a payment for saving him.
Forgive me for that time.
I never thought I'd choose quiet instead of you.
I'm going to die very soon,
but I have nothing to be sorry about.
Although there is one thing
that doesn't give me peace.
I will never be able to take you to my wife,
yours and the world.
And all these paths come together in one single point.
And its coordinates are the giant of the founders.
What was that just now?
Something's wrong.
No.
Is there nothing else?
No.
Is there nothing else?
There's no useful information for us in her letter.
Maybe there was some kind of secret message for you?
Or a code?
I don't know.
But most likely there's nothing like that here.
And the world was too stupid.
A real fool.
I never showed my feelings.
I don't understand why.
They're here.
Come in.
My queen.
My queen.
My queen.
Stop it.
It's not an official meeting.
You all had a hard time.
And I was sitting here waiting for your signal from the south.
Your life itself means a lot.
Yes, he's right.
I'm glad the three of you haven't changed at all.
Probably we just didn't have time to realize what was going on.
Let's start, perhaps.
The records of Grisha Yeager.
The full history of giants.
And the description of the world behind the walls.
No one except those present in this room knows the existence of these books.
Nine scouts brought these books.
They were donated by 199 comrades.
At this meeting, we will introduce all those present to the course of the case.
And we will try to plan our further actions.
Commander of the Corps Intelligence, Hange Zoe.
Yes.
The Corps Intelligence in exchange for the lives of Erwin Smith and many other heroes of this battle
managed to return the wall of Mary and obtain the power of a colossal giant.
However, the people living behind the walls are still under threat.
Everything would be too simple if our enemies were brainless giants.
However, in fact, our main enemy is the people, civilization, or rather the whole world.
According to the records, our race is able to turn to giants.
We are children of the world.
And one day we will be able to rule the whole world again.
Most likely for this reason.
The other races have turned against us.
If Marley gets the giant of the Founder, the Jews will come to an end.
The king of the walls will not allow this at all.
The king of the walls will not fight.
If the Jews repeat their sins, we will be ready to accept our fate.
I have signed an agreement with the Founder of the Giants about the refusal of war.
This is the message the king of the walls left before closing the gates.
Isn't he threatened to use giants inside the walls to destroy the world?
While the rest of the world believes in this threat, the people behind the wall continue to live in the world.
The king of the walls erased the memory of his people and told them that humanity died behind the wall.
He considers this tiny piece of land to be his paradise.
Can the ruler abandon his people?
Find the giant of the Founder and take this power from the cowardly king.
This is your task.
Dr. Yeager has achieved his goal and passed the giant of the Founder to his son Eren.
Only representatives of the royal family can fully use the power of the giant of the Founder.
However, together with the power of the giant of the Founder, the children of the king inherit his will, and they are forced to follow his will.
This is how the oath of refusal of war works.
However, once in an emergency situation, Eren managed to take control of the pure giants.
Even if Eren does not have the royal blood, he has the potential to control the power of the giant of the Founder.
That time, for a moment, it seemed to me that I felt a connection with everyone.
But why only that time?
My name is Dina Fritz. I am the descendant of the royal family.
Here it is!
You scared me. What are you doing?
It's just...
Speak, our giant.
It's nothing serious.
I'm sorry I interrupted you.
Yeah, okay, I understand.
It just seems to him now that it's cool to behave like that.
It's time to kill the elders forever.
Oh, that's how it is. I'm sorry.
It's a hard age.
Eren.
No one knows. Even these two.
I didn't say that the giant, who killed my mother and Hannes, turned out to be my father's ex-wife.
After all, if I tell them that in the touch of the giant in which the royal blood flows, I may be able to use the power of the giant of the Founder.
But this is just a theory.
And if I tell them about it, it is not known what will happen in history.
Start a family.
As soon as you get through the walls, you need to start a family.
What are you talking about? I have a family.
Besides, won't my previous memories disappear after I address them?
Not necessarily.
Maybe the next carrier will see them.
Wife, child or a simple citizen.
Love someone inside the wall.
If nothing comes out of you, the story will repeat itself.
And someone will make the same mistakes again.
For the sake of Mikasa and the army.
For the sake of everyone else, you have to cope.
Mikasa? The army? Who are they?
I don't know myself. Whose memories are these?
Mikasa?
Mikasa?
Mikasa?
Mikasa?
Mikasa?
Mikasa?
Mikasa?
Mikasa?
Mikasa?
Mikasa?
Mikasa?
Mikasa?
Mikasa?
Mikasa?
Mikasa?
Mikasa?
Mikasa...
Mikasa?
Mikasa?
Mikasa...
Mikasa?
Mikasa?
Mikasa?!
Mikasa?
Mikasa?!
Mikasa?!
Next, the world beyond the walls.
