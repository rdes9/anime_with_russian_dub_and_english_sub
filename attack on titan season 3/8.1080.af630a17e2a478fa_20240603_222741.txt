Levi and the scouts collided with the Kenya squadron in their lair and fought for the sake of saving the RNA history. However...
Everyone, step back to the last post! Regroup!
My dear history, in the name of God, what do you think of humanity?
What God? It's all just a stupid excuse for a pathetic manipulator!
I've had enough, and I won't let you kill me!
What a mood! Well done!
You're getting out of here, and I'm going to destroy everything here!
I'm taking you!
Father, Uri, Frida, be patient. I'll be right back.
One, two, three...
I'm sorry. That's the truth. Why did you leave?
Episode 8. Behind the Wall of Orwood
If the tunnels are connected, we can go through there.
Damn, too bad we don't have gunpowder left.
We can't let them through!
In this place, we'll stand up!
This is...
Transformation?
Eren!
They're coming! Hold on!
This place is going to fall apart!
Captain, there's a hole!
Army, Moblid, take Hange and get out of here!
Rot Reis, you bastard!
Stop it, history! If he's from the Reis family, then let him just eat me!
Run away from here!
Why don't you listen?
Maybe I'm the enemy of humanity, but you're my friend.
I'm not going to be a girl and I don't want to be a god.
But when someone cries about fate, I think I don't need it.
I want to prove that he's wrong.
No matter who, no matter where.
I'll definitely come up with a way to get out of here.
History!
Are you okay?
Mikasa!
Give me the keys!
Captain! Guys!
Koni, faster!
Leave me alone!
Koni!
Koni!
Koni!
Koni!
Koni!
Koni!
Koni!
Koni!
Koni!
Leave me alone!
Captain!
Hurry up and leave!
Shut up already!
You bastard!
The problem is not only in the giant.
The guys with the cannons are still here!
I opened it!
It seems like he's even more colossal, right?
The ceiling...
Watch out!
Back!
Hey, you bastard!
You ruined everything in the end!
I thought you'd better deal with us in the giants,
but you're nothing like that, you moron!
Captain Ackerman!
Idiot! Run!
Damn! We're trapped!
Why?
Didn't he want to eat me?
Should I talk to him?
No.
My giant won't make it here.
I'm sorry, guys.
I'm forever useless.
From the very beginning,
I wasn't destined to become the hope of humanity.
Bronya...
What?
Are you playing a tragedy again?
When did you manage to do something alone with us, huh?
Well, you're weak.
We had more serious problems.
It's still hard to get used to this.
Well, it won't be easy to deal with this.
I'll take Aaron.
We have to move fast, so hold on tight.
Yes.
It's useless.
We can't get out.
So what? Do you suggest we wait?
Should we fold our hands and wait until we're crushed
because we're the enemies of humanity?
You know, I'm tired of repeating this.
Aaron...
Make your choice.
I'm with you!
Aaron!
I'm sorry.
At least this time...
I want...
to believe in myself!
Aaron!
What's going on there?
Hey!
It's all Aaron's fault!
Aaron!
Aaron!
Aaron!
What the hell?
Let's try to get out of here.
Captain, are you okay?
Oh yeah!
What happened there?
What the hell is this?
And Gromadin?
He's twice as big as the colossal giant.
There's no chance of getting to the Wall.
Commander!
Go!
Eren!
Eren!
Eren!
Eren!
This is a proof.
Even when we pulled you out, the giant's body didn't disappear.
It's impressive, isn't it?
There's a bubble.
That's right.
Before I turned around, I drank a bubble with the sign of armor.
Yeah.
You used the proof, although it didn't work before.
And you saved us all.
You did all that in a second.
Yeah, the structure is poor.
But I think that's how the walls were built.
In other words,
now we can make a bridge in the shadow of the sea.
Both sides suffered losses.
It wasn't easy to achieve this.
But in spite of that, now we're moving forward.
The return of the Wall of Mary.
That means we can get into the yard.
But in fact, my father...
Captain!
We've laid out the exit!
Armin survived!
Hange Moblid too!
Great.
Eren!
Are you okay?
Thanks to you, we're saved.
But I admit honestly,
when you ran to that cliff crying like a baby,
I thought we were done.
Enough with the washing!
Under the beret, the rag is free!
I'm sick of it!
That's what I thought.
Let's go.
We'll find that big one.
Eren!
It's useless!
Back!
It's too hot!
Commander, we can't stop it.
This anomaly doesn't pay attention to us.
Enough!
Back off!
Now the most important thing is to find out where it's going.
Commander Erwin!
What's going on?
We've got to get out of here!
We've got to get out of here!
We've got to get out of here!
We've got to get out of here!
We've got to get out of here!
Commander Erwin!
Levi's squad is here!
Eren and Historia are with them!
Operation complete!
Erwin.
They're all right.
Hange is the only one wounded.
Looks like it's nothing serious.
Guys, you did well.
I've got something to tell you.
But first...
What's that giant?
It's Rod Reiss.
We need your advice.
Commander.
In any case, we don't have time to talk right now.
Let's go back to the blue.
Will you let this big one get to the wall?
To Orwood, to be more precise.
Most likely, he's going there.
To Orwood, to be more precise.
To sum it up...
In short, Rod Reiss wanted to get the Founding Giant,
the power of which is with Eren.
However, only Reiss is able to reveal his true potential.
Although, even if Reiss gets the power of the Founding Giant,
he falls under the control of the first king
and refuses to save humanity from the giants.
Yeah, that's pretty interesting.
And the first king thought it was a harmony?
That's a weird point of view, don't you think?
So, we still have a choice.
If this giant devours me, Rod Reiss will become a human again.
Which means we can still get the power of the Founding Giant.
We can't.
Sounds like it.
As soon as he becomes a human, we can grab him,
get his brain washed out.
If we do that,
we'll have a chance to save humanity.
By the way, Eren,
are you really ready for this kind of development?
Give it to me.
Eren, you can't.
But you're missing something.
Actually, the current plan is full of flaws.
First, there is no certainty that you can avoid brainwashing.
There is no point in holding it
if it replaces people with memories.
Besides, we know too little about how the Founding Giant works.
That's right.
Even if Rod Reiss eats Eren,
we have no reason to believe that he will return to normal.
Yeah.
And we know about King's unhealthy pacifism.
But it so happened that the Founding Giant was stolen.
That's the only chance for humanity.
Yeah.
Your father tried to save humanity from the first king.
He stole the power of the Founding Giant from my sister.
He killed all Reiss's children.
Just because he had no choice.
If you want to save Mikasa and Armin,
you have to learn how to control this power.
Father...
That's right.
Dr. Yeager, whom I know,
would never do such a thing for no reason.
Yeah.
Besides Rod Reiss,
there must be another way.
That's why he gave you the key to the basement.
What basement?
Oh, that one.
So, he was right.
Yeah.
We finally found a way to close Brezhnev.
So, there's only one way out.
Now it's easier for us.
I agree with this option.
But are you sure, Historia?
We can't let a giant like that walk around the walls.
We can't capture such a giant.
So,
we'll have to kill your father.
Armin, I'm sorry.
Huh?
There, in the chapel.
I really didn't want to hurt you.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I was really going to become a giant
and kill you.
Moreover,
not for the sake of saving humanity.
I just wanted to trust my father.
I didn't want to disappoint him.
Well, now it's time for us to say goodbye.
Orwood district.
Military department.
You were asked to get together in the hall.
The strategy discussion is about to begin.
Okay.
Historia,
I forgot to tell you.
You have to do something.
Yes?
This is the order of Erwin.
When the battle is over,
you, as the legitimate heir of the throne,
will become the queen.
Queen?
Historia?
The coup was successful,
but the people will not follow the military.
We need a story for the public.
A story about how the legitimate heir
returned the throne to himself.
I...
Listen, captain,
I'm sure you've heard this story yourself.
Well, in short,
leaving your father,
she finally freed herself.
It turns out you can say...
Well, again...
What?
If you have something to say, say it.
Well...
Well, in short,
the horses are trying to say
that Historia freed herself from the Reiss family
and finally found herself.
And now you're forcing her to play a new role.
Is that...
Is that fair?
So be it.
Now it's my duty to become the queen.
I understand.
Historia...
Thank you for your concern,
but only I can decide
whether to force me or not.
Well, probably.
However...
Captain, I have a condition.
Since this is my destiny,
I want to put everything on the line.
The queen has the right to hit this rascal.
The location of the Reiss family is set.
It is in the southwest of Orwood.
By the morning, it will be at the walls of Orwood.
I see.
Commander Erwin,
we all would like to hear your plan.
How will you evacuate the civilians?
There will be no evacuation.
Why?
All the citizens of Orwood will stay in the city.
Are you in a hurry?
