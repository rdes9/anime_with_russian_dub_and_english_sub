That day, humanity remembered
The shadows that advance in the darkness are not in the hands of anyone
The uncertain future is always a work of art
Every time the night comes
With cold hands, we gently caress our necks
Even if you betray your past
You still have hope
Even if you know that you're going to hell
If you want to see the continuation of your dreams
What can you do?
The devil is that chance-gainer
He's going to follow the path with a corpse
What's beyond that wall?
I've been longing for my childhood days
The truth is right outside
At the end of the corpse's path
The miracle of the fingers running through
Spreading wings
Even if you break your heart
The sun that passes through the darkness
Is still not sinking
That's why
We'll keep moving
To the other side of the waves
Episode Three
Fall
Protect him!
Even if it costs us our lives
Eren must get to the gate!
Distract them!
The Giants must not interfere with Eren!
They want to shut the hole in the stone
They're crazy!
They can devour Eren
With this situation, we won't get any information
Yeah
If we get there before that, we'll have to let my giant in
But if their plan works
They'll make a hole that we've pierced
It doesn't matter
We've been looking for the key to the puzzle for five years
And we finally found it
Hey, guys
What are you talking about?
What's with your giant, Reiner?
What hole did you pierce there, Bertolt?
Marco
This is just a joke
You're totally crazy!
What did you find?
Focus on the mission!
There!
The Giants are coming!
Eren turned to the Giants
Everything is in the Giants
People can become Giants
If the colossal appeared out of nowhere
And then disappeared without a trace
It turns out he's also a human
So our enemy must be hiding somewhere here among us
So...
Reiner!
Reiner!
What are you doing?
Reiner!
Again with your jokes?
No, Marco
You're just too smart
Help!
Annie!
Help me!
What's going on here?
Reiner's been spooked!
Help me!
He's been eavesdropping
We can't let him go
Are you kidding me?
There's the Giants!
He's coming this way!
Annie!
Take off Marco's UPM
Annie, come on!
Why me?
It seems you risked your life for Coney
Why are you putting yourself in danger?
Maybe you've already managed to get attached to these demons?
If not, prove it right now
Your father is waiting for you to come home
If you're different from these demons, then prove it
He's very close!
Annie!
Enough!
Annie, stop!
Why?
Why?
Why?
Annie!
That's what it means to be a warrior, Annie
You did well
Reiner, what's next?
Reiner, let them all get together first
Got it
They've been waiting for the Giants to get together
Wait!
Why?
Why are you in such a hurry?
We didn't even...
We didn't even try to discuss everything
Why?
Marco...
They ate him
I told you
They're definitely fine
They won't be able to torture her
How do you even imagine that?
You know, with our powers
one scratch will be enough to turn things around
And don't forget that we're not talking about her
She's probably hiding somewhere
Yes, she's slowly working out all kinds of blows
But still, how can you not turn her around?
Her personalities have already been revealed
Even not all of them are strong
Can't you focus on the task?
Here it is
And what about our deal with you?
You've already forgotten
If you want, we can do it again, Reiner
But with the next defeat
your armor will go to another war
No, I don't want to
Then get ready
We have one goal
To return the coordinates
and put an end to this cursed story
Let's end this
Let's put an end to this with our own hands
Okay
No thoughts about Eni until we complete the mission
I don't want anyone to go through this hell again
Let's...
Let's end this
Bertelt
Commander
The enemy forces are coming
They are stronger
My brave warriors
It's time to put an end to this
And complete our mission here and now
Let's go
Yes
Bertelt
We've already discussed this
But you and I will be in different positions
So try to think on your own
Yes
I'll do my best
I'll do my best
I'll do my best
I'll do my best
I'll do my best
I'll do my best
Yes
You don't have to wait for my signal all the time
Yes, I understand
Of all of us, you have the strongest ability
But you're too afraid of responsibility
I never really counted on you
Yes, I know
But now everything is different
Everything will be decided here, right?
Of course
Everything will end with our victory
With this attitude, you will quickly return your beloved Enne
What are you talking about?
Enne will appreciate it
If you run to her and save her from imprisonment
You will be her prince on a white horse
This is your chance
The same with Christ
We will definitely save her
After all, we promised the world
Yes, we promised
Good luck
Don't let me down, partner
I won't let you down
Reiner has been calling for a long time
Why is there no signal?
Reiner, did nothing happen to you there?
It worked!
We took his head off
The armored giant is defeated
It worked
Well, we've had enough of you
You finally got it, you bastard
What are you doing here?
Get up, we're not done yet
Don't cry, you killed him yourself
That's not all
Get ready for the next stage
Armin
We couldn't make a deal with him
We lack information
We don't know how to capture those who can handle giants
We had no choice
It can't be
Here it is
Signal!
Use the copy
Let his body break into pieces
This is Greek
Signal for Bethel?
Wait, we need to get out of here
There's a colossal one coming up
We're in the defeat zone
Hold on, Reiner, I'm coming
We've been defeated
Damn it!
Everyone, step back from the armored giant
The colossal giant is coming our way
Oh no, it's too close
We won't make it
We're almost there
We need to spread out
Reiner!
Reiner
Reiner
Alive?
Could it be?
He had to transfer his consciousness into a nervous system
But this is an extreme measure
Did he have to resort to it?
I can't believe he managed to drive you into the corner, Reiner
I have a request
You'll have to move a little
But if you can't
You'll have to move a little
But if you can't
I'm sorry
Get ready for the worst
It's time to finish
Well then
Our mission's goal came into our hands
We were kind of lucky
He's coming!
The target is at 12 o'clock
It's Bertholdt
Bertholdt
Take action as planned
The left side of the army is defending Terran
The rest will deal with the elimination of both targets
Yes, sir!
Wait
The army?
This is our last chance to negotiate
Bertholdt
Stop!
The army?
What are you trying to achieve?
Bertholdt!
Let's talk!
If we talk
Will you agree to die?
We have only two conditions
We need Naren
And the death of all people inside the walls
Such a harsh reality
Armin
It's all been decided for a long time
Well
Well, who decided that?
I...
I can't hear
I decided that
Your lives will be fought here and now
Sad news
I hoped
That I wouldn't have to listen to his screams anymore
There is no one else to save them from the bloodthirsty clans of the military police
Only you are capable of this
At this pace, she will be fed by pigs
So be it!
Do what you want!
If she really is in your captivity
Where are you rushing, Armin?
You wanted to talk, didn't you?
Do you think the talks about them
Will get me out of here again?
Well, I'm a soft-hearted Bertholdt
It's so easy for me to freeze my head
What the hell?
You know it yourself
You have no chance against him
This is not your battle
Damn it!
Armin, why?
I bit you
You're just dragging the time
The soldiers have already surrounded us
And while you distract me
The others are going after Reiner
Just look at yourself
You're just shaken by fear
You're not capable of anything else
If you're so suspicious
Why don't you finish the conversation?
I wanted to make sure
Make sure that when I meet you
I won't let go of Njuni
And I won't start asking for forgiveness
It seems
Now I've calmed down
You're still my comrades
But I'll still kill you
Why?
You still think we're demons?
No
You didn't do anything wrong
You're not a demon at all
But you still have to die
That's what happened
Mikasa!
Armin
Don't go after him
We don't know when he'll come
If we get closer
We'll be hit by the blast
I don't think Bertelt will come
Reiner is on the verge of death
The blast from the transformation will finish him
We can take Reiner hostage
And fight Bertelt on the swords
That's a good idea
But I think he has some kind of plan
Could it really be Bertelt?
It seemed to me
As if it was another person
Me too
Hurry up!
Armored and weakened!
Let's finish him!
He's lying on his back
We can't get him
What a strange feeling
The fear has retreated
And the look has become clear
I don't care how it turns out
I'll take any outcome
Reiner
It's not your fault
You can't fix anything
The problem is
That this world is too cruel
It's rising
Really?
But Reiner is too close
Let's get out of here
Hange
Hange!
Hey, are you alive?
Not sure
And you?
I think so
Mikasa, Armin
Are you okay?
I'm okay
What about Hange?
Bertelt was very close
Could it be...
We were the only ones
Who survived the explosion
Armin, what should we do?
Let's wait until the explosion is over
Armin
Give us orders
We'll go after you
We need to retreat
Let's go to the commander
For new orders
As planned
We'll start the battle
To kill the colossal giant
No, that won't do, Armin
We can't let Bertelt
Get away from us
We can't let Bertelt
Get away from us
We can't let Bertelt
Get away from us
We can't let Bertelt
Get away from us
If there's enough fire
At the inner gates
The commander and the others
Will be trapped in a cage
Then
We'll have to get rid of Bertelt
Right here
And we'll have to
Fight without any support
Armin!
The fire is close!
Give us orders!
Hurry up!
And what now?
Corrosion
Was that your plan?
To be continued
To be continued
To be continued
To be continued
With the appearance of the colossal giant
Shiganshun was engulfed by the flame
At this time, the animal-like
Hits a serious blow to Armin's squad
Next
Perfect game
