Episode 8
On that very day, in my childhood,
a cruel reality broke out.
Attack on the Titans, Season Three.
Episode Eight.
On that very day.
Get out of the way, you bastard!
It's the devil's work again.
The damn Eldians are acting like they're at home.
Brother!
Don't worry.
It's not the first time we've seen something like this.
Look!
He's on that side.
It's so big!
Oh, my God.
Have you come to see the airship?
Yes.
You're from the Aliberio camp.
You must have a pass.
But I...
I don't have it.
You went into the city without permission?
Do you know what that means?
Yes.
Is it a work or a punishment?
Punishment.
Brother!
Oh, you don't want to bother your parents?
Yes.
I made my sister come with me.
Please punish me instead of her.
Okay.
Brother!
And again.
Lord, be kinder, Kruger.
I'll take you home.
They did the right thing by not taking off the bandages.
Any Jew without a bandage, regardless of age, is going to be punished.
I have to go.
Wait.
You came for the airship.
I think you can look.
The next day, my sister's body was found in the river.
I took the girl to the gates of the Aliberio and went about my business.
Work is not a good place.
In fact, Eldian children are forbidden to walk around the city without permission.
It seems that your son does not understand what kind of people he belongs to.
You explained to him what terrible sins the Eldians committed in the past.
I understood that the man from the Marley law enforcement service lied practically word for word.
I caught him on the shore lying idle.
He was not so busy then.
My mother was killed in grief, but my father ...
Thank you very much for the instruction.
I will teach my son the right behavior.
My father clung to him.
I looked at my father, and I was increasingly absorbed in hatred towards these people.
And I also cursed my own stupidity.
1820 years ago, our ancestor Emir Fritz made a deal with the devil and got the power of giants.
After the death of Emir, her spirit was divided into nine giants, which founded the Eldian Empire.
After defeating the great nation of Marley, they captured the entire continent.
So the dark times began.
The subordinate Emir proclaimed themselves to be the highest race and began to oppress other peoples.
They took away lands and wealth, raped women of other races, increasing their numbers.
Ethnic cleansing continued for more than 17 centuries.
However, the ancient great nation of Marley was going to blow up the Eldian Empire from within.
They managed to take control of the power of the seven of the nine great giants and defeat the great war of giants 80 years ago.
At that time, the Eldian king erected three walls on the island of Paradis and fled there with his people.
Our ancestors were abandoned.
They remained to die on the continent.
The ancient great nation of Marley allowed us to stay on their lands.
Father was too chatty for a man who had lost his daughter.
He was like a obedient dog.
He threw himself to obey the orders of the masters and disgrace his ancestors.
That man lied to us.
It was unprofitable for him to tell the truth.
Quiet. All walls have ears.
I'm sure he took away Fay.
Shut up!
I told you, our ancestors did terrible things.
They followed the teachings of the Eugenics and tortured them.
What do you mean, Fay, it's not your fault!
We were just walking!
What did you find?
Do you want us and your mother to be sent to our ancestors?
Listen, Grisha.
Nobody cares that we are involved in the sins of our ancestors.
We have nothing left but to live in this isolated camp.
Pray for us, do not let us share the fate that Fay has inherited with us.
I wonder who was wrong?
Me or this world?
I understand.
Maybe we both.
I was stupid and naive, and the world was cruel and crazy.
I found my calling at the age of 18.
At that time, I had to inherit the clinic of my father.
What kind of a scar is that?
He proves that I am a patriot.
A patriot?
Your sister was killed by the Marley law enforcement.
The informant from the Marley government told us.
You have to find out something.
It's not true!
It can not be!
When I found out the truth about the death of my sister, I swore.
I swore that I would show them a real demon.
I believed that our ancestors did the right thing.
And to repair this world, we need to restore the Ildian Empire.
Our informant was called the Owl.
The restorers did not know who he was.
Look, it's true!
The founder of the world, having received the power of the giants,
broke down the gardens, laid the roads and made crossings.
She helped people and gave a push to development.
So the Marley wrote a story for themselves.
Unbelievable, Grisha.
You can read in ancient languages?
Not quite. I couldn't understand most of it.
Are you sure it's true?
Isn't that obvious?
I know this because I believe in the founder of the world.
We are the chosen children of the goddess.
Submitted to the world.
Comrades!
We have a messenger from the Owl.
Let me introduce myself.
My name is Dina Fritz.
I am the descendant of the royal family.
When she appeared in my life, I believed in destiny.
The last descendant of the royal family,
who remained on the continent,
shared with us the knowledge of the royal family about the giants.
This information gave us a chance to win.
I'm sure the king took the giants from the founder behind the walls.
Having obtained him, we will be able to control all the giants
and completely destroy Marley!
I don't understand. If his power is so great,
why did the king flee to the island?
The fact is that he refused to fight.
During the great war of the giants,
the king did not want to interfere in the conflict on the continent
and transferred the capital to the island.
As a result, our miserable existence began
from the moment the king turned away from us.
We must fight!
The royal family remained on the continent for the sake of the Eldians!
It's time to return the giants of the founder!
My friends, we will overthrow Marley
and restore the greatness of the Eldian Empire!
Hooray!
A year later, Dina and I got married,
and we had a son.
We called him Zig.
Children of the Queen's blood!
The time will come, and this child will lead us to victory!
Over time, people change,
and the world around us is also not in place.
For the restorers, the turning point has come.
Attention, Eldians!
The Marley government needed a subordinate world
to give them the strength of nine giants
and make Marley warriors out of them.
According to the owl's information,
Marley is forced to take these measures.
This is due to the development of military technologies
and the struggle for resources.
So far, Marley rules the world with the help of seven giants,
but their rule is coming to an end.
There is a huge amount of resources under the island of Paradis,
and Marley needs them very much.
However, 80 years ago, the king left a message.
If anyone disturbs my peace,
the giants sleeping in the walls will wake up
and wipe you off the face of the earth.
Because of the fear of this threat,
no one dares to intrude into it.
It turns out that the Marley government has the same goal as we do.
To sneak behind the walls and get the founder's giant.
How do we do it?
At such a pace?
Marley will get to him first.
If this happens, there will be no future for the Eldians.
No, we still have hope.
My son, Zig, will become a Marley warrior.
Got it, Zig?
What the Marley people are saying is not true.
But you, like no one else,
must obey their orders unconditionally.
The fate of all Eldians depends on you.
Yes, I understand.
I myself knew how terrible it was
when parents destroy the faith of their own children.
I thought about the Queen's blood,
about the hope for the revival of the Eldians,
and I completely forgot that Zig was my dear son.
And so, Zig decided to save himself and his grandfather with his grandmother.
In exchange for what he handed over to his parents
to serve the Marley law.
Although people living on the continent look like us
and speak the same language,
their civilization is more developed.
We have arrived.
This is the same paradise.
Right.
The Reproductive Colony for the Eldians.
Paradise Island.
Here you will spend your life
as a brainless giant.
Answer me, who is the Owl?
Please, stop!
I told you everything!
Honestly!
Too bad.
One more time.
We've already met.
I was a child.
Do you still remember?
As if I could forget what happened that day.
Please, kill me.
Don't.
Come on, move it.
But not the giant.
Grace?
Grisha, what the hell?
Why did Zig betray us?
He's your son!
You screwed up everything we trusted you with!
And the Restorers!
And Dino!
Is there anything to say?
I'm sorry.
Why?
We trusted you.
The Eldians are over.
Come on, Zig.
We'll let you go.
Grace!
Hey!
Grace!
Run straight north.
If you're lucky, you'll get to the wall.
The Elders?
Is this the first time?
We'll make a bait out of him for the new giants
to take them away from our borders.
He'll be eaten up very soon.
Am I right, Kruya?
Yes.
It's him.
The same guy.
He killed my sister!
Okay, we've got a lot to do.
Let's speed up.
Guys!
Guys!
Don't!
Stop!
It's Grace!
Are you blind?
Kruger, I'm sick and tired of his shouts.
I'd like to interrogate him again.
Go on without me.
Oh, you're so pretty.
It's a shame he was born a demon.
Dino.
What's going on?
Dino.
Honey!
Why are you here?
I told them everything they wanted.
She's from the Queen!
Shut up!
Is he trying to hide it?
Stop it.
Make him a giant, and we'll do the rest.
Grace, I...
No matter who I become,
I'll come to you anyway.
Oh, how lovely.
A pair of giants in love.
Dino!
Where am I?
Who am I?
Eren, calm down.
You're in the cell right now.
You and Mikasa are on probation.
Did you have a nightmare, Eren?
Yeah, I had a nightmare.
Did you ask who you were?
I asked, are you crying, Eren?
I think it was an infinitely long dream.
No.
It wasn't a dream.
It was a memory.
I just saw the memory of my father.
That giant.
It was you.
Dino.
Look, she forgot about you and ran after Grace.
She probably liked him more.
Shut up!
What did you say?
It was you.
Fifteen years ago you fed my eight-year-old sister to a dog!
I'll handle this myself.
You can go back to the ship.
Yes, sir.
What's going on?
The sergeant likes to have fun, bastard.
You'd better not get involved in this.
Kiryugin, have you finished your interrogation?
Let's do a little show.
A show?
I remembered you, son.
We won't make a giant out of you.
I'll make a three-meter giant out of him so you can fight him.
Why are you doing this?
Do you really enjoy feeding people and giants?
Why do you say that?
It's interesting.
You think I'm crazy?
But in fact, all people like cruelty.
As wonderful as it may seem, mortal life is forever lacking in something.
Maybe the breath of death?
You have to live as if every day is the last for you.
This is a natural state for living beings.
I'm always ready to take my own death.
And all because I always face the cruelty of this world with my own face.
The death of your sister was quite instructive for my sons.
And you do not dare to suffer the torments of conscience.
Well, I understand what you mean.
If something like this happened to one of my sons, my heart would not stand it.
I'm sorry.
You're not an Aldi.
Look, this is the true form of your people.
A couple of drops of brain fluid and giants will turn you into a real monster.
For the sake of the world, it is necessary to get rid of every Aldi.
This is what people of the entire planet want.
What are you talking about?
I do not experience the feelings of the people.
You are the killer here.
What did your restorers plan to do with Marley?
Does your conscience not torture you?
You're lying.
I know the truth.
The founder of the world helped the people of the continent.
You know how to manipulate.
Go tell your friend this wonderful story from below.
Enough!
Do not!
Go already, your sister is waiting.
No!
Well?
Is it worth the spectacle?
You...
I'm an owl.
Look carefully, Grisha.
This is how you need to get rid of the Aldi.
You're not an Aldi.
You're not an Aldi.
You're not an Aldi.
You're not an Aldi.
You're not an Aldi.
You're not an Aldi.
Look carefully, Grisha.
This is how you use the power of giants.
To be continued...
To be continued...
To be continued...
The past of Grisha showed the power of the giant.
The nihilist appearance of the human desire for freedom
turned to Eren.
Next...
The attacking giant.
