        <pre>Don't you think we've gone a little too far?
Well, they're not going to get around the city.
And why did I get you?
I understand, Marla. You just wanted to be alone with me.
Hitch, I'm sorry, but you're not in my taste.
What, really? Well, okay.
Listen, isn't that weird?
Why would a scout kill a civilian and run into the mountains?
Aren't they the guys who risk their lives for the sake of humanity?
Well, have you forgotten?
Remember what they did in Stokies.
There was no real battle there.
How many people fell then?
And they still haven't been found.
Her junk is still with me.
I can't stand it anymore.
But besides that, they managed to open the giant and catch him by some miracle.
Do you think someone else is capable of that?
If the scouts decide to disperse humanity...
Quiet! Someone's by the river.
Out of the way!
Slow down!
You're a scout, aren't you?
Like that. And no sound.
No unnecessary movements, just the fact that I...
Like that. Now give me your gun.
No sound, got it?
You can't hide your fear
Can't lie, my dear
Just like that
Dream
Change the life
Can't know
Just open your wings
That's the truth
I want to believe
Like a fallen angel
In the wind of time
Flowing away
Falling
Into the starry night
I want to believe
Like a fallen angel
In the wind of time
Flowing away
Episode 4
Trust
The capital of Mitra
Sorry for making you wait, Erwin.
We're in a bit of a hurry, but let's finish our interrogation.
So the scouts really did kill a civilian.
Am I right?
All evidence points to them.
But despite that, we can't say for sure yet.
So the military police is responsible for the turned-up search?
Hey, Puri!
I'm sorry, Commander Dog.
He's a newbie in our business.
He doesn't understand how things are done right now.
Don't worry about the military police.
We won't write about them.
And about the new UPM, of course.
Thank you, Roy.
New type of UPM.
These guns are useless against giants,
but extremely effective against humans.
This device is simply created to kill scouts.
Besides, it was even hidden from us.
So sooner or later, they can put us on the table.
In any case, they'll tell you everything soon.
Wait a minute.
Hey, you fatso!
You idiot!
Why are you following that stupid house?
Damn it!
He's gone.
Over there!
Don't let him get away!
You're Mr. Rives' son, aren't you?
What's your name?
Fleigel.
Pleased to meet you, Fleigel.
I'm Hange ZoÃ«.
As far as I understand, the military police are hunting for you
because you know the truth about your father's death.
Will you tell me what happened?
I've been away for a minute.
I've been away for a minute.
The old man was captured by the police.
A tall man in a black coat.
He killed my father.
You're lucky you're still alive.
Now you can tell everyone the truth.
How?
Don't you read the newspaper?
The people believe in the military police,
and they blame the scouts.
Nobody will listen to me.
They don't know I was there.
The military police sniffed everything out of me.
I have nowhere else to go.
All I have to do is run around in these alleys.
My life is over now.
Damn it.
Well, maybe so.
But you know, personally, I don't like this kind of life at all.
There's another way, Fleigel.
Instead of hiding all your life in corners like a mouse,
it's better to face the enemy.
Even if it costs you your life.
I look like a psycho.
Not all people are ready to go to that world so easily.
That's why you don't have the right to blame me for this.
So you don't want your family to know the truth?
What?
You just need that.
Of course.
You think you need it yourself.
Who's there?
Get out of my roof!
That's it.
You're coming with me, Fleigel.
No way.
Your ball's already lost.
You're not going to win.
What are you talking about?
From the very beginning, the scouts only knew about the defeat.
Change into the police and go through security.
Then find out where they keep Terence.
Are there any better plans?
Time is running out.
If we can't handle it, we're dead.
Captain.
So...
The Stochas district military police.
Private Marlow Freudenberg.
Captain Levy.
The real one.
Private Hitch Dreyse from there.
And what do we do with you?
Do you realize that more than a hundred people died in Stochas because of you?
Huh?
Tisha!
Maybe you consider yourself heroes and perpetrators of justice,
but because of you, whole families have experienced real hell.
Yeah, I know.
Hey, you!
You're from the South Cadet Corps, aren't you?
And Leonhardt is also from there.
Were you friends with her?
No.
I doubt she had any friends.
She was too grumpy.
She was like a child who was afraid of people.
I couldn't recognize her better.
Do you know why she can't be found?
Because the giant didn't leave her a wet place!
No.
Because the giant inside the walls was not Leonhardt herself.
Bastard, how did she get it?
We know nothing about this world.
And no one knows.
Except for the bastards who did it.
We'll let you go.
But first we'll get out of here ourselves.
It wasn't...
Captain Levi!
Let me help you!
I don't think your actions are wrong!
If I can help you eliminate injustice,
I'm ready for anything!
What's wrong with you, man?
I'm begging you, Captain Levi!
Not at all.
There is no guarantee that you are ready to start fighting with our government.
Let's go.
Sasha, take them and leave them somewhere.
Yes, sir!
Captain!
Let me do it!
Sorry.
Stop!
We'll forget what we saw here.
Of course!
After all, you're going to throw the hood away now!
But he promised!
It's dangerous for the two of you to let go.
I'll have to do it myself.
We're not lying!
We understand that you're fighting for the good of humanity, right, Hitch?
Hello, Hitchie!
I can't trust you.
Especially you, little pot.
Who in their right mind would cut himself like that?
There are always problems with people like that!
Hitchie, run!
The gun is faster!
Do you want to test your fate?
Our gun!
Let's race!
Wait! I'm really on your side!
Why would I believe that you want to be with us?
We're in deep shit right now.
Do you believe that such people will save humanity?
Then why are you...
Why are you still a scout?
Why are you still a scout?
I made the wrong choice.
As long as you risk your lives and fight,
I will trust you.
Hitch!
How do you look like a horse?!
Wait, Hitch!
He was just testing us!
What?
He was just testing us!
He was just testing us!
What?!
Hey, listen.
Weren't you afraid that I would stab you with a knife?
Where did you get so much trust from?
You reminded me of one good-for-nothing guy.
He's an idiot.
That idiot...
Didn't he tell you about Neumlea?
Fuck knows.
There's a lot of idiots around.
Fortunately, we're both no exception.
Marlow, you've proved your loyalty to me.
I think that will convince Captain Levi.
We'll trust you.
Over there is the weakest checkpoint.
Roger.
We'll go on our own.
Come back before you run out.
Yes, sir.
Marlow, Hitch.
Thank you.
Let's get started.
Now it's our turn to fight.
Let's get started.
Now it's our turn to fight.
I'm here.
Captain.
It's Jack.
Captain.
Captain.
Captain.
Captain.
Captain.
Captain.
Captain, it's...
From the Central Police.
I have a couple of questions for him.
We're moving out.
You're such a fool.
Where have you been?
You've run into the most desolate place.
Bastard.
But I'm your debtor, Flegel Rives.
When you disappeared without a trace,
it seemed to me that I had gone astray.
I even thought I was done for.
You're a good guy, Flegel.
Thank you.
Wait.
Why did my father get killed?
The military police did it.
What's it to you?
Soon you'll go to that world anyway.
I want to know the truth.
How did he deserve his death?
You don't know.
He betrayed us and stood up for the damn scouts.
Betrayed?
So he's going to kidnap the scouts?
He ordered the military police to leave the center?
But it wasn't our squad.
Looks like he didn't tell his dumb son anything.
What if he refused you?
Well, he would have become a dangerous witness
and would have had to get rid of him.
What a fool.
You see where he leads people to worry.
You'll never understand.
That's not going to be enough.
The old man taught me one thing.
A merchant has to trust his instinct.
I'm so glad I did it.
After all, I found those who will avenge their father.
And I will be with them.
What's the matter, Flegel?
You were running around here like a pig before death.
It's over.
Look up, you morons.
Commander, it's not that loud.
Well?
Did you hear that?
Did you hear that?
Detectives?
Where from?
It's not that crowded, is it?
It's just at first glance.
I'm sorry.
It's hard to call it life.
But we're still here.
We heard everything.
The military police and their intrigues.
All those present heard it.
So what?
The government decides what's going to be the truth.
Idiots.
Don't think it's going to last long.
You're all still alive.
People.
Don't be afraid.
The Rifts company will protect the city.
I'm Flegel Rifts.
I'm with you from now on.
So from this moment on,
go to sleep.
We're counting on you.
Say it louder.
You did well.
Okay.
Keep an eye on the police.
Yeah.
Stop it.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Where's Aaron and Christ?
What a brave man.
He dealt with the newcomers
who are even taken to the toilet.
Do you think they've done a great deed?
Our action is disgusting.
But your evil mouth is much more disgusting.
I advise you to start talking
while you can.
Where's Aaron and Christ?
Useless.
You have nothing left
but to hide inside the walls
soaked in dirt and shit.
If you don't give up,
every captured scout will get a beating on the neck.
And it will all start with the most rotten of you,
Erwin Smith.
Shut up.
You still haven't answered the question.
The life of one scout is worth another.
Only fools who understand it
come to us.
Tell me, where's Aaron and Christ?
I don't know.
I'm not supposed to know.
Kenny Ackerman doesn't trust anyone.
Ackerman.
Kenny, I know.
Is that his last name?
Yeah, that's right.
He does know how to keep secrets,
especially if they're important.
But you know something for sure.
Put your memory on the line.
No!
You still have a lot of bones left.
You...
You're not normal!
Maybe.
Someone's coming from the other side!
He's not alone!
I told you, Captain.
It's useless.
The scouts will come to an end anyway.
You've got a good view.
Good for you.
You were teaching me lessons the other day.
You stand in front of the king.
They'll figure out how to deal with the scouts
and they'll give you a sentence.
Nile.
Where's your homeland?
Stochas, I think.
Maria...
Your family.
It's all right.
All the kids are fine.
And Maria doesn't complain.
I haven't been home for a while.
But he's in the eastern part of Rhodes.
I see.
What kind of weird questions are these?
I'll give some things to Pixis.
When the time comes...
I'll be just an observer.
You'll decide.
You and them.
I understand that we didn't get anything from Erwin.
Yeah.
Pastor Nick didn't reveal any secrets to him.
History of Paradise can say anything about itself,
but words are nothing.
How stupid.
In any case, they're just birds in a cage,
waiting for death.
Excuse me.
Erwin Smith,
I'm sorry.
Erwin Smith has arrived.
All right.
We're on our way, Nick.
As soon as we get rid of him,
the order will be restored,
and all the secrets of the walls will be safe.
We'll keep the world inside the walls.
Forever.
Erwin,
do you have anything to say?
