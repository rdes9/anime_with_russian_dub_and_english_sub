        <pre>That day humanity remembered
In the darkness, the shadows proceed without anyone's notice
The uncertain future always blooms on the surface
Every time the night comes
With cold hands, our necks became gentle
The fight betrays us, we cling to our hopes
Even if we know that we are heading to hell
If you want to see the continuation of your dreams
What will you start with?
The devil is an ancient translator
He creates a path with his tongue
What is there beyond this wall?
The truth that we longed for in our childhood
Is right there, just ahead of this dead end
Even if the wings fly away
Even if the wings fly away
Even if the wings fly away
Even if the wings fly away
Even if the wings fly away
Even if the wings fly away
Even if the wings fly away
Even if the wings fly away
We will keep on moving
To the other side of the world
Erwin, he's up
Siam, avoid the armored giant
Keep your distance
Yes, sir
Haji, why is there no signal for a fight?
What is he thinking about?
He's watching the enemy
Reiner and his friends have prepared a special warm welcome for us
The one who carries some kind of burden on his back on the fours
He has transformed not now
So he is their scout
If he noticed our approach and told Reiner
Then most likely
This four-legged smart giant
However, there may be others
The giant is carrying a load
What is there?
It's coming
A few two- and three-meter ones are approaching
Just like during the battle at the Uthgard castle
They will start with horses
Their main task is to capture Eren
And for that
They need to cut off our only way to retreat
They need to cut off our only way to retreat
And for that
They need to cut off our only way to retreat
Now there are a lot of giants on the territory of the wall of the sea
We can't get back without horses
Having killed the horses, they will deprive us of supply
And we have nowhere to run
It's just a matter of time
When we are weak, we will not be able to move
They will not have to risk the battle
All that remains is to come and take Eren
Their formation
The big giants remain in their positions
This proves that they are going to lock us up in their city
Commander!
Armored and close!
We didn't manage to find Bertolt!
Yes, I know
At the moment, the worst is yet to come
If Reiner and Bertolt kill all the horses without hindrance
What does that mean?
Are you going to command?
They will have time to have breakfast here
Dirk and Marlen units
Together with Klaus's unit, defend the horses
Levi's and Hanje's units
Armored on you
Use a copy of the thunder to your advantage
Do not spare the means to achieve the goal
This moment is a battle
The fate of humanity depends on them
In the name of humanity
Give your hearts
Yes!
Did you hear?
Focus on the giants coming to our horses
Yes!
Wait, Levi Armin
Your squad has left, but I need you here, Levi
Defend the horses and Hanje Armin?
Correct
And at the right time, attack him
Only you can handle the beast
It is clear
I failed to kill the armored
Compensating the head of the beast
Armin, I know how to deal with the armored
Okay
This battle can be divided into two parts
And one of them I want to lay on your shoulders with Hanje
Here they are
All in one place
I'll kill the horses and I'll give it to you right away
Here's the whole plan
No matter how strong Levi is
He still can't handle our commander
It was close
If I slowed down with the transfer of consciousness to the body
I would have died instantly
How did they even think of looking for us inside these walls?
Armin, your idea
Okay, it doesn't matter
Our long journey has finally come to an end
Armin Smith
You can't get distracted
First you have to kill the horses
Aaron?
Why did he decide to show up?
They know perfectly well that he is our main goal
What was he thinking?
Will he cross the southern wall and escape?
He can only get to the throne in the form of a giant
If we let that happen
We won't have a reason to continue fighting here
Even if we manage to destroy the intelligence corps
We can't let go of the one who held the claim for two months
We can't let him learn to fully control the coordinates
No, stop, that's weird
If he ran away
He would use the UPM to climb the wall before the transformation
Why transform into isolated shiganshins?
All clear
They want
For me to switch with the horses to Aaron
So you don't give me time to think
Oh, this commander
And I had to climb here
Great, he's got it
Make a bait out of Aaron?
Yes, that's Commander Erwin's order
I see
I had to use Aaron to protect the horses
What's the point?
What if Reiner still decides to attack the horses?
No, he will definitely go after Aaron
If Reiner chooses the horses
Aaron will be able to bypass the giants and attack the beast
Levi, who is subordinate to Aaron
Is quite capable of defeating the beast
Erwin said the same
Yes
If everything goes according to plan
Aaron will still be able to escape
That's enough to bring the enemy into confusion
It all depends on Reiner's calculations
I'm sure he'll do just that
All right, we'll take on the armored shiganshin
Wait
I have something else to worry about
Bertolt
He's still hiding
In the last battle
Aaron was one step away from defeating Reiner
But since Bertolt got him in trouble
And Aaron was captured
We need countermeasures
Lead the battle away from the walls
Maybe I was just lucky
But I've already defeated you
The victory will be mine
One on one, I can do it
In a hand-to-hand combat
Aaron was a much more formidable opponent
You know where we are right now
This is the place
Which I
Which we
Called home
I'll get my revenge
This is my home
I'll destroy you
And take everything
That you stole
A copy of the thunder
The weapon created for the battle with the armored giant
Damage from it is equal to the damage from lightning strike
Newbies
Take the horses to the west
Dirk's squad, cover them
Where to, Marl?
We were ordered not to leave them in one place
Not here, further
They're going east, over there
These are giants
Captain Levi
This is our chance, now
We need to deal with the small ones
Until the beast-like one attacks
No losses, don't you dare die
Yes
Damn it
I feel sorry for them
These weak mouths are too fast
It would be better if they stayed up
With four meters, we barely make it
And the first steps
The intelligence corps is not what it used to be
But
Without these victims
We wouldn't have been able to go so far
When I was a cadet
I told everyone about my father's theory
Which I believed in so much
I thought that if I became an agent
I could prove it
But when I joined the intelligence corps
I stopped talking about it for some reason
No, it's not like that
There was no reason
I just realized
That only
I fight only for myself
That only I have a dream
Which I want to realize
I didn't have time to remember
How I started to give orders
And to inspire my comrades
I asked to give my heart for humanity
So I fooled my comrades
I fooled myself
And now I'm on the mountain of their corpses
Standing here all alone
And yet
Thoughts about the basement don't come out of my head
Even if the plan fails
Before death I will get to it
To the basement left by Grisha Yeager
To the truth of our world
I trained hard
With these fists I can fight
Concentrated assertion makes them even stronger
His armor covers the whole body
For me, it's like a crust of ice
Too slow, moron!
Damn!
Damn!
Damn!
Damn!

Hann
We're too early for that!
Let's wait for Eron to give us a chance
Is this a stick and a new weapon?
It's better to call it a spear.
The engineering corps did a good job.
They used the technology that the Center Police revealed.
I ordered them a weapon that can be used against an armored giant.
Against an armored one?
Our blades are useless against his armor.
Until the bristles began to open in the armor,
we just had to watch Aaron fight an armored giant.
That's true. When he brought Aaron, we couldn't do anything at all.
At that time, if the commander didn't put a crowd of giants on him...
So far, only Aaron's grip in the form of a giant has been effective against an armored giant.
We also have high hopes for experiments with the assertion of fists.
However, we cannot rely only on Aaron's strength.
The goal of the Golden Wall is important, but the main goal is to get rid of Rainer and Bertold,
who can break through the new bristles.
So you want us to pierce the armor with these spears?
It will be easier to show. Let's go outside.
You saw his power. Compared to the lightning strike, we called them a copy of the thunder.
However, we can only check if they can take the armored one in practice.
They are effective against ordinary ones, but it will not be so easy to damage the armored one.
They are effective against ordinary ones, but it will not be so easy to damage the armored one.
You bastard!
It seems I'm not alone with Aran.
I'm not alone.
I have no choice.
Now!
They're coming?
I knew they were going to get me.
But I'm not scared of them.
Every inch of my body is covered with armor.
And they won't even scratch me.
Did it work?
No, not yet.
The thunder copy is so destructive,
that it's even dangerous for the shooter himself.
If you cling to the giant's neck,
as with a regular blade attack,
you yourself will be hit by an explosion.
The thunder copy can only be used
where there are enough elevations
for which it can be used.
But it can also be used
where there are enough elevations
for which you can cling.
In any other case,
you won't be able to use the thunder copy.
So everything will be solved
here and now!
It worked!
It worked!
The armor on the neck is pierced!
Oh, come on!
The copies worked!
One more time!
Attack the copies one more time!
Finish him off!
Rainer!
Guys!
We were ready for this!
Go!
Go!
Stop!
To be continued
To be continued
To be continued
To be continued
Could the words said that day
change the future?
And because of the responsibility for other people's lives,
they wish for each other's death.
Next, the fall.
