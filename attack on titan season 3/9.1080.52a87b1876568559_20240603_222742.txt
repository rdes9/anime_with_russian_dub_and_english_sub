The true king of the walls, Rod Reiss, could not fulfill his treacherous plan.
The scouts managed to save Eren and his story.
However, when they turned to the giant, Rod Reiss again became on their way.
I just wanted to trust my father.
I didn't want to disappoint him.
Well, now it's time for us to say goodbye.
The queen has the right to cut this short.
How are you going to evacuate civilians?
There will be no evacuation.
All the residents of Orwood will remain in this city.

Episode 9
The King of the Walls
What are you thinking about, Erwin?
Why are we not going to evacuate civilians?
By dawn, this giant will be right under our wall.
This giant is abnormal.
So what?
Our goal is not to evacuate civilians.
This is abnormal.
That's why he ignores the small villages and goes straight to the protected city.
If you start evacuating civilians right now, he will pass through it and destroy everything on his way.
As a result, the city will be destroyed.
As a result, he will go to Mitre, the most densely populated city,
and this will be a devastating blow to humanity.
On the way here, Eren Yeager tried to use the power that controlled the giants,
but Rod Reiss did not respond.
Stop, you giant!
Hey, stop!
I'm ordering you!
Do you hear me, you dumbass?
Rod Reiss, I'm telling you!
You damn old man!
If we want to stop him, we need to act outside the walls of Orwood.
And for that we will have to make a bait out of the citizens.
However, this does not cancel the fact that we are obliged to protect ordinary citizens.
If we do not stop the goal, we will take measures to save all the residents.
We will declare a training alarm in Orwood.
And if necessary, the citizens will be ready for this evacuation.
It seems that there is no choice.
We did not have such a goal before.
In fact, it will be easy to aim at him.
The wall cannons will be effective.
But if their power is not enough,
the reconnaissance corps will let all their forces in.
In these exercises, the cannons will be used.
And a bunch of giants.
A large-scale training.
They have not been carried out before.
However, do not panic.
Just follow our ...
Dear.
I need to prepare a bench for the opening.
Can you let me go?
You will not have customers today.
Have a day off.
I have a doubt.
Why is there training on the inner territory?
The military first overthrew the government, and now this?
What are you talking about?
I think they are showing their strength.
They want to prove that the power of the false king is now in their hands.
So they just arranged this mess here?
Yes.
If this goes, it would be better for the false king to continue to rule.
Hey, look!
Hey, look!
Smoke?
Fire!
Fire!
So, did it work?
Fire, fire!
Fire, fire!
Fire, fire!
Fire!
Earth weapons are even less efficient.
Of course.
The wall cannons hardly hit the back of the head.
What's the problem?
The soldiers are confused.
The cannons didn't hit.
The commanders are very weak.
Besides, this is the northern region.
Unlike the front-line troops,
they don't even have the experience of fighting.
However, even with such resources,
we have to cope.
Yes.
It can't be any other way.
And again, the whole strategy of the scouts
is coming together
into another adventure.
However, like all your plans.
Erwin!
I'm with the hotel!
All the ropes,
gunpowder and nets,
what are there?
All that's left is to collect.
Ah, and this.
On the other hand, there is the same.
We attached a launching mechanism,
so it will work
just like UPM.
Well, the cannons did the damage.
No more than a mosquito bite.
So we really use this?
Levi,
Jean, Sasha,
Connie, this side is yours.
Yes!
How would we tie them up better?
Imagine that this is a very valuable
gift for someone important.
Levi already told you
the story.
If we manage to survive,
we will make you the queen of the whole
of our state.
Understand,
you shouldn't be on the front line.
I don't think you can do it.
Will the naive people
accept the ruler
only because of his name?
Well, what do you suggest?
Fire!
Connie!
The story.
It became so strong.
All this time I thought it was weak.
But it wasn't.
I was weak.
At some point I started to consider myself
special.
When other soldiers died for me,
I took it for granted.
Also from the power of giants.
I hated giants.
But without any hesitation
I was able to become one of them.
I wanted to believe that
it was only my power.
That's exactly what the weak think.
Well, what's next?
If I manage to
build a wall,
will I be able to save humanity?
I am not a chosen one.
And yet,
the situation of humanity
is clearly not to be envied.
After all,
I am the one who
turned him into a goat.
You know,
the children in this city
remind me
of what we were like
that day.
Yeah.
They don't know that today
a giant will attack twice
higher than the wall itself.
They have no idea
what's going to happen.
They have no idea
what's going to happen.
They will have to experience
the same thing as we did then.
But still,
there is a difference.
On the walls of giants
there will be soldiers
and it will be us.
Come on, put it over there.
Eren,
it's not time to rest.
Get back to work.
Eren!
Wait!
What's wrong with you?
Do you want to turn yourself in?
It's too early.
No, I was just
beating Doris out of a tear.
I hope he will never
appear again.
Get ready!
Aim at the back of your head!
Fire!
Got it!
There's a breach.
Let's finish it off with the next blow.
Damn it!
That was bad.
The wind changed direction.
Captain, I don't see anything!
It doesn't matter.
The target is under us.
Fire!
We didn't make it.
It's a giant!
It's a giant!
Stop! Don't run!
Shut up!
Back off!
Back off!
Damn it!
It's going to break.
My hometown
is going to end.
Back off, Captain.
We're going to do it ourselves.
Aaron, our way out.
Yeah.
Armin,
everything's going to be different now.
Huh?
Maybe that's not what everyone was hoping for.
But now,
humanity has a goat.
Another giant!
We're ready!
Start!
Attack!
Take this!
There it is.
It's falling.
Aaron!
Aaron,
we got it.
We got it.
Get down.
Get down.
I'm going to do my best.
You're going to survive.
I'm going to do my best.
I'm going to win.
I'm going to do my best.
Yeah, you've got this.
I'll get you to the end of the world.
I'm going to get you to the end of the world.
Yeah, I'm going to win.
The explosion outside will not bring the right effect.
That is why the gunpowder must be inside.
Perhaps he crawls on the ground only to cover his face.
That is, his mouth is not closed at all.
We will bet on this.
We are lucky!
To be continued...
To all troops, use the UPM!
He may be huge, but his weak spot is the same as everyone else's.
If we do not destroy the core, it will regenerate and start to emit heat again.
We will have one attempt.
Hot!
Damn! What a... history!
I understand your motives, but I can not let you into the fight.
Commander, please.
I finally understood what my purpose is.
That's why I'm here.
Well, in that case, in my current condition, I still can not stop you, right?
I'm sorry, my selfishness.
But I went against my parents for the first time.
This is my first fight with my father.
Father!
Listen, father!
We can get rid of the giants!
Why?
How do you not understand?
I can handle it, brother.
Believe me.
Alma, only you understand me.
Put it on me, father.
I will not lose to the ghosts of our ancestors.
Lord!
Our city is saved.
Hey, are you alive?
Are you not wounded?
Did you finish it?
Yes, I finished it.
Well, let's go.
Come on, let's go.
Come on, let's go.
Come on, let's go.
Come on, let's go.
Come on, let's go.
Come on, let's go.
Come on, let's go.
So did you finish that giant?
It didn't surprise me.
I really acted at my own will.
I don't know anymore.
But if someone is swimming here,
then it's definitely me.
My name is...
My name is Rise.
I am the true ruler of the walls.
I can't die yet.
Please, forgive me.
As much as you can.
I'm talking to you.
What's your name?
That's why we are ready for any order.
Are you the same?
It doesn't matter to me.
It all makes no sense.
Captain Ackerman!
Stupid, run!
Captain Ackerman!
Kenny.
God, it's you.
All your comrades have died in that cave.
You are the only survivor.
It looks like it.
Report.
I'm here myself.
I've taken the order.
The burns and blood loss...
It won't take long for you to recover.
I see.
I can't believe it.
Captain Ackerman!
Captain Ackerman!
Captain Ackerman!
Captain Ackerman!
Captain Ackerman!
I can't believe it.

THE END
Levi found Kenny on the verge of death.
He dug up the memories of the man who became his friend
in his dying mind.
Next.
Friends.
