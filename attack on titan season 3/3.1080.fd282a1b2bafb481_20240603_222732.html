        <pre>The angel is washed away by the wind of time and falls into the starry night
The angel is washed away by the wind of time and falls into the starry night
As far as I remember, I've always helped with the household.
My mother would read all the time. I've never seen her working.
She was a beautiful woman.
At night, a carriage would come for her.
I, dressed in clothes, went to the city.
I didn't know any other life before.
When I started reading and writing, I got carried away with reading, imitating my mother.
And then I realized how lonely I was.
In those books, parents cared about their children.
In all stories, they constantly talked, hugged or quarreled.
And there was never anything like that between us.
One day, out of curiosity, I decided to try hugging my mother.
I was curious how she would react.
Mom!
As a result, I was just shocked.
But it was the first time she paid attention to me.
And I was happy about that.
But why didn't I have the courage to kill her before?
The first words I heard from her.
After that, she left home and started living somewhere else.
And then, five years ago, at night, right after Maria's fall from the wall,
I saw my father for the first time.
Nice to meet you, Historia.
My name is Rod Reiss. I am your father.
This man, he was the ruler of the land we lived in.
I haven't seen my mother for years, but she looked scared.
Historia, from now on you will live with me.
This is a problem, Lord Reiss.
Maybe you shouldn't be in such a hurry.
Or did Maria's fall scare you so much?
Mom!
No.
The girl is crazy, I'm not her mother.
I have nothing to do with her at all.
Oh, is that true, Lord Reiss?
You are not her mother.
Let it be so.
These women have nothing to do with me.
That's what I thought.
What? What are you?
You've never been.
You've never worked for Maria.
You're not her mother.
You're not her mother.
You're not her mother.
You're not her mother.
You're not her mother.
You're not her mother.
You've never worked for Maria.
No one ever knew you.
That's not true, Lord Reiss.
Tell them that's not true.
Mom...
It's better if...
It's better if you weren't there.
Those were the last words of my mother.
Wait.
But when the knife was already in my throat,
my father suggested another way out.
If I send them to live in the gorge
and I don't declare myself,
they won't kill me.
From now on, your name is Crystal Lens.
I'm sorry for everything.
I didn't have a choice.
That's the only way I could protect you.
Father...
I've been thinking about you all the time.
I've been dreaming about the day
when I could hug you.
You're special.
You're special.
You're special.
You're special.
You're special.
Take yourself away.
You're special.
You have Royal blood in your veins.
So, I am...
That's true, Leia.
Actually, the throne belongs
to the Reiss family.
You're special.
And вот только жить,
да всё и questioning that's all.
Okay, Leia.
Let's go.
Sanas, how are you? Are you alive?
Hey, you didn't tell them anything, did you?
Our loyalty to the king is more important.
Sanas!
Don't open your evil mouth anymore!
You betrayed us almost right away!
I trusted you!
I trusted you!
Sanas, he didn't tell us anything.
We didn't even interrogate him.
We put a knife in Ralph's throat and forced him to read what I wrote.
That's all.
So, it was me who betrayed his majesty.
You're demons.
I'm not going to deny it.
Nick thought the same thing about you.
Do you remember what I said?
I really sympathize with you.
What a pitiful sight.
The grown-up men let out their snot.
And it's your business, you morons!
You're going to shit the rest of your pitiful life in this stone cow!
Goodbye.
There is an order...
...by which we...
There is an order...
...by which we play our part.
One ends, and the next always comes in his place.
And nothing in the world will change that.
Good luck, Hanje.
Commander.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I made a lot of noise.
There was a cockroach here.
I see.
Well, I think after such a blow, it was torn apart.
Let's go. It's time to tell everyone.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Are they going to eat us?
Yeah.
In the conversation that Aaron remembered, there was the following.
Are you mad at me?
In fact, I don't even know.
I don't think you wanted to eat a man.
Based on this, it can be assumed that the world was a giant living behind the wall.
And it ate comrade Bertel, Reiner and Annie.
By eating a man, the giant does not return to human form.
However, if you eat someone like Reiner, those like them have the power to turn into giants.
It turns out that if the giant eats someone with such power, he can become a human again.
Moreover, he himself will get the power to turn.
In our last battle, Reiner threw the giants running out of Aaron.
Aaron is able to control the giants with a scream, and the giants could steal this power.
In this case, Aaron is just a shell that can be replaced.
In fact, if the government has its own giant, they will feed him Aaron.
Calm down. No matter how angry you are, Aaron will not just give it to us.
In any case, we will visit this kind of paradise.
Be ready to leave.
Yes!
I will report to Erwin that we have found out about the paradise.
He was already waiting for the report.
Right.
Let's meet at the place of the paradise. Contact me.
Excuse me. Commander Erwin, Pixis has come to you.
Commander?
Yes. He wants to see you.
Let him in.
Yes.
Sorry for the late visit.
But I couldn't wait until morning.
I read your letter.
But let me ask you. Are you serious?
Yes.
For the sake of restoring the wall of Mary, we will overthrow the government.
I knew it would happen one day.
This tight world will hold people back only until they are calm.
And when the time comes, I will have to point the gun at the king.
If my calculations are correct, the use of force will not be required to carry out this plan.
And all deaths can be avoided.
Oh, then I have all the attention. Does this method really exist?
However, the preparatory work is not completed yet.
If something goes wrong, me and my people will definitely have fun.
Oh, and everything. In other words, another adventure.
It's time to make bets.
The news will come very soon.
And until they are gone, I would like to tell the story of my childhood.
My father. He was a teacher.
Sounded on the project manilibria.tv. Thank you for choosing us.
What is it?
Commander, this is ...
Yes, I see it myself.
Excuse me, Erwin.
As I thought.
And still, I did not guess my bet.
The officer of the first squad split.
The current king is a fake.
The real king is Reiss.
Really?
Now Levi's squad is engaged in saving the air and history.
When they are returned, we will announce the history of Reiss, the heiress of the throne,
because the queen's blood flows in her veins.
And in your opinion, the fake king will simply give up the crown?
The real queen.
We will overthrow the government without getting our hands in the blood.
And the people will know that the system in which they lived was a fake.
Okay.
I like your plan.
However, it is not up to us to decide whether it will be carried out or not.
Do you understand this, Erwin?
Of course, commander.
Well, did you find out anything about Reiss?
I dug up everything I could.
And there was something interesting among them.
Interesting?
Commander Erwin, the military police demand surrender.
They claim that the murder on the square is your business.
It seems that the enemy also has its own plans.
Hanji, get out of here.
What did you think?
I will act as a person of the intelligence legion.
And you act on your own.
And Hanji Zoya will be the commander of the intelligence.
Congratulations.
The intelligence officers are in your hands.
Hey, that's him.
That's Erwin.
I think you know who Erwin is.
The head of the Reiss company.
Mr. Dima Reiss.
Yesterday, right at this place, the Reiss people kidnapped Erno Jäger.
However, the intelligence officers did not want to give Erno Jäger to the government.
Therefore, they decided to negotiate with the Reiss company about the kidnapping.
And then, when Reiss played his part, they simply got rid of the tongue.
The murderer is free and is now hiding with Erno.
What a convenient story.
And don't be ashamed, scoundrels.
This is an attempt to fully master the power of Erno.
This action violates the sixth act of the human race.
You know what it is.
The action in accordance with your will, in the damage to human security.
That's right.
As a result of this, in accordance with the violation of the specified law, all intelligence officers must be detained.
Father.
Well, now our fat sum will be satisfied.
Riefs would be satisfied with the fact that he turned out to be useful.
You haven't figured it out with Levi yet?
I'm telling you, he'll come to us himself.
All his time.
What are we going to do now?
Can I have a minute?
Get away from my husband, you bastard!
During the battle for Throst, Mr. Riefs was detained in evacuation, trying to steal his wealth.
What's wrong with that?
Do you think he deserved to die?
However, even knowing in what tragic situation Throst is in now, he decided to stay here and do everything he could to help the destitute and revive the city.
And yet, someone destroyed this dream with his own hands.
And so, he decided to stay here.
My father.
He was a teacher.
Once, in history class, in order to help the destitute and revive the city, someone destroyed this dream with his own hands.
I promise.
I'll avenge him.
My father.
He was a teacher.
Once, in history class, in order to protect himself from the giants, humanity hid in the walls and lived in peace.
At the same time, all the records about our past were lost.
This is what everyone teaches us.
But one day, I doubted this and asked my father a question.
My father turned away from the answer and finished the class as usual.
However, when we returned home, my father answered my question.
He said that the state textbook had not yet been completed.
My father told me a lot.
I was surprised, even though I was just a child.
There was a reason why he did not tell all this in class.
But then I did not understand it.
I told his story to other children.
And then the military came to me with an interrogation.
They said that I was a child.
My father did not come back that day.
He died in some unfortunate accident.
But I guessed that my father was killed by the government.
107 years ago, humanity hid inside the walls, and the king changed their memory so that it would be easier to rule.
This is the theory.
That is, if he had not done this, the state would not have succeeded inside the walls.
Yes.
Since childhood, I have been thinking about why my father should have died only because he had come closer to the truth.
It seemed to me that even officials have a sense of justice.
However, now I understand their motive.
They are trying to protect not humanity, but their homes, land and wealth.
It turns out that if someone threatens them with power, they will get rid of him no matter what.
There is no justice.
I do not understand.
The stupidity of my own son and human greed ruined him.
I did not have time to look at how the theory of my father became the truth in my heart.
From now on, the goal of my life is to prove the theory of my father once and for all.
The legion of reconnaissance killed the citizens.
Some were not caught, they are still free.
If you see any of them, immediately inform the police.
But I told you.
They set up a meat grinder with giants here and destroyed the whole city.
Yes, they definitely use it for the genocide.
Captain, we bought the supplies.
The military police gave it away.
If this is true, the legion of reconnaissance will be disbanded.
They say we were attacked.
There are garrisons almost on all roads.
And it is impossible to pass without a pass.
Captain, what should we do?
We need to save Aaron.
Calm down.
They are moving by car.
There is at least one day of travel to the territory of Raissa.
We will spend this time developing the plan.
Captain, I hear a step.
They are coming from that side.
The continuation follows.
The project Manilibria.TV was announced in 2018.
Sharon, Amikiri and Ados.
Blase sound timing was announced for free.
Home viewing.
The end.
Those who risk their lives, those who believe in justice,
those who defend the city,
courage fed by memories,
give the will to fight.
Next, trust.
