So, now we'll be able to make a hole in Maria's wall.
The Intelligence Legion is in a hurry to get back to Maria's wall.
Great! We did it, Eren!
Eren!
Eren!
We need to make weapons and go to Shiganshin.
It seems if I do it, I'll become a giant myself.
Another factor has appeared.
Another thing that can change their fate.
I'm sorry for being late.
So, we managed to find out what's in the container.
Unfortunately, our technology didn't allow us to conduct an accurate analysis.
Eren and Historia told us that this substance was made on the basis of human body fluid.
But due to the fact that it evaporates in contact with the air, the analysis is impossible.
Its creator used more advanced technologies than ours.
If Reiss did it, I can't even imagine how.
Then it's better not to disassemble it and use it in the next operation.
But who should I trust?
Eren, maybe you?
No.
Right now, I'm just an ordinary cripple.
And this case should be stored with the best soldier with the greatest chance of survival.
Levi, will you take it?
If necessary, give the order.
What are these questions for?
You can't predict what situation it will be useful in.
You will be responsible for making decisions on the fly.
You will be the one to choose who and when to give it to.
Are you ready for that?
If your dream comes true, what will you do next?
I have no idea.
It's too early to think about it.
I see.
Good.
I'll take it.
By the way, I want to present my work to the people.
What do you say?
You haven't left this idea yet.
If people see this disgusting sight, trust the military and fall below the plinthus.
You don't mean anything in art.

The Night of Battles for the Wall
That is, Father Eren, Grisha Jäger, most likely also came to us from behind the walls.
Yes, exactly the same as Enya and Reiner with Bertold. He possessed the power of giants.
But unlike that trio, he was on the side of people living inside the walls.
Since he was so interested in the scouts, he could have helped us more.
I doubt it. As soon as he got behind the walls, he immediately started looking for the royal family alone.
Only a person with other decisiveness is capable of such a thing.
And this father wanted a ten-year-old son who wanted to become a scout to see them in the basement of the house.
And before he died, he said that all the truth was stored in the basement.
Really? What do you think is down there?
Something that cannot be said.
No. Grisha Jäger could not reveal it with all his will.
King Reiss erased all these memories, memories of our world.
That's what I hope. But now it's pointless to think about it.
The meeting is over for today. In two days we will go to the Wall of Mary.
If you want to know what's in the basement, then we'll see for ourselves. Isn't that the essence of scouts?
Tell everything to the subordinates.
Yes, but not in detail. On such a day, you can eat meat.
Great idea. At least we'll get a little bit of make-up before the scouts.
And how do we deal with Commander Shades?
Forget about him. We don't have time for that.
That's right, Hange. He used to admire him.
Shut up.
What is it, Levi?
Don't rush things.
What about after the Wall of Mary is returned?
Of course, we'll strengthen our position first, but what about later?
We'll eliminate the threat.
Out there, someone is hoping that all of us will go to feed the giants.
I believe there is information in the basement about who exactly wants this.
As I said, we need to get into this basement first.
I'm just not sure you'll make it to this point.
You're not as stubborn as you used to be.
Let Hange lead us.
You'll just be a scoundrel.
Just wait here.
We'll tell the others that I made you do it.
No, I'll do it.
Do you agree?
No.
I'm ready to go to feed.
Use me.
I'm still your commander.
After me, they'll have Hange.
After her, someone else.
This operation will really be dangerous.
But there's nothing more important than her success for humanity.
I've gone too far.
I was the one who came up with the plan.
And without me, you have almost no chance of success.
That's right.
The operation may fail.
But if you give up, we're doomed.
So keep sitting and working your head off.
It's the worst option for the giants.
It's the worst option for the giants.
And for humanity, it's the best option.
It's not like that.
It's best to risk everything for...
Wait, wait, wait.
Calm down.
If you keep reading the lines, I'll break your legs.
These breaks will grow.
But while we're on the operation, you'll stay here crying.
You won't even be able to crawl to the toilet.
I don't want that.
Yes, you're absolutely right.
The wounded soldier has no place on the battlefield.
However,
when we find out the truth about this world,
I must be by your side.
And it's so important to you.
Is leg health more important?
Yes.
Is the victory of humanity more important?
Yes.
I see.
Erwin,
I trust your choice.
Today we have a special night, but it's better not to know about it.
Be patient and don't make a noise.
Meat?
Is it really meat?
I'm thirsty.
Let's drink to the return of the wall of Mary.
Hooray!
Hooray!
Hey, be quiet!
Hooray!
Hooray!
Hooray!
Hooray!
Hey, be quiet!
Calm down.
Let's split it equally.
Hey, this piece counts for two.
What else?
You can't even hold a blade.
You're not supposed to have meat.
What did you say?
Are you after your potato again?
It has already flown away from the coil.
Stop it, Sasha.
I don't want to kill you.
Haven't you been taught to share yet?
She will eat me now.
Sasha!
John, it's not a piece of meat!
Are you out of your mind?
The scouts don't even feed on meat.
I feel sorry for you.
Connie, she's going to die.
I'm trying!
She's in a deadlock, but she's still twitching.
It seems that there was no victim.
Well, who offered to kidnap me?
I'm sorry.
What do you know that a two-week supply of food will lead to such a thing?
Well, that's it.
Finally, I got out of it.
It's a nightmare.
And once she wanted to share meat with everyone.
When was that?
Four months ago.
We were working with cannons then.
I'm here from the officer's warehouse.
Don't worry.
That's how we'll get our land back.
We'll breed a bunch of cows and sheep.
Again?
What do you mean?
The giants are attacking!
Disappeared!
I was sorry for you.
Hey!
Since then, only four months have passed.
Yeah, only four.
But you know, we've already managed to get into the Levi squad.
It's not bad to get up like that.
Well, you're a genius.
Exactly!
Let's eat while it's still warm.
Yeah, get it.
Newbies without experience are the place to be accompanied.
Maybe I'm weak.
But isn't it easier to study the enemy in the vanguard?
What?
Do you think self-sacrifice is cool?
But if we don't think so, there's no way we can talk about efficiency.
Listen, we all started once.
If we put all the recruits on the front line, we won't have anyone to teach us.
That's why your task is simple.
But we do have a maniac with a tendency to commit suicide during the operation, don't we?
Jean, what are you hinting at?
You don't know.
A maniac, a suicide bomber.
Actually, I just found out something.
It turns out it's normal.
It's normal.
It's normal.
It's normal.
I just found out something.
It turns out it's normal.
And since you deny it, you have a sad soul.
Jean!
Have you lost your mind?
What the hell are you talking about?
Hey, what are you doing there?
Just don't hit me in the face.
What the hell are you doing?
What are they doing?
Bastard!
Show him!
He's barely standing on his feet.
They tricked him again.
He asked to behave decently.
I'm serious.
If you had the power of giants, you would have thrown your hoofs a long time ago.
How many times has Mikas saved your ass?
Well, if you want to die like that, I'll kill you myself.
I'll remember this.
It's worth paying tribute to your mommy, little Jean.
Forget it already.
We're not going to take it apart?
No.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Let him go.
Why isn't anyone stopping us?
How many times is it possible already?
Two times.
Now the whole place will go outside.
Hey.
Too much noise.
Everyone, leave.
And get out of here.
Yes, sir!
It's strange to hear that from me.
But shouldn't you be watching me?
I knew you were going to recover quickly, so I didn't interfere.
You're cruel and alive.
You started it yourself.
But you've become yourself again.
We didn't go to the designer in vain.
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter whether I became the same or not.
I need to fulfill my duty.
But yes, it became easier for me.
I was worried about all sorts of trifles.
I didn't understand why I couldn't become as strong as Mikas and Levi.
I was jealous.
I was afraid that they would kill me.
I was jealous.
But even those like you can't do much on your own.
And so everyone has to find their own destiny.
And only by uniting, we can gain strength.
All people are different.
But that's what their strength is.
Yes.
I think you're right.
When we brought Maria back to the Wall,
and won over all our enemies,
We will meet each other there again.
Look.
Look at her.
Look.
And we will defeat all our enemies.
Will we be able to
bring them back?
Of course.
But there is one thing that cannot be brought back.
And they will pay for it.
Yes.
But that's not all.
The sea.
There is so much salt in this huge lake
that not a single merchant will be able to pump it all out.
Behind these walls there are not only giants.
Ice lands, sandy plains,
fiery water.
I went into the intelligence to see all this.
Oh, yeah.
That's true.
The sea.
It's decided.
First we'll get to the sea.
You still don't believe me, do you?
You'll see, it exists.
All right, I'll see for sure.
I'll remember.
You promised.
We'll be able to explore the outer world.
It's much bigger on the outside than inside the walls.
I got it.
Chapter 3
We're close to sunset.
The time has come.
Hey!
Hange!
Good luck.
The future of humanity is in your hands!
Captain Levy!
Thank you for saving our city!
Come back alive!
Come back!
And our lands!
Don't forget to bring them back!
How did you talk it all out?
Well, we made a lot of noise last night.
The thing is, we ordered the meat in the company of R.I.F.S.
Damn Fliegel!
Yes! We have a winner!
And when was the last time we had such wires?
I don't even know. It didn't seem to be like that.
As far as I know, this is the first time.
Operation to return to the Wall of the Sea!
Let's get started!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
