Chapter seven
i felt that it was going to end
Everything I could trust in you.
Armin, why don't you run away?
Gigant?
Shit!
Try to find him!
It's better if he dies than get hit in the head!
What?
Is it marked?
Is he really a gigant too?
Is this beast similar?
Aren't you...
Eren Yeager?
Bad!
We need to kill Berthold!
You don't look like your father.
Shit!
Eren, I beg you.
I understand what you went through.
We both suffered from his hands.
Your father washed your brains.
Father?
What?
It can't be!
He got here after all.
Okay, Levi.
I have to admit a draw.
Berthold.
I'm sorry, but you're doomed.
Eren, I'll come back and save you.
He's running away.
Captain!
I ran out of gas. I'll go get him.
Give me your gas and blade!
Yes, sir!
Hurry!
Episode 6. White Night
Reiner.
What kind of metal case was in your left pocket?
You were trying to pull it out.
We didn't cut your arms and legs.
What was it?
Poison?
Or a bomb?
I'm sorry.
A letter.
A letter?
What kind of letter?
A letter.
Oh, Atemir.
She asked me to give it to Christie.
We'll read it ourselves first.
Well, I have a whole bunch of questions.
But it looks like you decided to keep your mouth shut.
Eren.
Are you going to answer our questions, Reiner?
No.
Thank you.
Now I can have some fun.
Wait!
Maybe we could take over his power?
Today's instruction will be dedicated to the use of ampoules.
Thanks to one injection, a person will be able to get the power of a giant,
armored, colossal, or animal-like.
After the injection, the person will need to eat the power of a giant.
That's the only way to get the power of a giant.
That's the only way to get the power of a giant.
That's the only way to get the power of a giant.
That's the only way to get the power of a giant and all his knowledge.
And that will also allow you to bring back the life of the dead.
If you catch the giant, cut off his limbs,
clean up the territory, and call Captain Levi.
This is our only ampoule.
I trust Captain Levi to take care of it.
I'm afraid we're not in the right place.
We don't know how Levi is doing.
There's no time or opportunity to explore the situation.
Our enemies are very cunning.
They might have a new
shell in their sleeve.
Even if you break his head, you can't relax.
It doesn't look like you, Hanje.
How can we beat the giants if we don't even try to find out about them?
Jean.
How much time will it take to understand the enemy?
Mikasa.
Yes?
How much gas do you have left?
Almost all of it is gone.
But it's enough to get to Armin and Eren.
More than I have.
Mikasa, go there and explore the situation.
Then refuel the gas and ask Levi for the syringe.
If for some reason you can't get it,
release the signal rocket.
And then we'll kill Reiner.
Understood.
Hanje, I...
It's my decision.
Your words helped me.
Why?
I...
I doubt such things.
Give it to me!
He's breathing!
Armin is still breathing!
Hold on!
I beg you!
Hold on!
Armin...
Captain!
Give me the syringe!
We'll turn Armin into a giant and feed him with shit!
Give me the syringe!
Okay.
Hanje!
No!
They took Reiner!
Hanje!
Bastard!
Coney!
Come back!
We have little gas left.
So we'll feed them.
Shit!
It's my fault.
I...
I made a fatal mistake.
I told you it was my decision.
I need to meet with Saren.
Captain...
Levi!
I found you!
I found you!
I found you!
Coney!
Myç¢ºin was lost!
It's more that just knowerletadgev.
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me even if I didn't kill him?
You're dead!
But you'd run for your life!
Commander Armin's dead!
It hit him in the stomach.
His organs have been badly damaged!
Blood flows from his face!
I think, we can make him one more pill,
What do you say?
Captain!
He's still breathing.
He's...
alive.
I'm going to do the Erwin-O-Qual.
You said you were going to give her to the army!
I choose the one who will save humanity.
Reiner, you're very lucky.
Guys, do you even understand what you're doing?
Do you want the legion's commander to die just like that?
Waste of time.
Stay out of it.
Eren, let go of your feelings.
Give up your feelings?
Then why didn't you give me the syringe right away?
I believed that Erwin could still be alive.
Locke brought Erwin here at the last minute.
You couldn't have expected this!
You're right.
Well, here's Erwin here and his injection.
No!
He's weaker than usual.
I'll take the syringe by force.
You have to understand, too.
Humanity has no chance against giants without Erwin.
He's right, Megas. Please stop this madness.
The army needs humanity, too.
Eren!
Isn't that obvious?
Thanks to the army, we were able to close the gate in Trost.
We understood who Eren was.
We began to move around the territory of the giants at night.
We found Reiner's shelter.
And Reiner!
We even managed to defeat Bertel!
And all this is thanks to the army!
Neither I nor the commander can save humanity!
The army can!
I'm right, Megas!
Give me the syringe, please!
Humanity will only save Commander Eren.
Shut your mouth!
But no.
It's not just hard for you!
You'll be surprised.
But there's not a single survivor left behind the wall.
They were all killed by the beast.
I thought we were all going to die in that hell.
Only Commander, only Erwin, thought otherwise.
He managed to come up with a plan to defeat the beast.
He worked!
He tore everyone to pieces, just like he planned!
He was ready to swear at them all.
It was scary.
When I found a living commander, I wanted to finish him off.
But...
I thought it was too easy.
He didn't suffer enough yet.
Then I realized...
Only the demon can defeat the giants!
And my purpose was to bring the demon back to life!
I believe I survived that bloody battle just for that!
So don't mess with me!
Enough!
Hange!
What?
It can't be!
No.
No.
I don't believe it.
Mikasa!
Erwin is our hope for salvation!
We can't let thousands of people die for this wall!
The same can be said about Armin!
You're right.
Armin is very capable.
But we need experience of Erwin's intuition!
And I have those I would give back.
Hundreds.
All those I served in the intelligence corps.
Hange!
Hange!
Well...
Don't you understand?
Everyone you love will die someday.
It's hard.
I still haven't calmed down.
I need to pull myself together so I don't go crazy.
It hurts.
It hurts a lot.
I understand.
But...
I have to move on.
Captain!
Do you know what the sea looks like?
It's a lake that stretches to the very horizon.
Armin!
Hey!
Stop it!
He's gone!
He's gone!
He's gone!
He's gone!
Stop it already!
He wanted to see the sea someday.
Can you imagine?
I completely forgot about our childhood dream.
I wanted to avenge my mother and kill all the giants.
I lived thanks to this hatred.
But he wasn't like that.
Armin didn't want to fight.
He dreamed of something else.
Get out of here!
I'm going to feed Bertolt Erwin.
Come on.
Let's go, Mikasa.
Damn.
Damn.
Armin.
Goodbye.
It's decided.
We'll get to the sea first.
You'll see.
It exists.
If your dream comes true, what will you do next?
No idea.
It's too early to think about it.
No.
At least I have a dream.
I have a dream.
I have a dream.
No.
I want to go down to the basement.
It's unbelievable.
They barely calmed down.
They were like small children.
Everyone in this life needs something to cling to.
Everyone has their own anchor.
But that's not all.
The sea!
The sea!
Erwin.
Teacher.
Why are you so sure there's no one behind the wall?
That's my dream.
The other one.
That's my dream.
Why are you so sure there's no one behind the wall?
Everyone has a dream.
I have a dream.
What?
Everyone has a dream.
Everyone has a dream.
I have a dream.
Everyone has their own dream.
I know.
Thanks.
Guys, help me!
They're the Ryder!
Captain, why him?
Can you forgive him?
It's not his fault he became a demon.
That's what we did to him.
He finally got a chance to free himself.
And we wanted to get him back.
It's time for him to go to rest.
Erwin, I swore to kill the Ryder.
But I still have to wait.
He's already dead.
I see.
To be continued...
To be continued...
To be continued...
To be continued...
The news of Bertolt and Erwin's death shocked Armin.
However, Erwin almost got to the basement of his father.
Next, the basement.
