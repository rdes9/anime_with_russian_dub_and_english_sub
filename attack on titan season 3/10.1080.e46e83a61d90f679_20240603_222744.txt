All right, we're ready.
Great! Put it down!
Captain Levi!
What's up?
It's like you saw a ghost.
We found Kenny Ackerman!
And again the titans!
I'm sorry.
That's the truth.
Why did you leave?
Episode 10
Friends
I never thought that one day I would find
someone stronger than me.
So this is the giant.
So they exist.
And even inside the walls.
Uri!
Can you let him go?
Wait, don't shoot.
I don't know who told him about us.
But it's definitely someone from the council.
We need to find the accused.
But then use your strength
and make him talk!
It doesn't work.
If that's the case,
then he's one of the descendants
of the Ackerman family.
Then he has
decent reasons
to point a blade at me.
Uri!
If you don't kill him,
I'll do it!
Oh, come on!
I'm really sorry!
It's you, our true king!
Put your hands away!
Let me go!
Let me go!
Give me another chance!
I couldn't do anything
against such great power.
At that moment,
he didn't have to
crush me.
I could only speak
the language of violence
and that's when he brought me up.
Now I understand
that I never had
to hate my family.
Idiot!
He can't hold his legs!
Hey, Uri!
What are you doing?
He's an Ackerman!
You can't erase his memory!
We need to kill him!
Considering
what kind of torture
the Ackermans suffered
because of our family,
your anger is fair.
But still,
I'm afraid I can't die
right now.
Please, forgive me.
Even on such tiny lands
it's impossible
to recreate paradise.
I was wrong.
And this king
with incredible power
bowed to destruction
like me.
I was impressed
by the power of the giant
but after his exit
something broke in me.
I offered him
my help
and Uri nodded.
I gave him my advice
and the man who gave me Reiss
disappeared without a trace.
And I took his place
being the Ackerman's dog.
That's how I got my job.
It sounds a little pathetic
but that's how the chase
of the Ackermans stopped.
Although I didn't risk
walking in broad daylight.
But I had fewer enemies.
Kushel?
Oh, you mean Olympia?
She's sick
and no one's been shooting
Eternity.
Oh,
what a horror.
You've lost weight,
Kushel.
Yes.
And you?
Are you still alive?
Oh, oh,
I only dream about the dead.
I'm talking to you.
What's your name?
Levi.
Just Levi.
That's how it is,
Kushel.
It's true
that
it's better not to know
that name.
I'm Kenny.
Just Kenny.
I knew well,
Kushel.
We'll be friends.
The grumpy boy
on the verge of death.
All that left Kushel
after himself.
I couldn't just leave
and let Krotyshka die.
But I wasn't going to
replace his father.
I didn't have much to teach
and he had nothing.
But first I showed
how to hold a knife,
how to lay with others.
And how to greet them,
how to negotiate
and how to wave with a knife.
It was going to be
enough to survive
in the underground.
If he wanted,
he could get to the surface.
But
only if
he would do it himself.
Let's pray.
Let's pray
in the name of true harmony.
The police, the Center.
Ah,
so that's who you are.
I'm sorry
that so many of yours came.
But now everything is different.
The King was able to extinguish your ashes.
His greatness
is limitless.
You know,
Sanas,
you're not even
a little bit of a king.
That's why I do
any task.
Aren't you the same?
Why are you loyal to the King?
I...
Who knows?
Probably
because of his power.
Yes.
In our world
there is a ruler
who gives his power to others.
Power
decides everything.
At least
that way you're not
in danger of my sister's fate.
I don't have long
left.
It's obvious
from one side.
Monsters,
powerless against old age.
I'm disappointed.
It's not about that.
This power
is inherited by the children of the family.
But I will continue
to live in their memories.
What are you talking about?
Can you pass this power?
I don't have long
left until the end of this world.
I dream of recreating
the rest of humanity.
Do you believe
in the power of violence?
It's an integral part
of this world.
And yet
what is the cause
of the birth of our friendship?
Violence?
I don't know.
But if you
didn't catch me
that time
I would have
shot you in the head.
And then
there would be no friendship.
Yes.
You can't argue with that.
But even so
I still believe
that it was a miracle.
Since that day
I have never
crossed paths with him again.
As he said
the power of violence
has gone to the child.
One look in her eyes
was enough.
The daughter of the family
also spoke to her followers.
She preached peace and love
just like he did before.
Why do you need to do
all this nonsense?
Simply because
the power allows it.
And if someone else
gets this power
it's the same.
Even
the same as me.
I'm Kenny Ackerman.
The same Kenny's wife
if you're interested.
In the past
I've been bored of cutting the throats
of elite policemen like you.
Well, it has come to be
that now I will lead
your new anti-missile squad.
Glad to meet you.
Hmm, well
you're probably
confused.
I'm sure you're not
excited about
that your boss
has become a sleeping maniac.
I don't care.
Two years have passed
and people have stopped
fighting giants,
starting to fight each other
for the remaining land.
Isn't that why we're here?
We followed the rules.
We climbed the career stairs
and got here.
I don't care.
There's no point in that.
Don't be afraid.
There will be no
confrontation with the intelligence.
It's just a cover.
Just a catch for
the devoured politicians from the council.
So why are you here?
I'll tell you why.
It's all for the sake of the dream.
Divine power.
Anyone who possesses it
will know mercy.
And even such a scoundrel
like me
I want to know
what it is.
What kind of
a world is it for them?
How do they see it?
Will Atreus
be able to see
this world in the same light
as you?
What do you think, Uri?
Kenny.
It was voiced by
manilibria.tv
Fires and blood loss.
You have little time left.
Is that so?
Really?
I took it
right out of the family bag.
It seems if I stab it
I'll become a giant myself.
I'm a brainless giant.
Unfortunately.
But at least
it'll let me
survive.
You had enough time
to make a spell.
Why didn't you use it?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
No one has ever used it.
I see.
If I don't do it right
I can end it
just like him
and blow it all up.
You wouldn't just wait for death.
Do you have any other excuses?
I don't want to die.
And I want the strength.
But I understood.
I finally got it.
Why did he do that?
Huh?
Everyone I met was the same.
Drinking, women, even the faith in God.
Family, king, dream, child, strength.
Everyone in this life needs to cling to something.
Everyone has their own anchor.
Even him.
What do you have?
Huh, hero?
Kenny, tell me everything you know.
For what reason did the king not want to save humanity?
I have no idea.
But we, the Ackermans, were against it.
Because of this...
As far as I understand, I am also an Ackerman.
Who...
Who were you to my mother?
Huh, fool.
I'm her older brother.
That day, the Ackerman was killed.
That day.
Why?
Why did you leave?
Because I didn't suit my father's role.
Kenny...
And this girl defeated that huge giant?
Yes.
All the residents of Orwood saw it with their own eyes.
Such a little girl was able to protect us from the giant?
Her father was behind the former government, but she overthrew his tyranny.
The true ruler of the walls.
Long live history!
Allow me to finish this giant myself.
If we succeed, we will be able to unite the people and resolve conflicts.
I can't even believe what she did.
Wait.
Are you really going to do this?
Yes, I will.
Mikasa was just joking.
Isn't that true?
How are you going to hit him, tell him.
I'll try to hit back.
Come on.
If you're not angry, then don't.
And then how am I going to consider myself a queen?
Well done, history.
That's the spirit.
Ow!
Ouch!
Girl,
I'm your queen,
and if you don't like me,
then I'll make you mine.
Come on.
Wait a second...
I don't like that raincoat.
What if you don't like it?
Thank you, everyone.
Reiner!
I've won.
Eni's rescue can wait.
The coordinates are in priority, as planned.
If we stay here, he'll come to us himself.
