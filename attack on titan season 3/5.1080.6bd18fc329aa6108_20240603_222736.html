        <pre>My patience is over.
Look up, you morons!
Where is Ernekristo?
Useless!
If you don't surrender,
every captured scout will get a loop on his neck!
I entrusted you with something, X-Assault.
I will only observe.
You will decide.
You and me.
Can't lie, my dear.
Just like this,
I'm dreaming.
The wings of a bloodthirsty wolf
are spreading.
That's the truth.
I want to believe.
Like a fallen angel,
in the wind of time,
washed away and falling
into the starry night.
I want to believe.
Like a fallen angel,
in the wind of time,
flying to heaven.
Episode 4.
The Answer.
Episode 4.
There's a lot of wagons.
Why would that be?
Didn't you know?
Right now, the whole top of the military is gathered in the palace.
The fate of the scout corps is decided there.
You see?
Their commander will hang them on this hangar.
While we're talking here, the trial is going on.
When the scout corps is disbanded,
you take the sword from the whole of humanity.
Instead of eternal defense behind the shield,
it's more reasonable to eliminate the threat with a sword.
Let's assume that now the Rose Wall will fall.
All the residents of the Rose Wall will have to run and hide behind the wall of strength.
The supplies are exhausted.
The food will be enough for a couple of days.
And if we're lucky.
And we won't have time to blink.
The real struggle for survival will begin.
Rose and strength.
Humanity will be divided.
And the civil war will begin.
Even without the threat of invasion of the giants,
the Rose Wall has enough food problems.
The walls of strength are not threatening the giants at all.
The residents of the Rose Wall are much more dangerous.
Maria's return to the Wall.
Only this can give humanity hope for the future.
You mean to say that we need scouts for this?
The scouts were created to attack the enemy.
Hiding behind the walls is not an option.
Or do you have a plan that will help you get out of this situation?
Erwin.
I'm afraid you don't quite understand.
You're not here at all to discuss the future of humanity.
And it's not even about the murder you committed.
Humanity Act, Act Six.
Well.
It will be your turn.
Then it's my turn.
My turn?
Hey, are you joking?
You never left the building on the first day.
At dawn, those who showed up seemed to understand what it was like.
So, when you left the building, you really missed it.
So what are you carrying?
Cover.
Flank.
It is unacceptable to leave the experience of observing only one body.
And yet you preferred to stick to your plan.
You are to blame not only for the imitation of the kidnapping of Eren Yeager,
but also for the death of Dima Reeves involved in the kidnapping.
Your betrayal is obvious.
You are without exaggeration a threat to humanity.
Commander Pixis.
The garrison and the reconnaissance corps are constantly fighting side by side.
How do we know that you are not on the same side with them?
I am outraged that you suspect me of talking to the scouts.
There is nothing more senseless than a murder of someone like that.
In our tight world, inside the walls, any spark can burn everything to the ground.
When the time came to defend the Throst district,
I said this to the soldiers before sending them to death.
If the scouts became that very spark, it must be extinguished.
And in the end, if we manage to break through each other before all the walls fall,
what will become of the poor giant?
Enough. We need to discuss everything.
Your Majesty, may I?
Erwin, is this what you wanted?
So, on behalf of the king, I declare your sentence.
Erwin Smith.
For the violation of the Sixth Act of the Human Rights Act, you are sentenced to death.
The sentence will be executed immediately. Take him.
Everything is going according to plan, Erwin.
You were counting on this one?
The Rose Wall! It just fell!
A colossal one appeared out of nowhere.
Together with the armored giant, they broke through the gates of the Throst district.
At the moment, the refugees from the East are heading here.
Set up an evacuation route.
Immediately gather all the garrison forces and send them to protect the East.
Send all the refugees to the wall of the Throst district.
Move! The main priority is to protect the civilians.
Yes!
No!
Immediately close all the gates of the Throst district!
Do not let any of the refugees in!
What?
But this is the entire population of the Rose Wall.
You order us to allow the death of half of humanity?
Everything is going according to plan.
You order us to allow the death of half of humanity?
Everything is going according to plan, Erwin.
This will lead to a civil war.
We cannot allow the loss of power, otherwise everything is over.
But the chance of such an outcome is not so great.
This chance is enough to start acting.
The power of the government must be indisputable.
Start acting!
Damn!
And it was necessary to collapse the wall at such a moment!
However, we still have hope.
We finally found the power.
We just have to wait until it fills the court.
Right.
We should not worry about such trifles.
While the wall of the Throst is in control.
Yes.
When Lord Royce comes back.
Let's do it!
Close the gates!
Wait!
Then it will be too late!
Who chooses?
Who decides this?
What are you waiting for? Move!
Obedience is equal to betrayal!
I will not!
What?
Hey!
I am a resident of the Wall of the Rose.
I will not allow the gates to be closed!
Fool!
And I will support him.
The wall of the Rose!
Dorius...
Such things?
You expected another reaction from them, General Zpecially?
No, I did not expect
Zpecially?
What does it mean?
It was a false alarm.
Do not worry.
It seems the majority of the police centers are now somewhere far away.
I think we're very lucky.
What are you talking about?
Just recently, I said that the garrison would not support the intelligence legion.
But I forgot something else.
I will not accept your side either.
To be honest, I don't know what you're talking about.
I was ready to leave it all up to you,
if your decision would go to the good of humanity.
And in the end, you're wiser than us,
when it comes to knowledge of giants.
If you really cared about saving lives,
I would agree to send you to the garrison.
But I don't know what you're talking about.
If you really cared about saving lives,
I would agree to send Erwin to the garrison.
Moreover, you're right.
All of us would agree to lose our heads.
However, you clearly gave us an idea of what you wanted.
Even if we don't know about giants and what they're capable of,
but in my opinion, people like us are capable of saving much more people.
You're all idiots!
What will you achieve by undermining our reputation?
Our people will not listen to you!
The word of the king is the law for them!
A simple lord should not comply with this!
It seems you don't quite understand.
It's not just a threat.
It's a coup!
The capture of the police and the center has been successfully completed.
The thing is that the soldier obeys the king's command.
Especially when the king is not real.
We will appoint a new ruler.
Do they really know?
Do you think you can do it?
If the giants really attacked,
your decision would violate the sixth act of humanism.
Moreover, for the replacement of the king and the full usurpation of power,
isn't it supposed to be death?
Bastard!
Wake up, you idiot!
What? Is it time?
Shut up, you stupid ram!
Erwin, victory is yours.
Are you satisfied?
Nile,
humanity is only at the beginning of a new path.
Now everything is much more dangerous.
That's it.
The revolution is over.
The capital and the entire center are now under the control of General Zocley.
So far, the nobles have not taken any action.
By the way, what about Rives?
Thanks to new evidence, all the accusations have been removed.
And his son Flegel was able to escape.
How do you not understand?
The government doesn't give a shit about saving ordinary people.
I admit it, it's not too late.
He's right.
If the giants attack again, there will be nothing left.
No company, no family.
Let's write the truth, until it happens.
How is it written there?
The government was overthrown.
All accusations have been removed.
And King Fritz is recognized as self-proclaimed.
All our actions are recognized as self-defense.
In short, we are no longer criminals.
No, it can't be.
The adventure was justified.
Yes.
This is not only the merit of Erwin.
With common efforts, we managed to change this world.
I managed to lose three of my subordinates.
Sorry.
There is still the police from the center.
Their leader, together with Erwin, is hiding somewhere in their history.
We need to find them.
I have one thought.
We'll go there and put an end to this battle.
Sounded by Anilibria.TV
As a result of Erwin's actions, the overthrow of the old regime occurred.
This was highlighted as soon as the military seized control of the capital and the center.
The announcement was announced by the hangman, which was intended for him.
Exactly.
As General Zakley announced in his speech.
Don't get me wrong.
We do not establish a military dictatorship.
Instead, Fritz will take over the new ruler with the royal family.
It is he who will lead our state.
We don't understand something, but do you really think that the people will simply accept a new ruler?
There is a slight excitement among the citizens.
Who should we trust now?
It would be better for the people if we tolerated the rule of the government.
As Pyxis said, they somehow managed to preserve this world.
Even if they sacrificed half of the population, it is better than a complete extinction.
Maybe I should still give Aaron.
To risk his life and his comrades.
And fully trust the government.
After all, humanity is more valuable than a couple of lives.
Your torments are as painful as ever.
It's easier to die than to make such a choice.
Well then, why did you do otherwise?
Do you want to tell me your reason?
For many years I hated these bastards.
How did they annoy you?
Did they consider themselves important?
No.
It's good that they are.
I sincerely enjoyed this moment.
You know, even if you didn't risk it, I would have done the same before giving up.
And I don't care if this revolution is in favor of humanity.
That bastard, right?
But you are exactly the same.
You didn't want to die.
Just like me.
You put your pride above the fate of all humanity.
And I am quite numerous.
And what is your reason?
Now you tell me.
I have a dream.
I've been a Lillian since I was a child.
Hans, do you know where they are?
Yes.
Now I will explain everything.
Erwin gave me a report on the exploration of the lands of Lord Reiss.
Most of it is information about the incident of five years ago.
Five years?
Right.
On the day of the fall of the wall of Mary.
Now I will tell you all the most important.
The residents of the territory of Reiss have responded quite well to their ruler.
Of the five children, the eldest, Frieda, was very kind to everyone.
And the peasants loved her for this.
But five years ago, at night, a tragedy happened.
Using panic, which engulfed the whole world around,
some bandits robbed and burned down the only chapel in the area.
And how sad it is.
That night, the whole family of Reiss gathered for prayer.
As a result, the whole family, except for the current Lord Reiss,
was cut out by the bandits that night.
In the end, this happened a few days before the mother of history was killed by the center's police.
In other words, right after the death of his family,
Lord Reiss began to look for history.
There must be a reason why he began to hunt for history.
Blood relatives?
Some kind of family secret?
It's hard to say for sure.
But I'm more interested in how he managed to destroy the chapel.
It's completely built out of stone, but its destruction would take a lot of time and effort.
The bandits take everything they can carry and run away.
Besides, only Lord Reiss saw these bandits.
But then he spent a lot of money on restoring the chapel.
But why?
If you think about it, it's very strange that there are no traces of giants there.
Maybe it's too early to draw conclusions.
But it seems to me that we should definitely check this strange place.
I don't know.
What's going on?
Even before dawn, there will be soldiers all over Reiss territory.
But I'm afraid he won't last that long.
If we don't hurry, they can devour Aaron.
If a giant eats someone who has the power of transformation, he inherits these powers.
If it's true...
Aaron, when did he become a giant? Who did he devour to gain power?
Damn it!
Damn it!
History?
Andrey is a hero.
He is a hero!
