        <pre>All nine giants have their own names, including the one that you inherit.
At all times, this giant was only going forward.
He always wanted to be free.
And he fought for freedom.
His name is...
...Attacking Giant.
One day, in the emergency situation of the era, he managed to take control of the pure giants.
When I touch the giants in which the royal blood flows, I may be able to use the power of the giant of the founder.
If I tell them about this, it is not known what the story will be.
Have a family.
A wife, a child, or a simple citizen.
Love someone inside the wall.
If nothing comes out of you, the story will repeat itself.
And someone will make the same mistakes again.
For the sake of Mikasa and Armin, for the sake of everyone else, you must cope.
Mikasa? Armin? Who are they?
I don't know myself.
Whose memories are these?
Mikasa!
Mikasa!
Mikasa!

Episode 10
Peace in the West
The whole world? Our marriage?
If we publish this news, all the inhabitants will be in panic!
I agree! Even we hardly manage to digest the scale of everything that is happening!
Again you want to make trouble for everyone?
You act like King Reiss.
You act like King Reiss.
You will continue to keep the people happy?
If so, then why did we overthrow the government?
How will we differ from them?
We will tell you everything.
100 years ago Reiss took these memories from the people.
Now it's time to return them.
We have one destiny. We all live inside these walls.
And in order to achieve something, we must be united.
All the giants who terrorized us turned out to be humans.
And we belong to the same race called Children and Peace.
Our king, who erected the walls 100 years ago,
changed our memory with the help of the power of the giants,
forcing everyone to believe that there were no people left behind the walls.
But this is not the case. Humanity has not died.
All other races consider children and peace to be real demons.
Very soon the enemy will start an invasion to seize our resources.
The first step was made five years ago,
when the colossal armored walls were built.
Even though we published it, it's hard for me to believe it myself.
At least these data gave an answer to most of our questions.
It is quite natural not to believe such information.
Thank you.
How did people perceive it?
In different ways.
Some believed, some joked.
And the enemies of the military power spread the theory of conspiracy.
As expected, it is not clear.
Yes, but it was necessary.
We must report on the expeditions.
Let the people themselves be in charge of these data.
At least in this we are better than the old king.
Personally, I am proud of you.
And I am an ordinary resident of the walls.
In addition, I belong to the working class.
Thank you.
Then you should write about our successes more often.
What will happen to all of us now?
We hated the giants.
We were afraid of them.
And we were constantly struggling to get rid of this attack.
And it turned out that the whole world thinks of us in the same way.
We are the same monsters to them.
If because of this we will return to the same way through the world,
it means that until we all die, these torments will never end.
Well, hello, great heroes of the walls.
Hitch?
After all, we are the same monsters.
We are the same monsters.
Hitch, did you come after all?
I came to look at how you will be rewarded.
That's how.
Marla died as a hero.
Come on, Floch, tell her.
Okay.
Marla Freudenberg entered the intelligence corps with me.
But he was an example for all of us.
When everyone lost hope.
When our squad was on the verge of destruction.
When everyone else was in panic.
It was he who continued to lead us forward.
That's how.
He was a wonderful man.
I know.
Because of this, he never listened to what I told him.
But it seems to me that in the end he regretted his decision.
Thank you.
It will probably be fun at the ceremony.
Why did you tell this?
Because someone has to tell the truth.
I know that you tried your best to save Commander Erwin's life.
That's right.
I wanted to save the commander, not you.
And I'm not the only one like that.
Everyone thinks so.
Everyone who read the report asked the question.
Why not Erwin?
What do you know about Armin?
Tell me.
Nothing at all.
I was not friends with him when I was a child.
And now we are not comrades.
But I know why they chose Armin.
Because the two of you, together with the captain, gave in to emotions.
In the end, you made a mistake with the choice and used the injection on the wrong person.
All because you didn't have the spirit to sacrifice everything you had.
Listen, you'd better shut up now.
Eren, no matter what I say now, you'll think you did the right thing.
That's why you were so stubborn then.
You're like a capricious child.
Eren, that's enough. Let's go.
Mikasa acted like an adult.
In the end, she still gave in.
What are you doing here?
Flock, this is actually a ceremony in honor of the death of fallen soldiers.
Do you have to raise this topic right now?
I remind you.
You didn't oppose the leadership then.
But Eren and Mikasa didn't try to stop us.
They stood there and kept silent.
Forget about the medals.
Forget about the honor of the fallen.
It's much more important to tell the truth to the next one who wants to enter the reconnaissance corps.
Don't accept cowards like me anymore.
What are we going to do without Commander Erwin now?
I understand perfectly well that cowards like me are worthless.
But we are people too.
And we have our own opinion.
Flock is right about everything.
We should have saved Commander Erwin.
I can't solve our current problem.
Why are you so sure about this?
I'm not sure about anything.
I don't know what's right.
No one can predict the future.
Tell me, do you know what's behind the wall?
Can you tell me what's behind the wall?
The ocean.
That's right. The ocean.
But you haven't seen it yet.
We still don't know anything.
Firewater, icy lands, snowy deserts.
Anything can happen there.
Freedom is waiting for us behind these walls.
Hey, people.
It's time.
Get ready.
What have we found in that basement?
Was it our hope?
Or was it despair?
The enemy was unimaginably strong.
If we don't do anything,
terrible events will happen again.
If it were my life,
I would never give it up.
But I'm not ready to sacrifice history.
What's left for me?
I...
I can't tell you.
I'm Eldin, who lived in the outer world.
I'm the one who saved the world.
I'm the one who saved the world.
I'm Eldin, who lived in the outer world.
I'm the same child and world as you are.
King of Walls, kill all those giants
that have penetrated the walls.
My wife, my son,
all your people can die.
Eren.
At the end of the threesome,
there's a poem about giants
being beaten by a giant hammer.
At the same time, the snow has fallen.
When all the snowdrifts melted,
the intelligence officer said
that there were no more giants
inside Maria's walls.
When the elevators in the threesome were turned on,
the street shopkeepers began to sell.
The flowers were already blooming
and the butterflies were humming.
The refugees were sent back to their native lands.
From the day of the attack on the Thrust,
only one year had passed.
And then,
six years after the first appearance
of the colossal giant,
the intelligence officer again opened the expedition
to the Wall of Maria.
You were right, Henge.
Almost all the giants have passed the Wall of Maria.
Only a year has passed,
and we killed almost all of them.
Well, then, to our goal,
we can go to Primek.
We can go to Primek.
Giant!
We've met at least one!
Be careful!
There he is!
Can he even move?
With such a body,
he could always get to our walls.
He's trying to move!
He was sent to Paradis.
He's from our people.
Let's go.
We're close.
Hey!
We're gonna leave him like that!
We're not gonna kill him!
Damn!
It's that place.
It's here.
The Ldiites turned to the giants.
So,
we need to go.
But I don't want to die.
I've got to find the way.
I need to find the way.
I've got to find the way.
I've got to find the way.
I've got to find the way.
There's a path.
There's a path.
So it's right behind the wall.
So it's right behind the wall.
So it's right behind the wall.
Holy shit!
It's salty!
Is all this water really salty?
What is this?
Kanji, what if this thing is poisonous?
It's just like I said, Eren.
There's so much salt in this huge lake
that not a single merchant can shake it out.
Just like I thought.
It really exists.
Yeah.
It's so huge.
Hey, Eren, can you see behind the walls?
The ocean.
And behind it,
our freedom.
I've always believed in that.
But I was wrong.
The only thing that awaits us there
are the enemies.
It's still the same.
That's what I saw in my father's memories.
And what if
we kill all the enemies
that are waiting for us there?
Will we be
truly free?
