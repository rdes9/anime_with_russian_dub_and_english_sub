        <pre>One of the houses will turn out to be the house of the Yeager!
Sasha, smash the horses on the head!
It looks like he doesn't know where we are.
Yeah, he's throwing the burning bombs.
Soon the whole Shigansh will catch fire.
You bastard!
So you decided to burn down my city?
Armin!
Fire close!
Command!
Hurry up!
Just look at yourself.
You're just shaking from fear.
You're not capable of anything else.
Jean, can you replace me?
I can't even imagine what to do.
I made a mistake about Bertold, and now we're looking into the consequences.
Jean, you can do it better than me.
River!
We're going to the river!
Get on Aaron and save the gas!
Aaron, we're going to need to get Bertold's attention soon.
But don't stick out yet.
Armin.
I can think tactically, but I don't have a plan to solve this situation.
So the strategy is up to you.
Armin!
Armin!

The End
The cleaning is complete, there are almost no small ones left, only a few in front, but it is still not clear what to do with a beast like that, he digs well there, he will not approach.
Yes, he is afraid of us, I immediately realized that he has no eggs.
Have a rest for now, we will deal with the small ones ourselves. Go!
Yes!
Damn it, what kind of explosion is this? What's wrong with the others? Hange and the guys didn't get hurt, we need to go that way.
I took a little high, leave it there.
Well, it seems to have softened, I will have an ideal game.
We are under fire, all troops to cover!
What is it?
Damn it, guys!
What was that noise?
They also have cannons!
Then there are no less than hundreds of them!
Calm down, you scare the horses!
The giant throws stones!
Captain Levi!
Take all the horses and run to the wall!
Yes!
Hurry up, get out of the line of fire!
Get up, do you want to die?
Commander!
How is the situation?
Terrible, he destroyed all the houses with his throws. If this continues, he will demolish all the buildings, and then we will have nowhere to hide.
Can't we step back to that side?
No, the colossal giant is already coming to us, he burns everything on his way.
Besides, if we hide from the stones on that side, we will have to throw the horses. If we step back, we can forget about the victory.
What about the Hanje detachment? Is Aaron still alive?
I don't know, most of the detachment was covered by the explosion wave. We have very serious losses.
The beast-like organized the attack in such a way that our troops gathered in one place.
As a result, the detachments of all those who fought against the giants, the Dirk detachment, the Marlen detachment and the Klaus detachment, were killed under fire.
And so, only the Nobobranians, Captain Levi and, of course, myself remained on this side of the wall.
Aaron, no!
Erwin, do you have any plans?
Scream, Aaron! You can't let Bertolt get any closer to the wall!
Got it!
What? This freak ignores us!
Hey, what do we do, John? He's right now!
I know! Aaron, grab this dildo by the leg!
And then? How do we fight him?
Because of his pair, our UPMs are useless! Have you forgotten?
I remember!
But there's no choice. We have to do something. Let's find his weak spot!
I'll try. And you distract him. Coney, give me a copy.
Here you go!
Erwin, and you will have to watch from afar.
Oh, damn it! We have to believe that we can win!
Now! Let's go!
Don't look at me from afar. The bigger the closet, the more it falls!
He moved!
Come on, Aaron! Get him!
There must be some way!
Aaron!
Hey, is that Aaron?
Did I really hit him on the wall?
It's huge!
Aaron's not moving!
He's alive!
Focus on the monster!
That was pretty predictable.
That's what happens when you act without any plan.
Now, if we can't handle him, the whole end of this operation,
and ourselves, and humanity itself, will be in danger!
So, I'm not going to sit around here waiting for death!
Attack everyone!
You don't know about the Grom copy yet!
Coney and I will distract him!
And Mikasa will strike!
Yes, sir!
Hey, you bastard! I'm going to stab you in the eye right now!
You big idiot!
You cheeky demon!
Our actions are obvious.
But if we manage to use the copy...
Coney!
Guys!
It didn't work!
The pressure of the steam even pushed the Grom copy away!
Coney!
Damn it! I hit the hot air!
Mikasa, are you hurt?
I'm sorry.
I hit the Grom copy with shards.
I'll think of something.
I have an idea.
How do we fight them?
No.
The power of the colossal burns his muscle tissue for the generation of steam.
The resources of his body are endless.
The beast-like guy figured out where we were hiding.
Soon he'll settle everything here.
Erwin, if you think there's a chance of success,
it's time to step back.
Get up and be Erwin.
Gather as many people as possible and run.
At least we'll save someone.
Hey!
The horse ran away!
You're responsible for it!
Shut up!
What's the difference now?
What did you say?
Those scouts were very strong and still died instantly!
You understand everything yourself!
What's the point of defending horses
if there's no one to ride them home?
They told us everything.
If people sit down behind the walls,
the giants will appear and eat them all.
That's why someone has to make up their mind
and start acting.
You have to live to be with yourself.
If you don't want to,
you have to die for someone else.
And when we were asked
who would be brave enough,
I believed for some reason
that I would become a brave man.
But I didn't think
that everything would turn out like this,
that the price of my life
would be so insignificant.
Most soldiers probably give up their lives
with the same thoughts.
Why did I even decide
that I was going to have a different fate?
What if one of Hanji's troops survived?
We'll let them see the horses
and let them try to break through.
And while they're distracted,
you and the others will escape on the iron.
Lev, what are you going to do?
I'm going to fight a beast like him.
I'll try to take him away.
It's impossible.
You can't even get close to him.
It's possible.
But if you run away with the iron,
we'll have hope.
I think this is the best way
to get out of our position.
We've lost.
Honestly,
I think we're all going to go
and feed the giants soon.
Yes,
if we can't counterattack.
Can we?
Yes.
Why didn't you say anything before?
Hurry up and spread your ideas.
If the plan works,
you'll have a chance
to deal with the beast like him.
But I have to give up my life
with the recruits.
As you said,
most of us
will die anyway.
No.
I'm almost sure
that we'll all die.
Thus,
we heroically sacrifice ourselves
for a chance to win.
So that the recruits
willingly go to death,
I'll have to sacrifice myself.
I'll have to sacrifice myself.
I'll have to sacrifice myself.
I'll die.
I'll have to use all of my brain wash
and skills.
Nobody will go to attack
if I don't personally lead them.
So, I'll die first.
I can't find out
what's in that basement.
What?
I want to go down to the basement.
I've been living here until now.
I hope that this day will finally come.
The day when I'll check my theories.
Very often I thought it was easier to die,
but every time I thought it was easier to die.
And now I'm here.
All that's left is to reach out with my hand.
They're so close.
Tell me, Levy,
do you see our comrades?
Do you see our comrades?
Do you see our comrades?
Do you see our comrades?
They're watching us.
They want to know why they gave their hearts.
Because their battle is not over yet.
Or is it my imagination?
Are they stupid children's illusions?
You fought well.
Only thanks to you we've come so far.
I'll decide for you.
Give up your dream and die.
Lead the recruits to the right death.
I'll destroy the beast like you.
Attack!
Well, I didn't think they'd stay there to die.
But the frontal attack?
I expected more from them.
Now! Fire!
Smoke?
Ah, it's a signal missile.
Attack!
Disperse!
I declare our last operation.
Get ready!
We'll make a cavalry throw.
The target of the attack is a beast-like giant.
And we will become a great target for the enemy.
Therefore, right in front of his throw,
we will use signal missiles.
It will be more difficult for him to aim.
While we distract the enemy,
Captain Levy will kill the beast-like giant.
This is our plan.
What?
Do you want me to get to him on UPM?
He stands in a clear field.
There are no houses or trees nearby.
No.
But a whole range of objects of the desired height leads to him.
I use giants to get to the beast-like giant.
Ah!
I'm sorry.
We'll stay here and we'll be covered in stones.
Get ready for the attack!
Tell me, we're all going to die.
That's right.
And if we die, it's better to give up our lives in the last battle.
That's right.
But if death is inevitable, then why all this?
You can't follow orders.
We'll die anyway.
You're absolutely right.
There's no point in that.
It doesn't matter what your dreams and hopes are.
It doesn't matter how happy life you've lived.
You'll be killed anyway.
Everyone will die one day.
But is life meaningless?
Did we come to this world in vain?
And what about the dead comrades?
Their deaths were also in vain.
Not at all!
It's us who give meaning to their lives.
Brave fathers, unhappy fathers,
only the living are able to give respect to the dead.
We will give our lives to fill their lives with meaning.
That's the only way we can resist this cruel world.
Show your rage!
Show your scream!
Show your struggle!
