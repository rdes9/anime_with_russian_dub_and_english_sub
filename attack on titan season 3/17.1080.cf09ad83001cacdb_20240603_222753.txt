We will give our lives to live and fill them with meaning, because only in this way we can resist this cruel world.
Show the rage, show the cry, show the struggle!
Commander!
Do not retreat! Forward!
Do not retreat! Forward!
Do not retreat! Forward!
Episode 5. The Hero
Episode 5. The Hero
What a pitiful sight. These enemies do not learn from their mistakes.
It is sad that the King of Paradise has taken away from them the memories of the world.
They do not know the history of their people.
In fact, he killed them with his actions.
Everyone is doomed to a rightful death.
And all this is justified by some nonsense about a worthy death.
Disgusting!
The stone is scattered in the dust.
What is it with me?
There is nothing to be nervous about.
I do not look like my father.
Things need to be done with pleasure.
Well, now it's time to separate these guys from the fight.
Throw it! Now! Fire!
That's it!
Here it is! Death!
I wonder where Hitch is now.
He must be asleep.
Great!
And what have I forgotten here?
Yes! The end of the game!
Did you see? I changed the type of presentation.
I think I respected everyone.
Fire!
And what's next?
What's the point in this stupid smoke?
What are you trying to achieve with your nasty shouts?
Poor guys.
What is it?
My giants are dead.
What?
Shouldn't I be afraid of any of them?
Yes, Captain Levi is dangerous.
Is this Levi?
To the back of the head!
What is it?
I do not see anything.
Did he pierce the eyes?
The legs!
It was pretty fun for you.
The armor!
No, I do not have time!
Let's have fun together!
No!
Your transformation is wasting a lot of energy,
so you can't turn around now.
Am I right?
Hey, answer me!
Where is your manner?
I can't kill him.
Maybe someone is still alive.
At least someone.
Even if he barely breathes,
we can inject him and turn him into a giant.
Feed him with this freak and get the power of the chosen one.
If we do this,
we will save at least one life.
Let's go!
Where are you going?
Levi, kill him!
You made me, Levi!
It hurts!
But now you have nothing left.
We will finish the rest.
Let him barely die,
but victory is ours!
Wait.
I gave him a cage.
I promised to kill you.
I promised!
Why am I still alive?
Who was it?
Hey!
Is there anyone alive here?
Bastard!
He's still alive!
He can be killed!
He can be killed!
How can we fight
against such an enemy?
Listen, Armin,
we need to try to save Aaron.
He's gotten thinner.
The colossal giant
has gotten a little thinner.
Hanji was right.
We can beat the colossal one
in the battle of exhaustion.
Do you remember Aaron's experiments?
He turned three times in a row.
And this 15-meter one,
the 60-meter one
should require much more energy.
When he attacks with steam,
his flesh is consumed
as fuel for the attack.
Only the skeleton remains.
What are you leaning towards?
Armin.
I have a plan.
Go and save Reiner.
And Bertelda,
leave Aaron with us.
Just the two of us.
It's enough to beat him.
Okay.
We'll deal with Reiner.
You've been thinking for a long time.
I thought we were done for.
I don't know why,
but when it comes to freedom,
the power overflows me.
If the plan works,
I don't think I'll ever be able
to see Reiner again.
For some reason,
when I think about the outside world,
my fears recede.
Aaron, get up!
It's time to go to the ocean!
Aaron,
get up!
It's time to go to the ocean!
It's time to go to the ocean!
The information is available.
They say that behind the walls
are the lands of miracles
that are hard to even imagine.
Aaron,
that's the whole plan.
All that's left
is to make it happen.
If we can fool Bertelda,
victory
will be ours.
Listen,
we have to believe that Armin and Aaron
will beat Bertelda.
The main thing is not to let Reiner
get in the way of their plans.
That's why we can't let him get to them.
Let's make it happen.
향 убежал?
Beaf!
It's personal.
Let's fight him then.
Mikasa!
Hey!
If we can't distract him, all we can do is try to kill him.
We have to protect Eren and Armin.
I knew it.
We only have three spears left.
Damn, that's not enough.
We have to try.
After all, we can't win without a fight.
What is this?
What am I supposed to do?
I don't know.
What is this?
What am I supposed to do?
It pierced my armor.
What happened after that conversation?
I'm going to blow everything up here.
If you can, put the giant on your back and hide under it.
Bertha.
What happened to me?
I don't understand anything.
There's almost no power left.
However, Eren is still here.
If we capture him, our mission will be completed.
So, Bertha, we have to deal with them and go to him for help.
Four are left to distract Reiner.
For some reason, after the explosion, only the guys from the 104th issue survived.
It would be better if all of them were killed by the blast wave.
But I won't worry about you anymore, Armin.
What's the use of Aron when he's in such a state?
Well, go ahead.
Show me what you've prepared for the end.
Of course, I came up with this plan myself.
But his success completely depends on how long I can hold on.
Armin, are you really true?
Eren, I'm not going to die until I see the ocean.
As soon as it smells like fried food, I'll leave right away.
The rest is up to you.
You know, I'm not brave enough.
No, it's not true.
I know you're...
Eren, do you believe me?
We promised to see the ocean together.
Have I ever lied to you?
No matter what, stick to my plan.
You bastard!
Eren!
I knew it. The battle is over.
He's got a lot on his mind.
He can't even stand on his feet normally.
That's enough.
It's time to finish.
It's time to finish.
Armin, you fought well until the very end.
Eren!
Armin!
No, I have to believe in them.
We have to deal with Reiner.
If there's a chance to beat Reiner with three copies of Grom, then only this one.
We have to act until he can't move.
We'll finish him now.
This is our last battle.
Attack.
Reiner!
I'll distract him first.
Sasha's horses will take two spears and beat him in the jaw from both sides.
Sasha!
Sasha!
Joan!
One missed.
If we damage the jaw, the mouth must open!
Mikasa will take the last spear and break his back through the mouth!
The mouth didn't open, but we still have to try!
Why?
Why didn't he fall back?
Why didn't the hook fall back?
He can't get me anyway!
I was right!
The bones and teeth don't evaporate!
The hook wouldn't hold on to the muscles for so long!
Besides, he can't move during a pair of attacks!
It's all Armin!
Your prediction is right!
And such an idea was born by your genius mind!
It's so easy!
Burn to the ground from my heat!
There's nothing to breathe!
That's my limit!
No! It's too early!
That's not enough!
We need to win more time!
Why are you doing this?
Are you distracting me?
Armin didn't move at all!
Mikasa and the others are busy with Reiner!
You couldn't come up with a plan?
Are you really so desperate?
Okay.
I'll give you peace.
Hold on!
Don't let go!
I gave it to Armin!
Armin!
Armin!
Armin!
My dream, my life, everything!
I have nothing left!
I have nothing to lose!
I believe...
...that Eren...
...will get to the ocean!
He'll see it...
...instead of me!
Mikasa!
Don't!
No!
Let's keep going!
Kanji!
Come on!
Mikasa!
It can't be!
Reiner!
Get out!
That's it.
Now I'll take care of Eren and the horses.
It's...
...a trap!
He's gone!
It's a trap!
It's a trap!
From the very beginning, Eren was just pretending to be weak.
Armin was after me...
...to win him some time...
...to prove himself!
They wanted me to decide...
...that there was no one around me.
I bought myself...
...and lost my vigilance!
Did I ever lie to you?
Damn!
I figured it out right away.
Tell me...
...why aren't you giving up?
They're going to torture you.
Aren't you tired of losing?
I...
...didn't lose.
I didn't run away.
Listen.
What's your name?
I always knew...
...that you...
...were braver than all of us.
The sequel follows.
The End
The End
The End
Eren and his friends win a tough battle.
But...
...the victory was too expensive.
Then...
...the White Night.
