        <pre>Hi, Lamy.
What, you haven't grown up yet?
I see you haven't lost your grip.

Episode 2
Pain
Fire!
What happened?
Sit still!
History!
Sheeran!
Take this!
Damn!
They read every step of ours!
Genie!
Why is he messing with the military police?
It's Levi from the Corps Intelligence!
Welcome!
Welcome!
Damn!
With this pace, I'm going to lose the history of Heron!
What a disgrace!
There's a lot of rats coming out of this bar!
Come on, get out, little rat!
Got you!
Now the professional will get rid of the parasites!
Bam-bam!
What?
Well, where is he?
I'm here, Genie.
Long time no see.
I thought you died a long time ago.
What happened to the military killers?
Are you one of them now?
Sometimes the actions of adults can't be understood by children.
Oh, mistake.
I still can't believe that such a rat can be an adult.
It wasn't interesting to see you in the children's room.
I didn't think that you would use all my tricks in such a way.
I'm teaching you what happens when you're cornered by rats.
Where the hell would you run?
They'll still knock you down from above.
Listen, Levi.
You entered the intelligence not just like that.
I can guess the reason.
We had to survive in that hole.
Every day we had to fight for our lives.
When we found out how great this world was,
we finally got out of it.
But we still made it.
We found a job for ourselves.
That's all.
That's the essence of life.
The search for entertainment warms the blood in the heart.
Entertainment?
So you were just having fun with my comrades?
Yeah.
I'm ready to send the corpses on their way to their main goal.
And you kill the same one for the sake of profit.
Yeah.
Wait!
Captain!
I'm coming back. Thanks.
I'm coming back. Thanks.
I'm coming back. Thanks.
A chair?
What?
Fire!
Fire!
Over there!
There's...
There's a fire!
Something went wrong?
Most likely.
The captain left a message.
From now on, not only giants, but also our enemies.
What do you mean?
Was that the first squad?
You need to check the papers.
Captain, are you dead?
Are you stupid?
If I were dead, how would I answer you?
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Good.
I remembered that there is a bar for self-defense of weapons.
You're already quite grown up.
That's great, Vitya.
What's that?
My dream is still far away.
Hey, there's Aaron!
Captain!
What's that?
Behind the cart!
Yes, sir!
Remember, they're used to fighting people.
The three of them are dead.
If you want to get them back, don't bother.
Kill them right away.
Got it?
Got it.
Armin, Jean, behind the cart.
We'll cover you.
Yes, sir!
Suicide.
Jean!
Don't move!
Jean!
The capital of Mitra.
It's a shame that we didn't get anything from Erwin.
Aaron, Jaeger and history are still missing.
There is a possibility that we have frozen the activity of the intelligence corps in vain.
That's right.
Is it known that Pastor Nick had time to tell them?
It's hard to say.
If you ask questions, you can accidentally reveal to them what they didn't know.
No.
It doesn't matter how much they know.
They tried to find out.
And that's enough.
We need to stick to the law.
Just like we did before.
This is from Reiss.
Aaron and history are captured.
He has already spoken against Erwin's scouts.
We don't have to interfere.
This is the last one.
All your personal things will be returned, but later.
No, I don't need it.
I wanted to talk to you.
I'm not in the mood to talk right now.
It's cold, Nile.
We wanted to go on a reconnaissance together.
This closed world will soon change.
Good or bad.
Can you trust the future of humanity?
Who chooses?
Who will decide?
Who will you trust?
Erwin, are you up to something again?
It's an adventure, as always.
You went through it too.
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Damn it!
Armin!
Jean!
Enough!
Back off!
Aaron!
Aaron!
Aaron!
What's wrong with you?
Can't you get into your throat in such mud?
No.
Jean, I don't understand.
What?
When I was shooting to save you,
I was sure I wouldn't make it in time.
I'm sorry, but...
Why did I shoot faster?
Because...
Because that girl got in the way.
Right.
Armin, I'm sorry.
I should have done it.
I think I understand.
The one I killed was a good person.
She was much more human than me.
I just pressed that trigger.
I...
Armin, now your hands are covered in blood.
You will not be the same anymore.
Why are you saying that?
It remains only to accept it.
If you didn't want to get your hands dirty,
Jean wouldn't have been with us.
Do you know why you missed the lesson?
You were worried about your friend's life.
Armin, thanks to this deed,
all your friends survived.
Thank you.
Captain Levi,
at first I thought it was wrong to fight people.
I thought your order was wrong.
I was afraid to harm people.
But...
I was wrong.
Next time I'll shoot.
I don't think I was right.
I don't know for sure.
You made a big mistake.
Okay.
It's time to hear what he has to say.
Wait, I just had to deliver the load.
Nothing more.
I've already seen him.
He made a lot of noise in the city.
Yes, I know.
Are you Dima Reeves?
No.
We were just following the orders of the military police.
We were very confused.
Now they will not leave Reeves to me.
And by killing me and my stupid son,
they will not calm down.
All my people in the canals will rot.
And you will not resist?
The rope is now only miraculously held.
And all thanks to the work of Reeves's company.
But if the company falls apart,
how long will it last until the end of winter?
So what?
Do you suggest uniting?
We just need to find out where the history is.
You are the supplier of the military police.
We will play on this.
Can you prevent the hungry death of my city?
I do not guarantee.
However, we will definitely try to do something about it.
Well, at least one trouble has passed.
Erwin!
Problems!
The situation has deteriorated.
Two news.
First, the RNA history has been stolen.
And three of my squad have died.
I'm going to Levi's right now.
And there we will think about how to return them.
So, and the second?
Aaron remembered the conversation between Mir and Berteld.
Well, if it turns out to be true,
my head will burst now.
Hold yourself in your hands.
So, what's the matter?
If we do not hurry,
Aaron will eat us.
Hey, is Levi really there with his people?
True.
I promised to cooperate,
and for some reason he believed me.
Here we are.
Reeves, you bastard!
You are sorry, my friends.
Do you believe them?
Now we can not be afraid, dad.
There are no guarantees.
What?
Are you kidding me?
The trader must trust his gut.
Do not look for easy money.
Look for what will bring profit in the future.
And when you find it,
get your teeth into it.
Got it?
Here, remember.
And here I am.
Are you not finished yet?
Uh-huh.
I have a little experience.
Sanas,
I've never been tortured either.
So you'll have to put up with it.
Wait!
What?
What do you want?
Ask first, and then try!
Right, we have a couple of questions.
Where is Aaron and Historia?
Why do you need Historia?
Who are the Reiss?
Time.
See that we are in a hurry.
It started again.
When Levi was doing them,
it was not so loud.
I understand that this is for the sake of saving the guys,
but I'm not on my own.
To tell the truth,
we are criminals.
Our current enemy,
we fight not because
they are trying to eat us.
They just think differently.
No.
It's not them, it's their leadership.
Because of that, it's their life.
Armin.
We are all
no longer heroes.
Sorry,
I'm not as smart as you are.
How many have you tried to sharpen your skills?
All misfortune.
Do you know
why there was never a war
inside the walls?
It was the first detachment.
We were the ones who
fought to save the world.
Too smart teachers.
Stupid couple
trying to fly away.
Slut with some farm in the deaf.
People haven't died yet
just because of us.
You should be
grateful.
I've never seen anyone
get so much pleasure
from torture.
You monster.
But don't scare me.
I have
faith.
I believe
in the king and the world
inside our walls.
I believe
that all our actions
are justified.
But
I didn't know
how much pain it caused.
Suffer as much as you can.
After all,
all my life
I've only been doing this.
Break.
Bad news.
I even feel sorry for him.
Don't push.
It hurts.
Ralph.
What a shame.
You only had one nail.
Sanus has
no nails left.
He's a totally different person.
What about me?
He decided it himself.
He made a mess
about the king and the world.
We couldn't stand him.
Make a gift.
Kill him.
We won't even think
until he confirms your story.
I've already told you
everything I knew.
Let me rest.
Will you let me sleep or not?
Well, Sanus,
shall we continue?
It's not easy for me either.
But I'll try.
Paradise is the truth, King.
Well,
they wanted to not shine.
Flegel is gone forever.
In trade,
you can't betray your partners.
Maybe we should ask him
where Levi is.
He'll come to us himself.
Are you sure?
But I raised him.
Levi Ackerman
always did that.
He was a good man.
He was a good man.
He was a good man.
The true heir of the throne
is history.
Does it mean
that the era is history?
Most likely,
next to the birth of Reiss.
Here it is.
History.
Forgive me for everything.
