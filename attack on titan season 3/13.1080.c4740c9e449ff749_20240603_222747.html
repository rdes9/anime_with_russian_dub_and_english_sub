        <pre>5 years ago, when humanity lost these lands,
the people who were trapped inside the two remaining walls
decided for themselves that their species was doomed to extinction.
Ordinary people are not destined to defeat giants.
I will kill you!
I will kill you!
I will kill you!
I will kill them!
I will tear them to pieces!
However, the courage that was born in the heart of one boy
hit the giant, whose huge body fell to the ground.
And what did the witnesses of his feat feel?
Someone experienced pride,
someone woke up with hope,
and some shouted with rage.
But what if the wall of Mary can be returned?
What will people feel then?
Will they be able to believe that humanity is worthy of life?
Forward!
Believe in the fact that we decide our fate ourselves.
Will they be able to believe in this proof?
Only by returning to the wall of Mary can you find out.
The future is always a work of art.
Every time you visit the night,
you gently touch our nails with your cold hands.
Betraying the light,
you cling to the back of the burning hope.
Even if you know that you're heading for the hell you've been chasing,
if you want to see what's next,
what will you do?
The devil will make a path with his dead body.
What's on the other side of this wall?
The truth, which we longed for in our childhood days,
is right there, at the end of the dead body's path.
Even if you spread your wings,
the sun will soon sink into the abyss.
That's why
we keep moving
to the other side of the wave.
Episode 1
This is the city where it all began.
Quiet!
Hey, watch your step!
I'm sorry.
It's been a long time.
The dawn is coming.
As soon as we cross the mountain,
we'll find ourselves in Shigan.
I'm sorry I didn't see the horse myself.
You need to take care of your health.
I understand.
She's talking business.
Relax, Eren.
Bullshit!
Sorry.
Our enemies can be everywhere.
There's a giant on the left!
Stop!
Give me the light!
Great.
He's asleep.
Looks like he's not one of those who wanders at night.
What a pity.
Let him sleep.
I can't believe we only noticed him.
I agree with you.
But it's a moonless night.
We can only rely on it.
The moon reflects the sun's light.
We believe
that new types of giants use this light
to move around at night.
We should have waited for the new moon.
There's no guarantee
that the ray won't come back.
This baby could be
a moon giant.
I wish we could catch one.
I'm shaking.
Why?
Why did you scare me?
Damn it.
What if I go astray
and can't get Maria back?
How many people do I lose hope for?
There's no other chance for humanity.
What if it's not my destiny?
Can someone like me save humanity?
How can I do it?
I'm scared.
Eren, why are you shaking?
Are you scared?
What?
I'm not scared.
Don't lie.
My hand is shaking.
I'm cold.
My whole hand is frozen.
See?
My whole hand is shaking.
See?
Have you ever been afraid of giants?
Usually everyone is afraid of them.
For example, when I first met them,
I couldn't even move.
But at that moment,
you followed me into the giant's den.
How did you even dare to do that?
I remember
how you showed me that book.
I didn't even think about
the world behind the wall before.
I was just staring at the clouds every day.
But one day
I heard your story
and saw the fire in your eyes.
You had a wonderful dream.
I didn't have enough of that.
Then I realized
that I wasn't free.
I was locked in a cage.
I was captured by these monsters.
When I realized that,
I hated them.
I don't know why,
but when it comes to freedom,
the power overflows me.
Thank you.
I feel better now.
I'm sure
that during this year
we will see the sea.
I know where to go.
I think
we went here for the firewood.
We're at the foot of the river.
There's a road left.
We're so close.
I hear the river.
Finally.
We're back.
For the first time
since we ran away.
We're back home.
Take care of the hidden giants.
Start the operation.
Let's go to our UPMs.
We need to seal two exits.
The inside and the outside.
Then Shiganshin will be isolated.
Then we'll finish off the remaining giants.
If the enemy reveals our plan,
he'll try to find Aaron.
But we have hundreds of soldiers.
They'll all be in the hood.
While the enemy is looking for Aaron,
we'll seal the outer gates.
Don't stop!
Go to the outer gates.
Yes, sir!
It's...
the firewood.
They're close.
Bertolt and Reiner.
My house is very close.
There.
Where I was before.
Great.
I'll get him back.
It's weird.
Where did all the giants go?
We need to keep going.
Yes.
There's no reason to retreat.
I can do it.
No.
We can do it.
Because all of us
were born special.
We're free!
We're free!
Don't lose your vigilance.
Look around.
Yes.
Aaron, how's your UPM?
It's fine.
But I lost my coat.
You lost your coat?
I lost my coat.
You lost your coat?
I lost my coat.
You lost your coat?
I lost my coat.
I lost my coat.
I lost my coat.
Thank you.
Hello.
Everything's fine.
The hole is sealed.
It worked.
Aaron, how are you?
I'm fine.
Now to the inner gate.
Make sure you let them in.
The hoods aren't sleeping.
I sealed the hole.
And it's that simple?
You did it.
Believe in your strength.
That's the hole.
Not yet.
No matter how hard they try,
as long as Reiner and Bertolt are alive,
you can't consider the operation a success.
Of course.
I understand.
The outer gates are sealed.
And yet, it's strange.
No joints.
On the contrary,
there's not a single giant around.
Aren't they ready for our attack?
If only.
Considering the find of Arlert.
I checked.
There was definitely someone's camp here.
The teapot was cold,
and the coals were scattered all over the ground.
They were drinking something like tea.
It smells good.
What is it?
Besides,
there were three cups with the remains of the same drink.
There were at least three people here.
Did you say three?
Was the teapot cold?
Yes.
That's very strange.
What?
The teapot?
We were driving the horses at maximum speed.
And we were using the UPM.
If they just heard
or saw us,
they had two minutes to react.
The teapot couldn't cool down.
They found out about our arrival
in more than five minutes.
So they had enough time
to prepare.
Wait!
But how?
It turns out that besides the three of them,
there was also a scout on the wall.
No.
We need to get out of the larger number of enemies.
We need to get out of the larger number of enemies.
We need to get out of the larger number of enemies.
Arlert,
your brilliant mind
has helped us many times
out of trouble.
And today
we need you again.
Take as many people as you need.
Take as many people as you need.
Check if the enemies are hiding
at the inner walls.
Now
you are under the command of Armin Arlert.
You are under the command of Armin Arlert.
Continue searching.
Yes!
We searched all the walls.
What are the orders, Arlert?
What are the orders, Arlert?
Send a squad to every side of the wall.
Search every building
at the inner gates.
If you find something,
send a signal.
Everything is clear.
All right.
All right.
Once again?
No.
He showed himself long ago.
His mind is our most powerful weapon.
Arlert is going to seal the gates.
What now?
Stop the operation
and find the enemy?
No.
We continue.
In the long fight on the enemy territory
we will lose.
The only chance is a quick and decisive victory.
And even
if everything goes according to the plan of the enemy,
we just have to accept it.
Besides,
not only they
have something to hide.
What to do?
Eren is going to seal the inner gates.
Eren is going to seal the inner gates.
And we still don't know where our enemy is.
And we still don't know where our enemy is.
We sealed the walls.
And we still don't know where our enemy is.
Why can't we find them?
Why can't we find them?
Bad.
What to do if we fail?
We're all dead.
We're all dead.
We'll never know
how they're going to attack us.
We're always in an unfavorable position.
We're always in an unfavorable position.
We don't know anything about the giants.
We don't know anything about the giants.
Nothing?
We got no idea.
Don't worry.
Don't worry.
Just ignore the esos.
Ignore their tail.
Ignore their tail.
Ignore their tails.
If our enemy finds them...
if our enemy finds them...
if our enemy finds them...
I've had enough.
I've had enough.
What?
Well,
There should be a space inside the wall where you can hide for a long time.
How do you know?
Intuition.
Do you even understand what situation we are in?
We have no time to check your guess.
Think for yourself.
The enemy always uses the power of giants to get us in trouble.
If we continue to limit ourselves to common sense,
we will never be able to keep up.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Signal to cancel the mission!
Attention!
Distract and stand on the wall!
Yes!
Sometimes instead of a strict plan, you need flexibility.
Follow the oath given at the consecration.
Obey the order.
We came here to win.
Divide into two groups and check the surface.
Pay special attention to the gates.
Start searching.
Yes!
What are they doing?
Are we going to stand here?
Yeah, what an unexpected attack.
Armin, what were you thinking?
A convenient position to react to the appearance of Eren.
A position with a good overview.
Such a place exists only on the walls themselves.
If the enemy believes that we know nothing about the giants inside the walls,
Eren, he thinks that we will never know where he is.
Or not.
Come here!
Get to the wall!
Reiner!
Remember how we lost our way?
Bastard!
Captain?
Still the strength of the giants.
I just couldn't finish him.
Look around! Find his ally!
The wind blows, the wind blows
The wind blows, the wind blows
The wind blows, the wind blows
A balloon is flying towards us!
Lay down!
Help! Help!
What's going on?
Did he miss?
No, he didn't.
He's gone mad.
Now the horses can't go.
He's deprived us of the horses.
And he's taken the ring,
cutting off the way to retreat.
We have similar plans.
To sort things out here and now.
People or giants?
Who's going to live?
And who's going to die?
To be continued...
To be continued...
To be continued...
To be continued...
To be continued...
To be continued...
To be continued...
From nowhere the crowds of giants emerged.
In the midst of a decisive battle,
a friend becomes the enemy,
standing in the way of Eren.
Nice.
