The Observer
Stop!
Come here!
Come on.
Yeah.
That's not what I imagined the queen to be.
And she's been ruling for only two months.
Although she looks more like the host of the shelter.
You know what her people called her?
The Goddess of Sorrow.
In a good sense of the word.
Finally, we have a goddess.
At this rate, everyone will soon forget about the fool who closed the hole in the reed.
One of the reasons why history agreed to become a queen was this.
Why?
Care for the poor orphans living in the underground and on the outskirts.
The captain who grew up in the outskirts also supported her.
She said that if people need help, they need to be helped.
That's what history wants to do.
Hey, cool off again.
It's getting dark soon.
She reminds me more and more of my mother.
The Goddess.
They say the test of confirmation is going to be successful.
Yeah, but if we don't hurry, they'll be back.
What are you going to do?
What if Reiner and Bertelt get back on our way?
I'll have to kill them without hesitation.
I want to know as soon as possible what kind of world it is and why it is so organized.
I definitely won't regret what we did.
Even children from the outskirts started to smile.
So we did the right thing.
Yeah, you're good.
Not at all.
Although someone recently said that people got her.
It just took me a while.
What?
Give it to me.
Hey!
Eren got tired after the experiments.
And the truth.
I'm sorry, Mikasa.
Stop talking to me like a bastard!
After the war, humanity suffered significant losses among talented people.
But we opened up the glowing ore in the caves.
And a lot more.
Also, thanks to Eren's abilities, we developed a new weapon against the giants.
That's it.
Put your head in here.
Come on!
Accurate hits to the back of the head.
Are we really...
We killed 12 meters!
It worked!
Great!
With this thing, you can crush the giants without losing a soldier!
We will chop the giants day and night!
Meet the hellish executioner!
It worked, Eren!
Eren...
I tried too hard with the use of force.
Constant experiments, I must say.
I'm sorry, Eren.
There's nothing to apologize for, Hange.
Who cares about my fatigue?
We must quickly make weapons and go to Shiganshin.
We will win!
We can win!
With the new weapon, we will wipe out the giants with powder!
It hurts, don't burn yourself.
You're the only one who's happy about joining the intelligence.
That's true.
Didn't the hitch try to talk you out of it?
Hitch?
Why would he?
Aren't you the same?
I don't understand what you're talking about.
Hitch read me, said I shouldn't build something cool out of myself.
She said that if I stayed in the police, I could live in peace.
I had a new opinion about her.
So he said he was disappointed.
Shit.
Marlo, are you stupid?
The pot is completely empty.
What's wrong with his words?
In any case, there are only newbies on the platoon now.
They have no experience in combat at all.
Hey, hey.
You can think of us as veterans.
Compared to you, yes.
How rude.
We're all from the 104th.
Besides, we're not the only ones like that.
Right now, the whole people are waiting for the opportunity to return the wall to Maria.
Yeah.
Although, perhaps you have changed.
The look has become more severe.
Did something happen to you?
Do you want to know?
No.
Maybe another time.
I'll go.
See you soon.
So early?
Already?
Tomorrow is the training.
So I'm going to my village.
Maybe I'll find out something new.
Good night.
It's impossible to return Mom Kony to normal form, right?
Yes.
But if we continue to study the giants...
One day...
Are the giants people?
So far, it's just a theory.
About 60 years.
All this time.
I lived in an endless nightmare.
In a nightmare, then?
It's all so confusing.
Against whom are we fighting?
So what is it?
It turns out that the giants are ordinary people trapped in a nightmare?
For some time...
I was one of them.
Eren!
You still haven't finished your soup.
Eat first, then talk.
Yeah.
Sorry.
Mikasa.
I'm tired of it, Eren.
Lately, you've been doing the same thing,
that you're screwing yourself.
You'd better try to remember that man.
You told me yourself that you saw his memories in the cave.
The scout who crossed paths with your father.
Yes.
That day, he was definitely with my father.
He must know something.
Why does it feel like I've crossed paths with him before?
Not in the memory of Dr. JÃ¤ger?
Personally?
I think so.
Maybe I should hit you on the head?
Yeah, that's right.
That's the only thing you can do,
that you're holding on to the handle of history.
The instructor would have applied you.
If only it helped.
Wait.
Instructor of the Cadet Corps.
Kies Shadis!
Previous Commander of the Cadet Corps,
12th Commander of the Cadet Corps.
I haven't seen him for ages.
Instructor Shadis!
Kies Shadis!
Kies Shadis!
Previous Commander of the Cadet Corps,
12th Commander of the Cadet Corps.
Kies Shadis!
What's up, Abraus?
Are you gonna sit down?
No, I feel great about it too!
I called you in order to read it out.
It's only been a couple of months.
And I can't recognize you.
Commander Shadis.
I mean, the instructor.
We're preparing to return to the wall of Mary.
You're probably wondering why we're here.
Eron, you look just like your mother.
However, you inherited this harsh look from your father.
Tell us everything you know about him!
I don't know anything, to be honest.
However, I can tell you something.
I'm not going to tell you anything.
Yes, I don't know anything.
However, I can tell you an absolutely useless story.
The story of an observer.
The story of my past.
Twenty years ago, the wall of Mary.
It was right in front of the gates of Shiganshina.
Hey, you!
Where are you from?
How did you get through the wall?
Did you forget to get out of the wall?
Are you fighting?
Whether he was lying or not,
he claimed that he didn't remember how he got out of the wall.
He lost his memory.
He remembered that his name was Grisha Yeager.
Well, who knew that you couldn't go to the territory of the giants without permission, right?
I thought that only you, the scouts,
would be stupid enough to get out of the wall.
Isn't there a law that puts idiots in jail who drink at the service of Hanes?
Still, don't think he'll hurt anyone.
Come on, let's not write a report on him, okay?
Yeah.
So, what are you going to do now, Grisha Yeager?
Besides my name, I remembered something else.
I'm a doctor.
Will you take me to the hospital?
I think I'll be useful.
And can you tell me everything about this world and the scouts?
About the scouts?
And about you?
He really didn't know anything.
This world and nothing else.
That's right.
Despite the class division, the world reigns within the walls.
At least you don't live in fear of the giants.
Okay.
Okay, then.
Are you one of them?
Huh?
There are those within the walls who are happy to live in darkness,
while they have food and drinks.
They don't even think about how great this world is.
So that's why you're risking going behind the walls.
That's why there's scouting.
That's right.
Stupid, huh?
There's no such thing.
Scouts are wiser and braver than any of the residents of the walls.
Your existence proves the freedom of the human soul.
You're the pride of humanity.
Pride?
Me?
Yes.
Come on, kitty.
Are you trying to lure people to you again?
No, Carver, I'm just...
No, I'm definitely not suitable for this job.
I'll come back later.
Scouts are special.
You have to be chosen.
Oh, here it is.
To be chosen.
It's the first time I've heard something like this.
It wasn't true.
It's too tight inside the walls.
And another defeat.
When are you going to be strong enough to go behind the wall?
If I were a commander, I would have brought the result.
Stupid idiots.
Even you will realize my feats.
And then everyone will recognize me.
Grisha!
Carla's got her mind set on something.
Will you help her?
Put her down.
Dr. Yeager, my parents are sick too.
Don't worry, I'll save them all.
Dr. Yeager, my life is better.
Dr. Yeager, thank you.
Congratulations!
You are appointed as the commander of the reconnaissance legion.
Congratulations!
Congratulations, Dr. Yeager!
Damn it! Our base!
It didn't work!
Back off, commander!
The commander is always broken.
And only he survives.
They say that no one has died in Erwin's squad yet.
It's a pity that commanders can't be changed.
Be special.
Be chosen.
Kis?
Carla?
Who is it?
Aaron, our son.
The news doesn't seem to reach you.
My husband is worried about you.
Yeah, sorry.
Are you going to do this until you die?
It's time for you.
It's time for you.
Do you know why people burn their lives for no reason?
They lack imagination.
They live in vain.
And they don't even feel ashamed of their shitty life.
They don't become great.
No, they are not given this understanding.
They don't mean anything in this.
And the girls flirting with each other
are only able to pour cheap oil into the tavern.
Never!
That's right.
Ordinary people don't achieve anything.
Erwin, you can become a commander.
There are special people.
But I've never been one of them.
Why didn't such a simple truth reach me before?
The wall of the sea has fallen!
The Shiganshin district is destroyed!
The trust will be next!
Kis?
I'm late.
I understand.
It's your fault.
Erwin.
Wake up, Erwin.
Mom wasn't with you.
Father.
Mom.
The giants.
They ate me.
Erwin.
Take revenge for your mother.
You have to.
I know you can do it.
Let's go.
Wait.
Where are we going?
Don't follow us.
Wait.
Why don't you take revenge yourself?
Why don't you take revenge yourself?
Erwin.
Why don't you take revenge yourself for Karl?
It's because you're special.
Not like me.
So your son is special too.
What if he's not elected?
You want to break his life too?
This child is not like you.
He's my son.
Please, don't interfere.
Let's go.
Grom?
And then I took you away.
While you were unconscious, back to the shelter.
That's all I knew.
And that's it?
Now we know the real reason for your resignation.
Not because of repentance for all the dead,
but because of the inferiority complex.
Stop it, Hange.
To hell with your complexes.
Don't run from reality.
Isn't that what our oath is about?
Please stop, Hange.
The instructor is right.
I've never been someone special.
But...
I'm the son of a special person.
I'm the son of a special person.
I'm the son of a special person.
That's all.
Holy shit.
Carla said...
Is it necessary to be special?
Personally, I don't think so.
This child doesn't need to be great at all.
He shouldn't be better than others.
Come on, look at him.
He's so cute.
He's already special.
Because he was born in this world.
And you.
As your father wanted.
You decided to blow up the fire of your life,
which will burn to the brim.
As a result, I couldn't...
I couldn't change anything.
I'm just an observer.

in hope and fear,
they pray for the future of mankind.
Next.
The night of the battle for the wall.
