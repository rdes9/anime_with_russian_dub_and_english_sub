Dream
Finally, we are alone.
Father.
I'm sorry for making you wait.
Listen, Historia.
It may seem strange to you, but Frida is not quite dead.
Frida's memories are still alive.
You want to see your sister, don't you?
Yes.
Understand, Eren.
How can you take revenge for your mother?
No!
They're in.
What?
What is it?
Fire?
A gunpowder?
Judging by the flame, they attached it to the barrel with oil.
That's bad.
They're here.
Open fire!
Signal smoke?
Now don't take them on sight.
Twenty-four.
Thirty-two.
Thirty-five enemies.
They're hiding behind the columns.
Keep the plan.
Destroy the enemy.
Shoot them down.
Take them to the ring.
More smoke?
What?
Where are they?
They're here.
The anti-aircraft APC has a serious drawback.
The direction of the anchor's flight coincides with the line of fire.
So the area behind the back is completely open.
Over there!
Fire!
Missed!
Where are they?
Got you!
Sasha!
Kuni!
Hide behind the curtain and continue the fight!
Got you!
Bastard!
But there's another weakness.
After two shots,
they need time to recharge.
We're losing.
Yes, we are!
When the enemy breaks the distance, the sword is much more effective.
We have to get out of here.
We have to get out of here.
We have to get out of here.
We have to get out of here.
We have to get out of here.
We have to get them out of here.
We're done with this pace.
Hi, Levy.
I don't have time to play with you.
Everything's going to be over.
Oh, come on.
Let's play.
And you're gone.
You still haven't played enough?
All right.
You still haven't learned?
If you're chasing someone,
look around.
Don't move, son.
Damn it.
Really hurts.
Right in the face.
We have to somehow
get them to open up.
We have to somehow
get them to open up.
We have to somehow
get them to open up.
We need to open them up somehow.
Huh?
With both guns at once?
You like to take risks too, don't you?
No!
Kanji!
Back off!
Don't let them take the last post!
Regroup!
Stop messing around with me!
Get down!
We're protecting the ritual!
Yeah, and I'm going to go ahead.
Kanji!
Kanji!
Kanji!
Kanji!
I'm going to go ahead.
This is Manilibria.TV. Thank you for choosing us.
Looks like the enemy is close.
Let's hurry up.
Yeah.
What's going on, Eren?
Why are you shouting?
He got it.
What kind of fate awaits him.
The stolen power will be returned to the legitimate owner.
This is history.
It belongs to you.
This cave was created centuries ago with the help of the power of one giant.
Three walls were erected with the same power.
These huge walls ensured the safety of humanity.
And the same power of the giant was able to influence the hearts of people and change their memory.
However, not all people were under his control.
But their descendants, like all mankind, did not preserve the history of the world of the previous centuries.
Besides her, Frida Rai remembered everything.
Frida was not just a bearer of the power of the giant.
In one detail, she knew exactly how the world today was created.
When she acquired this knowledge, she was fifteen.
Right here, eight years ago, a girl ate her uncle, my younger brother.
Frida received the power of the founder and the memories of this world.
It was a hundred years ago.
The power of the generation was stored in our family.
But what about the power of the land and the land of the world?
The power of the land and the land of the world?
This is the power of the land and the land of the world.
As it was a hundred years ago, the power of generations was stored in our family.
Father...
Yes. If Frida had used her power, everything would have been fine now.
We could have erased the giants from the face of the earth.
But only his father stole this power from her.
Now this power is inside Eren.
But this power will not be subordinated to those whose veins flow blood into the heavens.
Until the power settles in him.
This hell will not end.
So...
What's going on?
Kenny.
So no one but Reiss will be able to become king?
Exactly.
So even if I become a giant and eat Eren, it won't give me anything?
What are you talking about?
Father!
You think I'm lying to you?
No.
I waited for this day only because I was sure that you were not lying about the ritual of inheritance.
You bastard! You knew perfectly well what I wanted, but you still continued to use it!
You pig!
I am grateful to you.
You are not the usual scoundrel who was adopted by my capricious younger brother.
One more word and your head will fly apart.
Stop it!
Let him go!
I feel sorry for you, history.
Don't you understand the truth?
Your father wants to turn you into a monster and make you eat poor Eren!
This is my duty.
Yes.
I will eat Eren and return my sister.
I will inherit the history of this world and destroy all giants.
Because this is my duty.
Oh, history.
Have you already forgotten how disgusting he was to you, son?
Only your blood worries him.
He himself does not want to turn to giants.
This scoundrel used his own brothers and daughters.
What a father you have!
Don't believe him, history.
I can't turn into a giant.
Don't listen to what others say.
So that's how it is.
Father!
Genie, you have served the right service.
Now you are free.
Find yourself another dream and live to old age.
This is too boring.
Genie, what are you thinking?
I will turn into giants and will not interfere.
However, there will be no forum.
You both will become giants and decide everything.
If history wins, the world will come.
But if Aron wins, everything will remain as it is.
You say live to old age and die?
Is it possible to call it life?
History, this injection will turn you into a strong giant.
But it's not enough to beat him.
You will need to eat his back brain.
That's it, and now it's better to leave.
Why, Aron, why don't you turn yourself into a giant?
If I turn into a giant, you're done.
Do something!
Well, history is over.
You are free.
You are free.
Well, history is over.
It shouldn't be like this.
Me and my father.
If five years ago my father had not done this,
your sister, she could have done something.
But my father did not.
But my father stole the power of giants from the legal owner.
How many lives did he buy?
Grandpa Armin, Thomas, Nag, Mina, Milius, Mark, Levi's detachment,
the inhabitants of Stochas, soldiers, save me.
Hannes.
I will never atone for my sin.
It shouldn't be like this.
All these trainings,
the ashes of life behind the wall.
I shouldn't be like this.
So it remains to let you finish this.
Eat me.
Save humanity.
Now everything is in your hands.
Aaron.
That time,
when you called me normal,
I...
I was happy.
So you're building a good one out of yourself.
What is the story?
Are you afraid?
You just need to introduce this liquid into the vein.
Father.
Why?
Why, Reiss family,
in these hundred years?
Why?
Why?
Why, Reiss family,
in these hundred years?
Why, Reiss family,
in these hundred years,
didn't kill giants
and didn't free humanity?
After all, we could control giants all this time.
The thing is that King Reiss,
who created our world inside the wall,
wished that giants would rule us.
He thought that only in this way
we could get harmony.
But I don't know why.
This knowledge is only available to the bearer of power.
A long, long time ago,
together with my brother,
we asked our father to save humanity.
However much we tried,
he always refused.
It was time,
and he had to play his part.
When my brother got the power of giants,
I looked him in the eye.
And then I realized
to create this world,
to be the basis of everything.
Only the almighty being
who became my brother is capable of this.
Do you know what it's called?
God.
We consider him
God.
And it's my duty
to bring God back to our world
and give him my prayers.
I pray.
History.
In the name of God,
who rules humanity.
Christ,
I understand I have no right
to tell you how to live.
But still,
listen to my selfish desire.
I want you to live with dignity.
History.
God.
What God?
It's all just a stupid excuse
for a pathetic manipulator.
I've had enough.
I won't let you kill me.
What a mood!
Clever!
What are you doing, History?
Aaron, we're leaving.
Hey, stop!
While I'm alive,
the rest will suffer!
Eat me already!
I won't take this kind of life!
Shut up, idiot!
Enough whining!
Get a grip!
What a mess!
I was going to kill all the giants!
I'm sick of people already!
Let them all be eaten by the giants!
I'm the main brother of humanity!
Understand,
there's no one worse than me in this world!
You're getting out of here,
and I'm going to destroy everything here!
Father,
Ori,
Frida,
be patient.
I'll be right back.
