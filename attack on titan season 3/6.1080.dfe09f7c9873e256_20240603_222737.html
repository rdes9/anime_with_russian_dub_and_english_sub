Aaron, are you awake?
Be patient, a little more
Don't be afraid
Can you tell me what happened ?
Eren, listen. My father has always been on the side of humanity.
All his life he defended and will defend the walls. We were wrong on his account.
I understand everything. He was a problem for the scouts, and the death of Pastor Nick on his conscience.
But he just had no other choice. My father has always acted for the good of his people.
History. Let me tell you the rest.
I remember something.
Exactly.
When I came to consciousness, I saw it.
How much time has passed?
Captain, Armin, what happened to the scouts?
What are these walls made of?
They shine.
Day, hour, or night.
Wait a minute.
I have a feeling like I've been here before.
Don't be afraid. This is the first time you've been here.
But I won't be surprised if you remember him.
What is he carrying?
Father, tell him everything.
Yes, I was just about to. But first I want to check something.
If we succeed, he will remember everything himself.
What is this? I don't remember this.
No. Whose memory is this?
The key!
What?
It can't be!
Father!
Well?
Now you remember the sin of your father.
Master Trapeze.
Master Trapeze.
Master Trapeze.
Master Trapeze.
Fading away, falling into the starry night
Like a goddess, hold me tight
Forever, flying to heaven
Episode 6. Sin
Great, Historia! You're doing so well already!
It's because you taught me.
Okay, let's wipe your nose.
You need to learn how to be more feminine.
Come on.
There you go! Good girl!
Sister, what does it mean to be feminine?
I don't know.
In my opinion, being feminine means being like this girl.
Christa?
Yes. You like Christa, don't you?
Yes.
Christa is very kind, and that's why she always takes care of others.
You need to try to be like her.
Our world is full of evil and suffering.
That's why you need to live so that others appreciate and love you.
Then, sister, I want to be like you.
What?
What do you think? When I grow up, will I be able to be like you?
You will! You will!
Me? Me?
Yes, you will!
I'm sorry, Historia, but I have to go.
You have to forget about me again.
Until we meet again.
Stop. Who was that?
Who was that?
What is it, Historia?
Why? Why couldn't I remember before?
I wasn't alone.
This girl was always by my side.
She brought books, taught me to read and write.
She was kind to me. How could I forget about her?
Did you know Frida?
Frida?
If that girl had long dark hair, it was most likely Frida Rice.
She was your step-sister.
Apparently, Frida was worried.
Now you wanted to visit her.
If she decided to erase your memory, it means she wanted to protect you.
What? Erase my memory?
Yes. It looks like you touched her.
Your memories have returned.
Listen, father.
Where is Frida's step-sister now?
I want to see her.
I wouldn't be here without her.
I want to thank her for what she did for me.
Frida is no longer with us.
I had five children.
But it so happened that my whole family, including Frida,
died at the hands of his father.
Grisha Yeager killed them all.
Grisha had the power to turn into a giant,
not knowing who he really was.
But he wanted to steal the power of the Rice family.
The power he wanted to obtain
was the power of the giants belonging to Frida.
The giant Frida overcame the power of everyone else.
In fact, her power was limitless.
However, Frida didn't have enough experience
to manage her properly.
Without giving her the potential,
Grisha devoured Frida and took over the power of the Rice family.
But he didn't have enough.
He attacked the other members of the family.
He really wanted the death of the Rice family.
A 12-year-old Dirk and a 14-year-old Abel were crushed.
He trampled my wife with a 10-year-old Floriana in his hands.
The last one died was Wilkins, the eldest of the sons.
I became the only one who managed to survive.
It can't be.
How?
Why did he do such a thing?
We've found time for an empty trap.
As if you don't know what's going on up there.
Kenny, what happened?
The scouts started a coup, and the rest are soldiers with them.
Everyone knows that the king is an impostor,
and the rest of the officials have been captured.
Your show is covered with a copper basin.
They'll get here one day.
Stop pulling the cat's tail.
Yeah, you're right.
Gather your anti-missile squad and go defend the exit.
I think I've already said that you and your team can't be present at the ceremony.
Your Majesty, have I upset you?
I'm sorry, I'm just worried about you.
Kenny, I completely trust you.
Go.
I trust you too, King.
From now on, your digestive system will be working backwards and forwards.
Also, you're not allowed to wear any clothes over your knees.
But of course, every week we will bring you to the public's attention.
Great.
This can become the greatest work of art.
All the years of waiting have been fully justified.
However, when you stand before the people who have been terrorizing for so long,
only then will this masterpiece be brought to an ideal.
Shut up!
You'll wait a little longer.
The blood of a slave flows in your veins,
and it is completely different from the blood of noblemen.
Very soon you will lose your memory and even learn to shit.
Why are you repeating yourself?
Didn't you come up with anything new?
Bad news, Erwin.
All the officials say the same thing.
Everything as your father expected.
The Rays are really capable of changing people's memories.
And if you believe the words of the officials,
and if you believe the words of the officials,
some families will not accept this power.
How is that possible?
If the Rays manage to get Erwin's scream,
our coup will be absolutely pointless.
It's obvious.
If you take into account how easily they reveal their secrets,
they are not sure that we will get ours.
I see.
In other words, we will forget the fact of the coup itself.
Whatever it is,
in my opinion, it is better to remember how he suffered in the hands of the Rays
than to lose everything at all.
I don't understand him.
How can you devote your whole life to such a goal?
Commander, did you know everything?
No.
I chatted too much.
Yes, you're right.
I figured out about Darius Zakle's ambitions.
I'm not as greedy as you are.
And we differ in the fact that I value the number of lives saved by me.
I supported you only because I believed that it was the best choice for mankind.
If the government were more preferential,
I would have been ready to stand on the path of Zakle.
Oh, come on.
I say that after I helped you make the coup.
I heard a song about the time when all wars will end,
but is it possible?
Commander!
All troops are ready to go!
We are waiting for your orders!
As long as at least one person lives,
the wars will never end.
I was hoping for a more original answer.
Everybody out!
We are starting our mission to return the era to their history.
According to our data, they are in the hourglass on the lands of the Rays.
Do you understand?
No, Kenny.
He is our main problem.
Do you think there is a second me on their side?
No, he is much more dangerous with his weapons.
Well, then he is definitely invincible for us.
We would not mind the help.
Excluded.
I agree.
The era can be eaten by us before dawn.
Although, even if the captain is right,
he certainly has weak points.
Are you sure?
Yes.
Maybe he trained, but did not use the drive in battle.
Amazing.
You spent your childhood with Kenny, but you know nothing about him.
How did it come out, Levi?
I'm sorry.
I just found out his full name.
Kenny Ackerman, that is.
He is your relative.
I heard from my parents that Ackerman's father's family was found in all the cities.
My mother's family was from the east,
so she also did not find a place in the cities.
Both of them.
People drove deep into the mountains at the edge of the walls.
There they met.
But I did not know why the Ackermans were persecuted.
Unlike my mother,
my father was not different in appearance.
Listen,
did you have a moment when you suddenly felt a powerful surge of power?
I did.
Kenny Ackerman experienced something like this.
Suddenly, a huge wave of power suddenly swept over him,
and the body itself began to move.
And the same thing happened to me.
Old man, do not be silent.
You're about to die.
Kenny,
did you kill the military police?
Yes.
If you're talking about the assholes around you,
then they went to the abduction.
I found out here
that we have relatives in the north of Ushiganshin.
But even in such a deafening silence,
our family does not allow us to live peacefully,
so they are not sweet now.
Why is that?
Were the Ackermans not warriors close to the king?
And now our family is almost on the verge of extinction.
How did you manage to make the king angry?
Well, come on, tell your dear grandson.
Did you call yourself a dear grandson?
And this says that there is no horror in the whole capital, Kenny?
The king is not angry at the Ackermans at all.
He's just afraid of us.
The fact is that he cannot manage the family and the Ackerman.
Manage?
I myself do not know all the details,
but our family and the truth once served the king.
We used to be his sword
and one of the most important supporters.
But the fact is that the king's power of giants is inherited.
The power of giants? What is it?
Unimaginable power,
capable of changing people's memories,
making them forget their past.
But not all families are under the power of the king.
Among them were two groups that turned away from the king.
They were the Eastern clan and the Ackerman family.
From here and the chase.
Horrible story.
I'm not sure if I should tell you this now,
but I found my younger sister.
She used to work in a brothel underground.
She flew in from the client.
She didn't listen to me and gave birth to me.
Bastard.
To be born in such a disgusting world.
Not a single dream deserves such suffering.
Found it.
Secret entrance.
Aaron should be that way.
I hope I guessed right with the situation inside.
Our surprise should be bought.
Otherwise, we shouldn't have tried.
There are at least seven opponents at the top.
And Levi for sure will be among them.
You know.
That time we managed to get him down.
But he still beat 12 fighters.
The rest of the police have already left the game.
And the government has lost control.
The situation is terrible.
If we decide to give up,
life for us in this tiny world
will be scarier than death.
But think about it.
Is life inside these walls?
What's the difference?
The enemy can't beat us.
We just have to wait.
Until he breaks through the wall and kills us.
We decided to join the police.
We wanted to move to the center and join Kenny.
And all this for the sake of finding meaning
in this stupid world.
Let's believe to the end.
Only Kenny's dream can change this world for the better.
There we go.
We can start.
Exactly.
Are you ready to get your hands dirty with blood?
I think so.
