There's a sea behind the wall, that's what Armin said, and behind the sea, I've always been interested in what's there.
I don't know.
That's the truth.
One, two, three.
Episode one. Signal fire.
Sasha, just try to take something. Levi will cut you into pieces in a second.
I'm not going to.
Come on.
Hey, you! What's wrong with you? No one taught you to wipe your feet!
What are you doing? Can't you see how much we had to drag?
You think Captain Levi will make such an excuse?
You're going to pay for the fact that I filled your bed!
Shut up! Did you fool my mom?
We're back.
Did you cut the firewood?
I just warmed up.
You got it from the giant. You haven't recovered yet.
Actually, I tried to talk her out of it. She even sat down in the morning.
Asshole! You even peeked!
Huh?
What do you mean, peeked?
Mikasa, you're impudent.
You know, it's like we're back in the cadet corps.
What do you think? Why did Levi choose us for his new squad?
Defending the era for their history is a very important mission.
We're just good enough.
Sasha, what did you put in your bag?
It wasn't bread at all.
Hey, I told you!
Give it back!
People, we need to finish cleaning up before the captain comes back.
Come on, give the bread back.
What's going on here?
How much can we eat?
We don't have enough food anyway.
Stop it already, potato!
I haven't been here for a long time.
Okay, we'll discuss the quality of your cleaning later.
Aaron, will Ange wait or not until the beginning of the experiment?
Yeah, okay.
Aaron!
What's going on, Aaron? Get up!
The fate of all mankind depends on you!
Get up, come on!
Look, this time he's not the same as usual.
He doesn't even have 10 meters and his muscles are deformed.
And Aaron's ass is sticking out.
I see!
Aaron, can you still move?
Let us know if you hear!
Aaron!
Mikasa!
Well, this silence again acts without an order.
You need to be punished for this.
No, he doesn't answer.
It's time to act.
Aaron!
Damn it!
It's so hot!
Ange, wait!
He's bleeding!
Look at his face!
Aaron's face!
Draw it quickly!
Commander!
Man suffers!
Sorry, I forgot a little.
We're still far from the goal.
To get to the wall, we need the strength to confirm the giants.
Yes, I understand that we rely too much on luck.
In fact, the plan is not so bad.
We will not have to carry out the materials.
It will be enough to deliver Aaron there.
And without luck, there is no way.
It all depends on Aaron.
End of the operation!
Disperse with all troops!
Roger!
There should be no witnesses.
Yes!
You will go with Aaron, and we will go with Ange to the cable.
Understood.
Take this girl away immediately!
This girl!
Only she can know the truth that is hidden from us!
I see.
Fail again.
If this plan worked,
the hole in Shiganshina could be closed in one day.
We don't have enough information.
It's a pity that there is no help for the giants,
but it wouldn't hurt us.
But there is Christ.
That is, the history of Christ.
Perhaps with her help,
we will be able to save the world.
Yes.
We will be able to save the world.
Yes.
That is, the history of Christ.
Perhaps with her help,
we will find out something about the walls.
I have already read the report about her origin.
The illegitimate daughter of Lord Reis.
Her story is sad.
But there is something strange here.
How can an ordinary messenger know about the secrets of the walls?
Aaron!
You can't get up yet!
I'm fine.
I didn't sleep all day.
Besides,
Maria's restoration plan is delayed because of me.
It's not your fault.
Don't tease yourself.
I have only one goal.
I want to avenge the beast.
Whoever he may be,
I will never forgive him.
It's time for us to change the clock.
Mikasa.
It's good for you.
You have at least something to strive for with the others.
Well, after leaving the world,
I don't even know what I want.
I don't even know what I want.
I don't know what I want.
I don't know what I want.
I don't even know what I want.
Don't you want to save the world?
Well,
I didn't understand then.
Why did she do that?
Well, now the thoughts have cleared up.
The world itself chose how to live.
I have no right to decide for her.
And I don't want to.
Well, finally.
I'm talking about the fact that you're talking again.
When we got here,
you told us about yourself.
But since then, you've never smiled.
You didn't even talk.
It hurts.
I'm sorry.
That was an obedient, sweet girl.
There is no more of this Christ.
Well, I think it's even better.
You used to be some kind of impure.
Your pretense has also become impure.
That's how it is.
However, now you have finally opened up.
Yes, Odori is honest, but normal.
Well, you have time to think about the world.
In general, I ...
Stop.
Really?
Hanji and the squad have returned.
Everyone to the main hall.
Hmm?
What's there?
Pastor Nick died.
He was killed.
In the morning in the barracks.
Hey!
You can't go to the crime scene!
Not a step further.
Now it's our business.
Another robbery.
It's not so rare in our time.
What?
Do you think I'll believe it?
His nails are torn out.
What department are you from?
The commander of the 4th unit Hanji Zoe and her deputy Mowbrit Barner.
Even if you are the chief commander of the scouts,
you will still remain a demand.
Listen, he was clearly killed not by giants.
Killing people.
What is the purpose of your competence?
1st unit.
Military police?
Why?
What did the police and the capital forget in the cane?
What's the matter?
Unlike you, the head cutter,
we have every soldier busy with his business.
Oh, here it is.
I'm really worth nothing.
I was lucky to meet such brave soldiers.
Let me shake your hand.
Oh, it's a pity that they attacked Nick.
Poor guy.
Did he have any valuable things?
Of course.
They do business with the church in the form of valuable metals.
What?
Nick was a follower of the cult of the walls?
What are you talking about?
He was just my friend.
Besides, he told me that he was engaged in furniture.
I even wrote it in a statement.
It looks like it.
In fact, I was very wrong.
If I thought I knew Nick well.
Hey, let go!
Oh, sorry, I'm sorry.
Okay, good luck in the investigation.
When you find the culprit, tell him this.
Maybe you think you did the right thing.
However, I am not at all concerned about your conscience.
I guarantee that bastards will torture you
just like my friend.
And your fate will be much worse.
Yes, you will regret it.
Tell them that.
We're leaving.
Commander, are you sure it was them?
Yes.
The first squad.
Jail Sanas.
His knuckles were broken.
Nick was attacked by the military police.
They killed him.
I assumed that the church would want to get rid of Nick
because of our cooperation.
Therefore, I hid his identity.
I didn't want to hurt him.
Therefore, I hid his identity and hid it in the barracks.
Who knew that they used soldiers for murder?
I lost my vigilance.
It's all my fault.
Military police.
They tortured Nick
to find out what information he gave us.
Exactly.
But since the military police are involved here,
there must be something else.
By the way, how many nails were torn out by him?
You saw it, didn't you?
How many?
I just glanced at him.
But he had no nails at all.
They start talking after the first one.
The next ones are not so sick.
Pastor Nick.
I always thought he was an idiot.
But he never turned away from what he believed.
It means they have no idea
what we know about the Reiss family.
However, the government is thinking of something
and they are watching us.
Commander!
You have a message from Commander Erwin.
I came to tell him about Pastor Nick.
He gave me this and sent me here.
Everybody out.
We're leaving.
Don't leave any traces.
We barely made it.
If we didn't leave, what would happen to us?
But why did Commander Erwin give such an order?
The order came from above.
The police are searching the station outside the walls.
They want to tell Erwin their story.
By the way, as soon as he gave me the message,
the military police came after him.
He's being held as a criminal.
It looks like someone came out of the wall.
Now they're acting openly.
They went so far to protect the secret of the walls.
Why did they need Erwin with the story?
Why didn't they kill him?
What do they want?
Who knows?
I only know one thing.
The enemy is hunting for these two.
It's dangerous here.
Let's send her to the line with Erwin.
Why?
Didn't they kill Pastor Nick there?
It will be even more dangerous closer to the center.
It will be easier to slip through the line without an order.
But in the extreme case, we will have this.
That's right.
Besides, we don't know who our enemy is.
We need to find out who's behind all this.
Hanje, give me people from your squad.
Okay.
Okay, I'll go after Erwin.
Moblitz, come with me.
The rest stay on the left.
Yes!
Hanje!
Here.
I remembered the conversation and the world with Bertold.
I didn't have time to tell you, so here.
Okay.
I'll take a look a little later.
They took their legs away quickly.
All thanks to the lesson of that grimy brat.
Do you know him?
Yes.
No big groups.
Don't stand out.
The era of history.
Behave as usual.
Why are there flags of the royal family everywhere?
Oh, today is the King's anniversary.
Once a year they distribute a bunch of rations.
We're starting to distribute rations.
King Fritz heard about the difficult situation of the throne,
and donated reserves to the royal family.
Enough for everyone.
Stand in line.
Yes, lucky.
Long live King Fritz.
God, protect the king.
What a king!
Generous ruler.
He doesn't know where to put the wealth.
The people have always been weak at such donations.
Mitra.
The distribution of rations consumes more than 60% of the reserves.
Don't you think it's too much?
Lord Reiss.
It is necessary.
The royal family must receive approval from its people.
Besides, we need to capture the targets.
And as soon as possible.
The police failed again.
I will immediately resume the search.
No, the goal will be achieved soon.
Something is already in action.
Watch out!
Back!
Armin!
Who are you?
Heron of Christ!
Someone is kidnapping them forever!
Will it work?
He doesn't look like me at all.
Horse face.
Well, do you like it?
You can not hold back.
Come on, you like it.
I want to hear your sweet voice until death.
That's why I didn't want to repeat it again.
I hate to replace it.
How is the situation inside?
If we don't hurry, they will reveal Armin.
I'm worried about him.
I see.
How is the leg?
Does it still hurt?
I can move.
Not bad.
What is more important, these kidnappers are ordinary lovers.
Why did they send them?
You can handle it yourself.
I'll go to Heron.
And you follow me here.
Yes, sir.
And I'll tell you just in case.
Tell Armin and the rest.
Are you sure this is Christ and Heron?
Yes, that's how they were described.
Where is the guard?
What the ...
Don't move.
Coney, there were definitely four of them.
Yes, exactly.
No one else.
Next time I'll shoot in the hand.
Great.
First we will connect them.
And then we go to the captain.
What are you talking about?
Captain's order.
And also a message.
Hey, get out of the way.
Captain.
What is it?
The street is overflowing, but nothing unusual.
There is little left before Commander Pixis.
What about the second mission?
Completed.
And yet you are not happy with something.
Yes.
Something is wrong.
Believe me.
Something is wrong.
The police did not come.
They are too arrogant to use amateurs.
And if you assume that they are watching the train,
then the group should be persecuted.
Captain.
The van is moving again.
Nifa, have you heard about the Kenia woman?
The serial killer from the capital?
The one who stabbed hundreds of military police officers.
But isn't this an old urban fairy tale?
He exists.
And the story about him is true.
When I was a child, I had to live with him.
What?
How do you understand this?
It's not the time for jokes now.
Exactly.
He would not have teased the lovers.
The group of persecution should surround the target
and take a high position with a good view.
Nifa!
Hi, Levi.
Haven't you grown up yet?
Oh, I see you haven't lost your grip.
Kenia!
Kenia and Levi have met.
The goal of the enemies was an era of history.
To bring them back, Levi and his friends
will have to enter the enemy's state.
In the next episode.
Pain.
