That day, humanity remembered
The shadows that advance in the darkness are not owned by anyone
The uncertain future always blooms on the surface
Every time the night comes
With cold hands, we gently rubbed our necks
Betraying the past, we cling to the back of hope
Even if we know that we're heading for the hell we've been chasing
If you want to see the continuation of your dreams, what can you do?
The devil is that chance-gator
He follows the path with his own hands
What's beyond that wall?
We longed for our childhood days
The truth is right outside, at the end of the dead-end road
The miracle of the fingers running through
We spread our wings
Even if our hearts are torn apart
We'll reach the end of the night
The sun hasn't set yet
That's why we keep moving forward
To the other side of the sea
Episode 7 â€“ The basement
Armin, lie down!
It hurts... It hurts...
It hurts...
Who are you?
It hurts...
It hurts...
Sasha?
Sasha!
It's a terrible wound!
What happened?
Armin!
It's a terrible wound...
I'm so glad you're back!
He's awake!
Captain?
I don't understand...
What's going on?
I remember how Bertolt transformed himself
Where are the others?
So you don't remember anything else?
Eren, tell him
Well?
Any questions, Armin?
Could it be...
Out of all the intelligence corps
there are only nine people left?
What do you mean?
It looks like it
We tried to find the survivors
But we couldn't find anyone in all four hours
So after we sealed the gate from the Shiganshins
Reiner and the animal-like ran off to the third giant
We caught Bertolt
And Erwin and I were about to die
And you couldn't decide who to give the injection to
As a result, I became a giant
I grabbed him
Here
Well?
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
But...
Why me?
Why me?
Why me?
Why me?
Why me?
Why me?
Why me?
I told him everything
I told him everything
Your friends
Your friends didn't share your logic
Your friends didn't share your logic
There was a fight
There was a fight
We are ready to take any punishment
Don't you think that taking punishment
will somehow make up for your actions?
No
Listen
I decided to choose you
I decided to choose you
No
I told him to kill Erwin right here.
I don't understand.
We shouldn't have let Erwin die.
If Commander is gone, what are we going to do next?
Me too.
I think Erwin should be saved.
That's my opinion.
No.
The main thing is not to mess with each other anymore.
In the end, Erwin trusted Levy's syringe himself.
And Levy decided to choose you.
And this is not discussed.
Now you are in response to the sacrifice of Erwin and the power of the giant.
No matter what you say, this is the reality.
Armin.
Now I have to replace Commander Erwin.
But I can't do it.
Don't talk nonsense.
You can't replace Erwin.
However, you have the power that no one else has.
It's true.
Don't make me feel sorry for the choice.
These two shouldn't feel guilty.
And most importantly,
don't blame yourself.
You can think of it as an order.
Shut up!
Shut up!
Yes, Sasha, as always.
Well, since Commander Erwin's call comes to me,
I also feel a sense of responsibility.
We need to be more decisive.
Yes.
Okay.
Since Armin has already recovered, we need to move.
Levy and I will take Mikasa and Eren to the intelligence.
The other four will stay here and watch the surroundings.
Yes.
Eren, do you still have the key?
Yes.
I have it.
Eren, when I come back,
I'll show you what secrets are hidden in the basement.
No, Eren!
I told you you can't go to the basement!
What's wrong with that?
Father keeps his tools there.
And medicine.
You can get hurt.
This is our chance.
Hope for the salvation of humanity is the key.
Most likely, the answers to all questions about the giants
are hidden under the house of Eren in Shigansh.
If we get to this basement,
we will get information with which
we will put an end to their century-old domination.
Hey, Viginus!
Yes.
THE END
THE END
THE END
THE END
It's here.
THE END
Listen, Dad,
when will you show me the basement?
Well,
after you understand what's really important.
Grisha Yeager, who came out of the wall,
entrusted the key to his son from the basement.
We're lucky the fire didn't get here.
It's here.
Somewhere here.
The entrance to our basement.
Great.
We're lucky it didn't get here.
Let's go.
Eren,
give it to me.
What is it?
Eren.
Come on.
The key.
It's not the one.
It doesn't fit the door.
But Dr. Yeager always carried it with him.
Step aside.
I'll open it.
Wait.
Don't move.
Don't.
That's weird.
It looks like a lab.
It looks like a lab.
Dad was a doctor.
He often came down here to make medicine.
I see.
Well,
if you believe the inscriptions on the bottles,
it's just regular medicine.
And all the books about medicine,
it's just a doctor's office.
Nothing out of the ordinary.
At least that's what it looks like at first glance.
But if he's hiding from the Center's police,
we won't be able to find anything.
Hey,
start looking.
A little bit of Erwin never let me down.
Got it.
Thank you, Mikasa.
I don't have time to sleep again.
Erwin.
There's a well here.
Erwin.
He's gone.
It's empty.
Be careful.
There's a double bottom.
It smells of mint oil and coal.
Probably for protecting from moisture and insects.
Looks like we finally found it.
We finally found what we were looking for.
What did my father want to show me?
And then Erwin asked his father,
how do we know that no one lives behind the wall?
He said that since we can't go far behind the walls,
we have no proof that the giants ate all of humanity.
All of our inscriptions,
all of the bottles,
all of the bottles,
the giants ate all of humanity.
All of our inscriptions clearly indicate the death of humanity.
However,
if these inscriptions are objective,
it would be said that it is believed that humanity has been eaten up.
I think you're just getting to the point.
No,
there is a hidden motive here.
For example,
someone wants us to believe that there are no survivors behind the walls.
The government,
they could have rewritten the story on purpose.
You're just getting to the point.
You shouldn't bother so much.
Then I didn't take it seriously,
and as you can see, it was in vain.
You should apologize to him.
It's time to say goodbye.
It's time for our heroes to come back.
The intelligence corps has just returned from the mission.
We managed to get Maria back to the wall.
Is this a portrait?
Let me have a look.
No,
an ordinary person wouldn't be able to draw something like this.
There's something written on the back.
This is not a drawing.
The image was created with the help of light capture
and burning on special paper.
This is a photo.
I came to you from the outer world,
where people live in luxury.
Humanity has not died out at all.
I really hope that my fellow human beings will find this book.
This is a photo.

Seriously, Fey, hurry up!
We won't see it unless we hurry.
Wait a minute, Beotech.
Wait a minute, Fey, wait a minute.
I've been asking you to leave the home without a salute.
Hey, wait!
I got it, mom!
We won't be long!
Let's go!
Starting my story, I want to tell you about that memorable day.
Ouch!
I'm sorry!
Be careful!
Look where you're going!
Oh, I'm flying!
That's great!
If I get rich, will I be able to fly on such an airship?
What are you talking about?
We can't get rich, can we?
Wow!
But I can dream!
I wonder what it looks like from there!
I'm flying!
I'm flying!
Let's go, Fei!
What?
The teacher told me that they land right next to each other!
Let's take a look!
But mom said that we can't go outside the walls!
Don't worry, we won't be long!
We'll be back soon!
Fei!
Stop right there!
That day, in my childhood, a cruel reality broke in.
Holding hands, they look up at the sky with their sister.
That's how his story began.
With his eyes, Eren sees hope from the forehead of this cruel world.
Then, that day...
